WellingtonDeOliveira,Suicide Note,"You should first know that the impure cannot touch me without gloves, only the chaste or those who lost their chastity after marriage and were not involved in adultery can touch me without gloves, or, in other words, no fornicator or adulterer can have direct contact with me, nor anything that is impure can touch my blood, nothing impure can have direct contact with a virgin without his permission, those who prepare my burial should take off all my clothes, wash me, dry me and wrap me totally naked in a white sheet that is in this building, in a bag that I left in the first room on the first floor, after they have wrapped me in this sheet they can put me in my coffin. If possible, I want to be buried next to the grave where my mom sleeps. My mom’s name is Dicea Menezes de Oliveira and she is buried in the Murundu cemetery. I need to be visited at my grave by a faithful follower of God at least once, he must pray in front of my grave and ask God’s forgiveness for what I did praying that upon his return Jesus wakes me from the sleep of death for eternal life. I left a house in Sepetiba which no family needs, there are poor institutions, financed by generous people, that take care of abandoned animals, I want this space where I passed my final months donated to one of these institutions, because the animals are being very despised and need much more protection and care than human beings who have the advantage of being able to communicate, to work to feed themselves, so those who take ownership of my house, I ask you to please have some common sense and abide by my request, automatically they will be fulfilling the wishes of my parents who wanted to pass this property to my name and everybody knows this, comply with my request otherwise they automatically will be disrespecting my parents’ wishes, which would prove that all of you have no consideration for our parents who now sleep, I believe that all of you have some consideration for our parents, proving this by doing what I asked",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SeunHuiCho,Manifesto,"Oh the happiness I could have had mingling among you hedonists, being counted as one 
of you, only if you didnâ€™t fuck the living shit out of me.
You could have been great. I could have been great. Ask yourself what you did to me to have 
made me clean the slate. Only if you could be the victim of your reprehensible and wicked crimes, you Christian Nazis, you would have brute-restrained your animal urges to fuck me.
You could be at home right now eating your fucking caviar and your fucking cognac, had 
you not ravenously raped my soul. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Can you feel the pain that you 
fucked us in, you Descendants of Satan? Well, can you feel it? All the shit youâ€™ve given me, right back at you with hollow points. Donâ€™t you just wish you finished me off when you had the chance? Donâ€™t you just wish you 
killed me?  You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today, but you decided to spill 
my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. 
Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off, you Apostles of Sin. 6 Congratulations. You have succeeded in extinguishing my life. Vandalizing my heart wasnâ€™t 
enough for you. Raping my soul wasnâ€™t enough for you. Committing emotional sodomy 
on me wasnâ€™t enough for you. Every single second wasted on your wanton hedonism and 
menacing sadism could have been used to prevent today. Ask yourselves, What was I doing 
all this time? All these months, hours, seconds. Only if you could have been the victim of 
your crimes. Only if you could have been the victim . . . To you sadistic snobs, I may be nothing but a piece of dog shit. You have vandalized my 
heart, raped my soul, and torched my conscious again and again. You thought it was one 
pathetic, void life that you were extinguishing. Thanks to you, I die, like Jesus Christ, to 
inspire generations of the Weak and Defenseless people â€” my Brothers, Sisters, and Chil-
dren â€” that you fuck.
Like Moses, I spread the sea and lead my people â€” the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent 
Children of all ages that you fucked and will always try to fuck â€” to eternal freedom. Thanks to 
you Sinners, you Spillers of Blood, I set the example of the century for my Children to follow

Do they wanna fuck us and pretend to be devout Christians? Do they wanna smear dog shit 
on our face then give us a dirty towel to wipe away? Do they wanna rape us then give us 
stained toilet paper to clean up? Do they wanna cut our throat then give us a used band aid 
to patch up? Do they wanna perpetrate endless sessions of crucifixions and holocausts on our 
innocent life then go to church and praise the Lord and Jesus? Do they wanna fuck us and 
pretend to be Jesus Christ? I say weâ€™re the Jesus Christs, my Brothers, Sisters, and Children. 
Jesus Christ exists in us all: Ax Jesus Christ, John Jesus Christ, Jane Jesus Christ, Seung Jesus 
Christ, Carlos Jesus Christ, Hakeem Jesus Christ, Mohammad Jesus Christ, Zhang Jesus 
Christ, Oliver Jesus Christ, Elizabeth Jesus Christ, Vladimir Jesus Christ. ___________ Jesus 
Christ. I say there is no pain they can inflict on us that they havenâ€™t already inflicted. I say 
they canâ€™t fuck us any more than they have already done. I say there are no lies they can say 
about us that they havenâ€™t already said. I say fuck you, you Descendants of Satan Disguised 
as Devout Christians. I say we take up the cross, take up our guns and knives and hammers, 
and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath and last ounce of energy. Seer of Veracity. Seal of the Anti-Terrorist. You wanna rape us John Mark Karrs? You wanna rape us Debra LaFaves? Fuck you.
By destroying we create. We create the feelings in you of what it is like to be the victim, what 
it is like to be fucked and destroyed. Because of your annihilations, we create and raise new 
breeds of Children who will show you fuckers what you have done to us. Like Easter, it will 
be a day of rebirth. It will be a start of a revolution of the Children that you fucked. You have 
never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life, thus, by destroying you, by giving you pain, 
we attempt to show you responsibilities and meanings of other peopleâ€™s lives. Itâ€™s grand for you to fuck us 24/7 for fun, but we canâ€™t have a single minute of harmless 
playtime, only suffer. Itâ€™s dandy for you to rape us, but weâ€™re not allowed to even speak, only 
be raped? Fuck you.
You love to pretend to, but you Hedonists, Charlatans, Sadists, Rapists, Terrorists will never 
know the feelings of giving up your lives for a cause. You have never felt a single ounce of 
pain in your hedonistic lives. You will never give up a single can of your Bud Light, a shot 
of your cognac, or a half-drop of your own precious blood for another human being, only 
fuck the shit out of him and lie afterwards. You fucked us, now we fuck you, now we kill 
you. There can be no lighter penalty for Masqueraded Democratic Terrorists who commit 
unforgivable acts of treason against mankind. There is no where in the world you can run, 
you Lovers of Terrorism. There is nowhere in the world you can hide, you Lovers of Sadism. 
You will never know when and where the Weak and Defenseless that you fucked will strike 
â€” day, night, at school, in the public, in your home, during your most comfortable hour and 
protected place. You will never know how we will kill you â€” slash your throat, bullet in your 
back, torture you with knives, hammers, bolt cutters, scissors. You will always live in fear. 
You will never be able to go to school or work or rest or sleep. Your heart will always pound 
nonstop. Your sin-ridden soul will slowly eat up your conscious for the heinous crimes you have committed. So if you donâ€™t want to die a painful death, do yourself a favor, do yourself 
a coup de grace, and kill yourself clean or you will endure pains you can never feel but with 
our hands. Kill yourself or we will hound you down and rip you, all your friends, and all 
your family into small pieces.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SeunHuiCho,Manifesto,"We have no sympathy in killing humans who have no respect for other peopleâ€™s lives.  Now that the slate has been cleaned and you have the worldâ€™s attention, the question is what 
are you going to do? Are you going to admit the truth or are you going to stand resolute on 
your mission to eternally fuck the Weak and the Defenseless and lie about it? Are you still 
going to use your power and manipulate the truth to end up with some sort of profit as you 
have always done? Are you going to skip over all the crimes youâ€™ve committed and act as 
victims to the world so you can suck in millions of donation money to turn the situation 
into a profit? Your two million dollar house wasnâ€™t enough? Your BMW wasnâ€™t enough? Your 
inheritances werenâ€™t enough? You have to fuck and steal form the Poor and the Weak who 
have nothing in order to gratify your fucking pride and hedonism? What are you going to 
do with the blood money? Buy a new Mercedes? You want to brainwash your bratty, snobby 
kids that its right to steal from the poor, the Weak, and the Defenseless to always stay in 
power? The fat surpluses that you roll on everyday arenâ€™t enough? Fuck you. Your answer 
rings loud and clear. I saw we take up the cross, Children of Ishmael, take up our guns and 
knives and any sharp objects, and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath 
and last ounce of energy. The blood of the Innocents should never be shed, but the wicked we shall spread our wings and strike. We do not want the Weak, the Defenseless, or the Innocent, but the sadistic, the 
corrupt, and the wicked who prey and rape from the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent. 
We will seek and demolish them until our last breath. You Lifetakers may have succeeded in 
raping our souls and shattering our dreams â€” but mark our words â€” the vendetta you have 
witnessed today will reverberate throughout every home and every soul in America and will 
inspire the Innocent kids that you have fucked to start a war of vendetta. We will raise hell 
on earth that the world has never witnessed. Millions of deaths and millions of gallons of 
blood on the streets. will not quench the avenging phoenix that you have caused us to unleash. Generation after generation, we martyrs, like Eric and Dylan, will sacrifice our lives to fuck you thousand 
folds for what you Apostles of Sin have done to us.
Pain of every atom between air and water, sky and ground, heaven and hell, life and death 
wouldnâ€™t begin to explain the experience that we went through under your wrath.
What did you expect me to do, you violators of human rights? As the time approached, I wished for a last minute miracle and discard this mission youâ€™ve 
given me. Heaven knows I wouldnâ€™t hurt a single leaf of a flower. But when the time came, 
I did it. I had to. What other choices did you give me? All this time. . . You never know that 
a human being is capable of doing until you fuck him to the edge. When youâ€™re raped of everything, you got nothing to lose. If you have a single milligram of conscience, a grain of integrity, a speck of heart, you will kill yourself for all the lives you have brutally extinguished. Can you now see all that used to be, all that could have been, and all that is to come, you Sadistic Charlatans. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Long live the revolution... revolution against the system,
which enslaves not only the majority of weak-minded
masses but also the small minority of strong-minded
and intelligent individuals! If we want to live in a different
world, we must act. We must rise against the enslaving,
corrupted and totalitarian regimes and overthrow the
tyrants, gangsters and the rule of idiocracy. I can't alone
change much but hopefully my actions will inspire all the
intelligent people of the world and start some sort of
revolution against the current systems. The system
discriminating naturality and justice, is my enemy. The
people living in the world of delusion and supporting this
system are my enemies.
I am ready to die for a cause I know is right, just and
true... even if I would lose or the battle would be only
remembered as evil... I will rather fight and die than live
a long and unhappy life.
And remember that this is my war, my ideas and my
plans. Don't blame anyone else for my actions than
myself. Don't blame my parents or my friends. I told
nobody about my plans and I always kept them inside
my mind only. Don't blame the movies I see, the music I
hear, the games I play or the books I read. No, they had
nothing to do with this. This is my war: one man war
against humanity, governments and weak-minded
masses of the world! No mercy for the scum of the
earth! HUMANITY IS OVERRATED! It's time to put

Screenshot of Wikipedia article on the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting. Holmes went to his car (which he had parked near the exit door), changed into protective clothing, and retrieved his guns. About 30 minutes into the movie, police say, around 12:30 a.m., he reentered the theater through the exit door. Holmes was dressed in black and wore a gas mask, a load-bearing vest, a ballistic helmet, bullet-resistant leggings, a bullet-resistant throat protector, a groin protector, and tactical gloves. He was listening to techno music through a set of headphones so that he could not hear anything from people in the theater. Initially, few in the audience considered Holmes to be a threat. Some witnesses thought he was wearing a costume, like other audience members who had dressed up for the screening. 666 the number of the beast Halloween knife game the final knife game song the knife game song.

Because they lack power and control in their lives. The fantasy of hurting others is a power based fantasy. It stems from the desire to have more control over others.

Perhaps someone they like doesnâ€™t like them back. They might feel rejected. Feelings of rejection can be quite painful.

MarcLepine,Suicide Note,"Would you note that if I commit suicide today 89-12-06 it is not for economic reasons (for 
I have waited until I exhausted all my financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political 
reasons. Because I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to 
their Maker. For seven years life has brought me no joy and being totally blasé, I have decided 
to put an end to those viragos. I tried in my youth to enter the Forces as an officer cadet, which would have allowed me possibly to get into the arsenal and precede Lortie in a raid. They refused me becauase antisocial. I therefore had to wait until this day to execute my plans. In between, I continued my 
studies in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in advance my fate. 
Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks despite my theory of not handing 
in work and the lack of studying before exams. Even if the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the media, I consider myself a 
rational erudite that only the arrival of the Grim Reaper has forced to take extreme acts. For 
why persevere to exist if it is only to please the government. Being rather backward-looking 
by nature (except for science), the feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep 
the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a 
preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men. us it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting 
to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they [do not] neglect to profit from the 
knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them 
every time they can. Thus, the other day, I heard they were honoring the Canadian men 
and women who fought at the frontline during the world wars. How can you explain [that 
since] women were not authorized to go to the frontline??? Will we hear of Caesar’s female 
legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50% of the ranks of history, though 
they never existed. A real Casus Belli. Sorry for this too brief letter. Nearly died today. The lack of time (because I started too late) has allowed these radical 
feminists to survive.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GangLu,Letter,"How are you! Please deposit the enclosed check in the back speedily. This letter is written 
especially to you, so don’t let other people in the family see it. When you read this letter, 
I will probably no longer be in the world of the living. I have already mailed some things 
back, which can be considered to constitute my legacy. I think that as long as you explain 
it to the customs officials, they will let these things pass through, just as if I had brought 
them back myself. 
What I am most worried about is our parents; they are old, and I am afraid they will not be 
able to bear this turmoil. But I am at the end of my resources, so this heavy responsibility 
must fall on your shoulders. I beg you to take care of them and spare no expenses in the 
effort. Moreover, don’t spend any money on a funeral for me. And by all means don’t come 
to the U.S. to take my body home. The best thing would be to let the Chinese embassy have 
my body cremated here in the U.S., and just send some ashes back. Keep firmly in mind 
that you should not let anyone here in the U.S. blackmail you into paying anything. I think 
the money I have sent back will suffice to repay our parents’ loving kindness in raising me 
and the gentle care my two elder sisters gave me when I was young.
Last night when I finished talking with you on the telephone, I wept my heart out here alone. 
For the life of me, I can’t swallow all this. You know that all my life I have been honest and 
straightforward, and I have most of all detested cunning, fawning sycophants and dishonest bureaucrats who think they are always right in everything. I had this in mind for a long 
time, but I persevered until I had taken my doctoral degree. This was an honor for the whole 
family. You yourself should not be too sad about it, for at least I have found a few traveling 
companions to accompany me to the grave. 
My experiences during my 28 years have caused me to adopt a rather jaundiced view of human existence; I have on occasion said to people that I would like to take orders as a Buddhist 
monk. There is no end to the hopes and desires in human life. In the U.S., even though 
there are no worries about food and clothing, up above there are still exalted, rich people, 
and compared with them I am poor as a church mouse. To sum up, on my own behalf I have 
vented my rage, and on behalf of my family I have provided a safeguard for their livelihood. 
What further expectations do I have to live for? Hence it has been said of old: “After a long 
drought to encounter the sweet rains, in a different place to meet an old friend, to burn the 
candle in one’s wedding chamber, and to see one’s name listed on the golden placard of successful examination candidates.” I have tasted all of these four great objects of a man’s life, 
and it can truly be said that I have known satisfaction!
Though I am single, I have had a few girlfriends. When I lived in the dormitory in high 
school I had already started to have girlfriends. When I went to college I often slipped into 
our old home at the Number 262 Hospital under cover of darkness and spent the night with girls. After I came to the States I had liaisons with Chinese and American women, with 
single and married women, with girls of good families and girls of the streets. I just don’t 
have a constant heart in these matters; the grass always looks greener somewhere else, and 
I can’t be satisfied with any particular person. Maybe I didn’t meet the right one, or perhaps 
I thought either that they were too good for me or I was too good for them. No matter what 
the answer is, I feel a bit fed up with male-female relationships. 
Moving on to another point I have already lost interest in physics, at which I labored for ten 
years (four in college and six years in graduate school); one could say I felt more and more 
that I had entered a dead-end street. The study of physics is more and more disappointing. 
The way it is now, one person says one thing, another says something else, and nobody 
really knows what’s going on. So people form a number of factions based around different 
universities, each side attacking the other while grandly touting their own views as correct. 
No wonder that there are people who say, “Modern physics is self-delusion.” I regret a bit 
that at the outset I did not study a more practical subject. But what can be done about it now? 
Our parents themselves were ignorant of these things and could not guide me in educational 
matters. I had to blunder on all by myself. Lots of Chinese physicists with U.S. citizenship, 
who had been messing around in the U.S. and weren’t happy any more, returned to China 
for visits and bragged that in doing so they were making a contribution to their fatherland. 
And so then the Chinese government started propagandizing on a grand scale and beguiled 
the young people in to studying the theoretical sciences. 
But, to get back to what I was saying earlier, if I had at the outset studied medicine, I could 
not possibly have come to the U.S. to study for a degree and earn American currency. Our 
parents did not have the economic resources to send me to the U.S. for advanced study. 
Some people at this school who are in the applied sciences, their parents are for the most 
part high-level intellectuals who have studied abroad. Their families have foreign currency, 
which they can use to enable their children to take the TOEFL and the GREs, and to defray 
their tuition and living expenses. Or they have relatives living abroad who can lend them 
money. That today I have come to this pass can justly be said to be partly the fault of our 
parents. I truly believe the saying, “In life be a paragon among men, and in death be a hero 
among the shades.” I take personal responsibility for all that I have done.
And another thing, in the end it would be best not to let the younger generation (of our 
family) know how it really was with me, for it might be disadvantageous to their futures. My 
beloved elder sister, I take my eternal leave of you. Your younger brother.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"I hate the fucking world, too much god damn fuckers in it. Too many thoughts and different 
societies all wrapped up together in this fucking place called AMERICA. Everyone has their 
own god damn opinions on every god damn thing and you may be saying â€œwell what makes 
you so different?â€ because I have something only me and V1 have, SELF AWARENESS. Call 
it existentialism or whatever the fuck you want. We know what we are to this world and 
what everyone else is. We learn more than what caused the civil war and how to simplify 
quadratics in school. We have been watching you people. We know what you think and how 
you act. All talk and no actions. People who are said to be brave or courageous are usually 
just STUPID. Then they say later that they did it on purpose cause they are brave when they 
did [it] on fucking accident. GOD everything is so corrupt and so filled with opinions and 
points of view and peopleâ€™s own little agendas and schedules. This isnâ€™t a world anymore. 
Itâ€™s HOE2 and no one knows it. Self awareness is a wonderful thing. I know I will die soon, so will you and everyone else. Maybe we will be 
lucky and a comet will smash us back to day 1. people say it is immoral to follow others, they 
say be a leader. Well here is a fuckin news flash for you stupid shits, everyone is a follower! 
Everyone who says they arenâ€™t followers and then dresses different or acts different . . . they 
got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality. How many Jo 
MAMMA jokes3 are there and how many do you think are original and not copied. KEINE 
[German: none]. Itâ€™s a fucking filthy place we live in. All these standards and laws and great 
expectations [?] are making people into robots even though they might â€œthinkâ€ they arenâ€™t 
and try to deny it. No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM! Except for this 
fucking piece of paper right here, and BTW [by the way] spelling is stupid unless I say, I say 
spell it how it sounds, itâ€™s the fuckin easiest way! Hey try this sometime, when someone 
tells you something, ask â€œwhy?â€ eventually they will be stumped and canâ€™t answer any more. 
Thatâ€™s because they only know what they need to know in society and school. Not real life 
science. They will end up saying words = to this â€œbecause! Just shut up!â€ People that only 
know stupid facts that arenâ€™t important should be shot, what fucking use are they. NATURAL 
SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who canâ€™t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on sav-
ing the lives of retards, and why. I donâ€™t buy that shit like â€œoh, heâ€™s my son, though!â€ so the 
fuck what, he ainâ€™t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time 
and money, then people say â€œbut he is worth the time, he is human too.â€ No he isnâ€™t, if he 
was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking [illegible] he was.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"As I said before, self-awareness is a wonderful thing. I know what all you fuckers are think-
ing and what to do to piss you off and make you feel bad. I always try to be different, but I 
always end up copying someone else. I try to be a mixture of different things and styles, but 
when I step out of myself I end up looking like others or others THINK I am copying. One 
big fucking problem is people telling me what to fuckin do, think, say, act, and everything 
else. Iâ€™ll do what you say IF I feel like it. But people (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling 
me what to [arrow to â€œdo, think, say, actâ€] makes me not want to fucking do it! Thatâ€™s why 
my fucking name is REB!!! No one is worthy of shit unless I say they are. I feel like God and 
I wish I was, having everyone being OFFICIALLY lower than me. I already know that I am 
higher than most anyone in the fucking welt [German: world] in terms of universal Intel-
ligence. And where we stand in the universe compared to the rest of the UNIVERSE. and if 
you think I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m talking about then you can just â€œBUCK DICHâ€ [German: 
bend over]4 and saugen mein hund [German: suck my dog]! Isnâ€™t America supposed to be the 
land of the free? How come, If Iâ€™m free, I canâ€™t deprive a stupid fucking dumbshit from his 
possessions if he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van out in plain sight 
and in the middle of fucking nowhere on a Frifuckingday night.5 NATURAL SELECTION. 
Fucker should be shot. Same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers 
think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born 
into it? Ich denk NEIN [German: I think not]. BTW [by the way], â€œsorryâ€ is just a word. It 
doesnâ€™t mean SHIT to me. Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only â€˜smartsâ€™ 
and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. 
If you canâ€™t figure out the area of a triangle or what â€œcationâ€ means, you die! If you canâ€™t 
take down a demon with a chainsaw or kill a hell prince with a shotgun, you die! Fucking 
snotty rich fuckheads   [apparently a name] who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to 
get them through life should be put to this challenge. Plus it would get rid of all the fat, 
retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world. No one is worthy 
of this planet, only me and who ever I choose, there is just no respect for anything higher 
than your fucking boss or parent. Everyone should be shot out into space and only those 
people I say should be left behind. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"Ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. Itâ€™s not too obvious 
to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should 
realize it. Its societyâ€™s way of turning all the young people into good little robots and factory 
workers. Thatâ€™s why we sit in desks in rows and go by bell schedules, to get prepared for the 
real world cause â€œthatâ€™s what its like.â€ Well god damn it no it isnâ€™t! one thing that separates 
us from other animals is the fact that we can carry actual thoughts. So why donâ€™t we? People 
go on day by day routine shit. Why canâ€™t we learn in school how we want to, why canâ€™t we sit 
on desks and on shelves and put our feet up and relax while we learn? Cause thatâ€™s not what 
the â€œreal world is like.â€ Well hey fuckheads, there is no such thing as an actual â€œreal world.â€ 
Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on. We are humans, 
if we donâ€™t like something we have the fucking ability to change! But we donâ€™t, at least you 
donâ€™t, I would. You just whine/bitch throughout life but never do a goddamn thing to change 
anything. â€œman can eat, drink, fuck, and hunt and anything else he does is madnessâ€ â€” Based 
on Lemâ€™s quote.6 Boy oh fuckin boy is that true. When I go NBK7 and people say things like, 
â€œoh, it was so tragic,â€ or â€œoh he is crazy!â€ or â€œIt was so bloody.â€ I think, so the fuck what you 
think thatâ€™s a bad thing? Just because your mumsy and dadsy told you blood and violence is 
bad, you think itâ€™s a fucking law of nature? Wrong. Only science and math are true, everything, 
and I mean everyfuckingthing else is Man made. My doctor wants to put me on medication8 
to stop thinking about so many things and to stop getting angry. Well, I think that anyone 
who doesnâ€™t think like me is just bullshitting themselves. Try it sometime if you think you 
are worthy, which you probably will you little shits, drop all your beliefs and views and ideas 
that have been burned into your head and try to think about why your here. But I bet most of 
you fuckers canâ€™t even think that deep, so that is why you must die. How dare you think that 
I and you are part of the same species when we are sooooooo different.9 You arenâ€™t human. 
You are a robot. You donâ€™t take advantage of your capabilities given to you at birth. You just 
drop them and hop onto the boat and head down the stream of life with all the other fuckers 
of your time. Well god damn it I wonâ€™t be part of it! I have thought too much, realized too 
much, found out too much, and I am too self aware to just stop what I am thinking and go 
back to society because what I do and think isnâ€™t â€œrightâ€ or â€œmorally accepted.â€ NO, NO, NO. 
God fucking damn it NO! I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. But before I leave 
this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life. And 
if you pissed me off in the past, you will die if I see you. Because you might be able to piss 
off others and have it eventually blow over, but not me. I donâ€™t forget people who wronged 
me, like  . He will never get a chance to read this because he will be dead by me before 
this is discovered.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"The human race sucks. Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. 
Instincts are deleted by laws. I see people say things that contradict themselves, or people that 
donâ€™t take any advantage to the gift of human life. They waste their minds on memorizing 
the stats of every college basketball player or how many words should be in a report when 
they should be using their brain on more important things. The human race isnâ€™t worth fighting for anymore. WWII was the last war worth fighting and was the last time human life and human brains did any good 
and made us proud. Now, with the government having scandals and conspiracies all over 
the fucking place and lying to everyone all the time and with worthless, pointless, mind-
less, disgraceful TV shows on and with everyone ob-fucking-sessed with Hollywood and 
beauty and fame and glamour and politics and anything famous, people just arenâ€™t worth 
saving. Society may not realize what is happening but I have; you go to school, to get used 
to studying and learning how your â€œsupposed toâ€ so that drains or filters out a little bit of 
human nature. But thatâ€™s after your parents taught you whatâ€™s right and wrong even though 
you may think differently, you still must follow the rules. After school you are expected to 
get a job or go to college. To have more of your human nature blown out your ass. Society 
tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. Thatâ€™s what 
schools, laws, jobs, and parents do. If they realize it or not. And them, the few who stick to 
their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain differ-
ent. crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading. If humans were let to 
live how we would naturally, it would be chaos and anarchy and the human race wouldnâ€™t 
probably last that long, but hey guess what, thatâ€™s how itâ€™s supposed to be!!!!! Societies and 
government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of 
pure human nature. Take away all your laws and morals and just see what you can do if the 
governments in our own little so called self-created â€œcivilized worldâ€ and get rid of all those 
damn [or Darwin?] instincts everyone has!! Bullshit. Iâ€™m too tired to write anymore tonight, 
so until next time, fuck you all. It has been confirmed, after getting my yearbook10 and watching people like   and the human race isnâ€™t worth fighting for, only worth killing. Give the Earth back to the ani-
mals, they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore, most 
quotes are worthless, especially the rearranged ones like â€œdonâ€™t fight your enemies, make 
your enemies fight.â€ You know, quotes that use the same phrase just rearranged, Dumb 
fuck shit [illegible] itâ€™s funny, people say â€œyou shouldnâ€™t be so differentâ€ to me, and 1st I say 
fuck you donâ€™t tell me what I should and shouldnâ€™t be and 2nd mother fuckers different is 
good, I donâ€™t want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible this day with all the 
little shits trying to be â€œoriginal copycatsâ€, I expect shits like you to criticize anyone who isnâ€™t 
one your social words, â€œnormalâ€ or â€œcivilizedâ€ â€” see: Tempest and Caliban. All you degrading 
worthless shits all caught up and brainwashed into the 90â€™s society. â€œwhat? You ARENâ€™T 
going to college, are you crazy!â€ holy SHIT that is one fucking BIG quote that just proves 
my point. Step back and look at yourself fuckers, I dare you, maybe Iâ€™ll get lucky and youâ€™ll 
step back to far like Nick in E1M311 with the same consequence.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"Wooh, different pen. HA! All right you pathetic fools listen up; I have figured it out. The hu-
man race strives for excellence in life and community always wanting to bring more good
into the community. And nullify â€œbadâ€ things. Anyone who thinks differently than the majority 
or the leaders is deemed â€œunusualâ€ or weird or crazy. People want to be a part of something, 
a family, a service, a club, a union, a community, whatever. Thatâ€™s what humans want. Who 
cares what you as an individual thinks, you must do what you are told, whether it is jump off 
a bridge or drive on the right side of the road. Protesters in the past protested because the 
human race that was dominant (Ghandhi and the Brits or the king or the Americans) wasnâ€™t 
working out = they had fault = they failed = their ideas didnâ€™t work. Humans donâ€™t change 
that much, they only get better technology to do their work quicker/easier. People always say 
we shouldnâ€™t be racist. Why not? Blacks ARE different. Like it or not they are. They started 
out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they 
are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we 
are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came 
from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays. . . . well all 
gays, ALL gays, should be killed. without questions. Lesbians are 
fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. Itâ€™s a fucking disease. You donâ€™t see 
bulls or roosters trying to fuck, do you? No, I didnâ€™t think so. Women, you will always be under men. Itâ€™s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women 
stay back. Itâ€™s your animal instincts, deal with it or commit suicide, just do it quick. Thatâ€™s 
all for now. If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a â€œfinal solutionâ€ to the Jewish problem. Kill 
them all. Well, in case you havenâ€™t figured it out yet, I say â€œKILL MANKINDâ€ no one should 
survive. We all live in lies [?]. People are always saying they want to live in a perfect society, 
well utopia doesnâ€™t exist. It is human to have flaws. You know what. Fuck it. Why should 
I have to explain myself to you survivors when half of this shit I say you shitheads wonâ€™t 
understand and if you can then woopie fucking do. That just means you have something 
to say as my reason for killing. And the majority of the audience wonâ€™t even understand my 
motives either! Theyâ€™ll say â€œah, heâ€™s crazy, heâ€™s insane, worthless! All you fuckers should die! 
DIE! What the fuck is the point if only some people see what I am saying, there will always 
be ones who donâ€™t, ones that are to dumb or naÃ¯ve or ignorant or just plain retarded. If I 
canâ€™t pound it into every single persons head then it is pointless. Fuck money fuck justice 
fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws . . . DIE manmade words . . . people think 
they apply to everything when they donâ€™t/canâ€™t. Thereâ€™s no such thing as True Good or True 
evil, itâ€™s all relative to the observer. Itâ€™s just all nature, chemistry, and math. Deal with it. But 
since dealing with it seems impossible for mankind, since we have to slap warning labels 
on nature, then . . . you die, burn, melt, evaporate, decay. Just go the fuck away. YAAAAAA!!!

EricHarris,Journal,"Hereâ€™s something to chew on . . . today I saw a program on the discovery channel about 
satellites and radar and aircraft and stuff, and at the end of the show the narrator said some 
things that made me think â€œdamn, we are so advanced, we kick ass, America is awesome, we have so many things in our military, we would kick anyoneâ€™s ass.â€ For a minute I actually 
had some pride in our nation . . . then I realized, â€œhey, this is only the GOOD things that I 
am seeing here. Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe thatâ€™s what people see, only the pros, 
and thatâ€™s why they are under control, but me, I see all . . . you can only blind me for so long, 
but alas, I have realized that Yes, the human race is still indeed doomed. It just needs a few 
kick starts, like me, and hell, maybe even  . If I can wipe a few cities off the map, and 
even the fuckhead holding the map, then great. Hmm, just thinking if I want all humans 
dead or maybe just the quote-unquote â€œcivilized, developed, and known-ofâ€ places on Earth, 
maybe leave little tribes of natives in the rain forest or something. Hmm, Iâ€™ll think about 
that. Eh, done for tonight. As part of the human race, and having the great pleasure of being blessed with a brain, I can think. Humans can do whatever they want. There is no laws of nature that prevent 
humans from making choices. Maybe from actually DOING some of those choices, but not 
from making the choice. If a man chooses to speed while driving home one day then it is 
his fault for whatever happens. If he crashes into a school bus full of kiddies and they all 
burn to death, itâ€™s his fault. Itâ€™s only a tragedy if you think it is, and then itâ€™s only a tragedy 
in your own mind so you shouldnâ€™t expect others to think that way also. It could also be a 
miracle for another person maybe that bus stopped the car from plowing into a little old 
lady walking on the sidewalk, one could think it was a â€œmiracleâ€ that she wasnâ€™t hit. You see, 
anything and everything that happens in our world is just that, a HAPPENING. Anything 
else is relative to the observer, but yet we try to have a â€œuniversal lawâ€ or â€œcodeâ€ of what is 
good and bad and that just isnâ€™t fuckin correct. We shouldnâ€™t be allowed to do that. We arenâ€™t 
GODS, just because we are at the top of the food chain with our technology doesnâ€™t mean 
we can be â€œjudgesâ€ of nature. Sure we can think what we want, but you can â€œthinkâ€ and â€œbehaveâ€ you can judge people and nature all you want, but you are still wrong! Why should your morals apply to 
everyone else. â€œMoralsâ€ is just another word, and thatâ€™s it. I think we are all a waste of natural 
resources and should be killed off, and since humans have the ability to choose . . . and Iâ€™m 
human . . . I think I will choose to kill and damage as much as nature allows me to so take 
that, fuck you, and eat napalm + lead! HA! Only nature can stop me. I know I could get shot 
by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that 
one person so get over it! Itâ€™s MY fault! Not my parents, not my brothers, not my friends, not 
my favorite bands, not computer games, not the media. IT is MINE! Go shut the fuck up!",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"Someoneâ€™s bound to say â€œwhat were they thinking?â€ when we go NBK or when we were 
planning it, so this is what I am thinking. â€œI have a goal to destroy as much as possible so 
I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy, mercy, or any of that, so I will force 
myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom like FH [Former Human, 
mob in Doom] or FS [Former Sergeant] or demons, so itâ€™s either me or them. I have to turn 
off my feelings.â€ Keep this in mind, I want to burn the world, I want to kill everyone except 
about 5 people, who I will name later, so if you are reading this you are lucky you escaped 
my rampage because I wanted to kill you. It will be very tricky getting all of our supplies, 
explosives, weaponry, ammo, and then hiding it all and then actually planting it all so we 
can achieve our goal. But if we get busted any time, we start killing then and there, just like 
Wilks from the ALIENS books [comic books], I ainâ€™t going out without a fight.  Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max 
in the school alone who I donâ€™t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE! If I didnâ€™t like 
you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god 
damn NIGGER. Pity that a lot of the dead will be a waste in some ways, like dead hot chicks 
who were still bitches, they could have been good fucks. Oh well, too fucking bad. Life isnâ€™t 
fair. . . . not by a long fuckin shot when Iâ€™m at the wheel, too. God I want to torch and level 
everything in this whole fucking area but bombs of that size are hard to make, and plus I 
would need a fuckin fully loaded A-10 to get every store on Wadsworth and all the buildings 
downtown. Heh, imagine THAT you fuckers, picture half of Denver on fire just from me 
and Vodka. Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car garages blowing up from exploded gas 
tanks. . . . oh man that would be beautiful. You know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I donâ€™t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Letâ€™s see, what are some big lies I have told; â€œyeah 
I stopped smoking;â€ â€œfor doing it not for getting caught,â€ â€œno I havenâ€™t been making more 
bombs,â€ â€œno I wouldnâ€™t do that,â€ and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know 
that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. Itâ€™s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one 
else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would 
shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, 
unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. 
Some people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could 
nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people 
I wouldnâ€™t want to die, but hey, who ever said life is fair should be shot like the others, too.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"I sure had fun this weekend. Letâ€™s see, what really happened. Before going to 
Rock-n-Bowl we stopped by King Soopers and me and   picked up some big ass stogies. 
We then went to Rock-n-Bowl and I had a few cigarettes and one of my brand new cigars. 
We then went back to  â€™s house where her mom had previously bought us all a fuck 
load of liquor. Personally I had asked for Tequila and Irish cream, Vodka got his Vodka, and 
there was beer, whiskey, schnapps, puckers, scotch, and of course, orange juice! So we had 
some fun there playing cards and making drinks. We eventually made it to bed at about 5 
AM. Got up at 10, went to Safeway got some doughnuts and then I took Vodka home. The 
bottle of Tequila is almost full and is in my car right by my spare tire and right by the bottle 
of Irish Cream. Heh heh. Iâ€™ll have to find a spot for those. And by the way, this Nazi report13 
is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a 
sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. Thatâ€™s 
how Nazism was formed, and thatâ€™s how I will be too! Fuck you Brady!14 All I want is a couple of guns, and thanks to your fucking bill I will probably not get any! Come on, Iâ€™ll have a clean record and I only want them for personal protection. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m some psycho who would go on a shooting spree. . . . fuckers. Iâ€™ll 
probably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collectorâ€™s house. Fuck, 
thatâ€™ll be hard. Oh well, just as long as I kill a lot of fucking people. Everyone is always 
making fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get 
you all back, ultimate fucking revenge here.15 You people could have shown more respect, 
treated me better, asked for my knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior, 
and maybe I wouldnâ€™t have been so ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have 
always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even 
thinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. Thatâ€™s where a lot of my hate grows 
from. The fact that I have practically no self-esteem, especially concerning girls and looks 
and such. Therefore people make fun of me . . . constantly . . . therefore I get no respect and 
therefore I get fucking PISSED. As of this date I have enough explosions to kill about 100 
people, and then if I get a couple bayonets, swords, axes, whatever Iâ€™ll be able to kill at least 
10 more. And that just isnâ€™t enough! Guns! I need guns! Give me some fucking firearms!",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"HATE! Iâ€™m full of hate and I love it. I HATE PEOPLE and they better fucking fear me if they 
know whatâ€™s good for â€™em. Yes I hate and I guess I want others to know it, yes Iâ€™m a racist 
and I donâ€™t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very 
racist towards white trash P.O.S.â€™s [piece of shits] like   and   they deserve the hatred, 
otherwise I probably wouldnâ€™t hate them. Itâ€™s a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead 
to their downfall. Peopleâ€™s human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, itâ€™s 
happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Min-
nesota who squealed.16 Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are 
and why and I canâ€™t stand it! I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking canâ€™t get enough 
of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times 
and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what 
they wanted. I know that form of government couldnâ€™t have lasted long once the human 
equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good. Every form of government leads 
to downfalls, everything will always fuck up or yeah something. Itâ€™s all doomed, god damn 
it. This is beginning to make me get in a corner. Iâ€™m showing too much of myself, my views 
and thoughts, people might start to wonder, smart ones will get nosy and something might 
happen to fuck me over, I might need to put on one helluva mask here to fool you all some 
more. Fuck fuck fuck. Itâ€™ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give 
me more compliments all of this might still be avoidable . . . but probably not. Whatever I 
do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. Iâ€™ll get revenge soon enough. 
Fuckers shouldnâ€™t have ripped on me so much huh!17 Ha! Then again itâ€™s human nature 
to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I canâ€™t take it, itâ€™s not 
right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be 
fucking great if it werenâ€™t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You 
know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe thatâ€™ll just change some shit around. Thatâ€™s 
another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them 
hard and strong. Someone like   where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off

someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to 
stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their 
rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show

Well folks, today was a very important day in the history of Reb today, along with Vodka and 
someone else who I wonâ€™t name,21 we went downtown and purchased the following: a double 
barrel 12 ga. Shotgun, a pump action 12 ga. Shotgun, a 9mm carbine, 250 9mm rounds, 
15 12 ga slugs, 40 shotgun shells, 2 switch blade knives, and a total of 4 10-round clips for 
the carbine. We . . . . . . . . have . . . . . . GUNS! we fucking got them you sons of bitches! HA! 
HA HA HA! Neener! Booga Booga. Heh. Itâ€™s all over now. This capped it off, the point of no 
return. I have my carbine, shotgun, ammo and knife all in my trunk tonight and theyâ€™ll stay 
there till tomorrow . . . after school you know, its really a shame. I had a lot of fun at that gun 
show, I would have loved it if you were there Dad. We would have done some major bonding. 
Would have been great. Oh well. But alas, I fucked up and told   about my flask. that 
really disappointed me  . I know you thought it was good for me in the long run and all 
that shit, smart of you to give me such a big raise and then rat me out.22 You figure it was 
supposed to cancel each other? God damn flask, that just fucked me over bigtime. Now you 
all will be on my ass even more than before about being on track. Iâ€™ll get around it though. If I have to cheat and lie to everyone than thatâ€™s fine. THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS 
is my goal. THIS is what I want â€œto do with my life.â€ You know whatâ€™s weird, I donâ€™t feel like 
punching through a door because of the flask deal, probably cause 
I am fucking armed. I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like. I have confidence in 
my ability to deceive people, hopefully Iâ€™ll make it to April, but that might not happen. Ug, 
its been a busy weekend, I need to sleep, Iâ€™ll continue tomorrow.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"Yesterday we fired our first firearms ever. 3 rounds from the carbine. Taught that ground a 
thing or 2. I even had the 2 clips in my pocket while talking to Vodkaâ€™s dad about senior ditch 
day. God it felt great firing off that bad boy, and hopefully Iâ€™ll be able to get more than just 
4 clips for it. I dubbed my shotgun â€œArleneâ€ after Arlene Sanders from the DOOM books. 
She always did love the shotgun. Vodkaâ€™s OB [?] is looking fucking awesome, all cut down 
to the proper lengths. This is a bitch trying to keep up with homework while working on 
my guns, bombs, and lying. By the way, I bought that flask in the mall and I had a friend 
fill it up with scotch whiskey, only had about 3 swigs in the 3 weeks I had it. Plus Monday 
I gave my T and IC [tequila and Irish cream] to Vodka, just in case. I never really did like 
alcohol, just wasnâ€™t my thing, but it felt good to just have around. That argument on the 
22nd was a real bitch, but I think I should have won a fucking Oscar. I even quoted a few 
movies, remember â€œwhat the hell am I gonna do now man?! What am I gonna do!?â€ thatâ€™s 
good ole Hudson from â€œAliens.â€ Sounded good too. And hey god damn it I would have been 
a fucking great marine. It would have give me a reason to do good. And I would never drink 
and drive, either. It will be weird when we actually go on the rampage. Hopefully we will 
have plenty of clips and bombs. Iâ€™m gonna still try and get my calico 9mm. Just think, 100 
rounds without reloading. . . . hell yeah!
We actually may have a chance to get some machine pistols thanks to the Brady bill. If we 
can save up about $200 real quick and find someone who is 21+ we can go to the next gun 
show and find a private dealer and buy ourselves some bad-ass AB-10 machine pistols. Clips 
for those things can get really fucking bit too. woohoo, Iâ€™ll never have to take a final again! Feels good to be free. I just love Hobbes and Nietzsche. Well tomorrow Iâ€™ll be ordering 9 more 10-round clips for my carbine. Iâ€™m gonna be so fucking loaded in about a month. The big things we need to figure out now is the time 
bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without 
any fuckin Jews finding them. I wonder if anyone will write a book on me. Sure is a ton of 
symbolism, double meanings, themes, appearance vs. reality shit going on here. Oh well, it 
better be fuckin good if it is written. Heh, get this. KMFDMâ€™s new albumâ€™s entitled â€œAdiosâ€ and its release date is in April. How fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final â€œAdiosâ€ tribute to Reb and Vodka, thanks KMFDM . . . 
I ripped the hell outa the system.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EricHarris,Journal,"Jesus christ that was fucking close. Fucking shitheads at the gunshop almost dropped the 
whole project.24 Oh well, thank god I can BS so fucking well. I went and picked up those 
babies today, so now I got 13 of those niggers woohah. The stereo is very nice, but having 
no insurance payments to worry about so I could concentrate of BOMBS would have been 
better. Oh well, I think Iâ€™ll have enough. Now I just need to get Vodka another gun. Months have passed. Itâ€™s the first Friday night in the final month. Much shit has happened. Vodka has a Tec 9, we test fired all of our babies, we have 6 time clocks ready, 39 crickets [small bombs] 24 pipe bombs, and the napalm is under construction. Right now Iâ€™m trying to get fucked and trying to finish off these time bombs. NBK came quick, why the fuck canâ€™t I get any? I mean, Iâ€™m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try too 
hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in. The amount of dramatic irony 
and foreshadowing is fucking amazing. Everything I see and hear I incorporate into NBK 
somehow. Either bombs, clocks, guns, napalm, killing people, any and everything finds 
some tie to it. Feels like a goddamn movie sometimes. I wanna try to put some mines and 
trip bombs around this town too maybe. Get a few extra kills on the scoreboard. I hate 
you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no donâ€™t fucking say â€œwell thatâ€™s 
your faultâ€ because it isnâ€™t, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. no no

I confronted him in the kitchen on that same night, telling him that he is foolish to feel proud about having an ugly whore in his room. This made him angry a nd offended, which is what I wanted. I wanted \nto offend him as punishment for his insolence. After that incident, the two of us became more and more hostile towards each other.  \n      In the beginning of February, my Spring semester at Santa Barbara City Co llege began. The classes I \nregis tered for were Sociology, Math, Film Studies, and English. My English class was an online class, but \nthe other three were normal classes that I attended at the college. Sociology and math were on \nTuesdays and Thursdays, and my film class was on Friday mornings. It made for a convenient setup.  \n     This was the last chance. I had already failed to change my life in the last semester. I must not fail \nagain. I remembered how hard it was to keep up those two classes in the Autum n. The people in them \nmade me feel so miserable. I knew that if the same thing happens in the coming semester, I would end \nup dropping all of my classes, and if that happ ened, all of my hope would be doomed.  \n     On the morning of the first day , I donned m y fabulous  Armani Exchange shirt and put on my new \nGucci sunglasses that my mother gave me. I admired myself in the mirror for a few moments, and began to feel a surge of enthusiasm. I wanted everyone to see me looking like that. I was hopeful that some girls would admire me. I said to myself that there was no way I could possibly have trouble with getting \ngirls now. I stopped by at Starbucks to buy a latte and set off for my college with the confidence that I \nwould appear as a superior gentleman to all of the students there. I was a superior gentleman. That was  \nwhat I was born to be , and it was now time to show it to the world.  \n     It was a bright, sunny day as I as ascended the familiar steps up to the beautiful college campus of \nSBCC. I immediately went to the restroom to look at myself in the mirror a few times, just so that I can \nfeel more assured of myself. Yes, I thought. I am the image of beauty ad supremacy.  I kept saying it over \nand over again, as if it was a mantra. When I crossed the renowned bridge that connected the two halves of the campus, I felt as if everyone was admiring me. As I passed by groups of girls, I pre tended to \nimagine that they secretly adored and wanted me. After all, that was how it was meant  to be. The more \nI walked around the campus, the more I tried to convince myself that that was the case.  \n     My first class was sociology, and I waited until e veryone was seated before I walked in. I came in \nthrough the front entrance so that everyone could look at my fabulous self. To my utter dismay, I saw \nthat no one turned their head to look at me at all. No girl tilted a head or lifted a pretty little eyebr ow at \nmy approach. After all that effort, I was still being treated like I was invisible.  \n[99]     The sociology class flew by like a breeze, and my next class was math.

these realities are fake â€” artificial, induced [?] by thought, how everything connects, yet its 
all so far apart. . . . & I sit & think . . . science is the way to find solutions to everything, right? 
I still think that, yet I see different views of shit now â€” like the mind â€” yet if the mind is 
viewed scientifically . . . hmm
I dwell in the past . . . thinking of good & bad memories A lot on the past though . . . Iâ€™ve always had a thing for the past â€” how it reacts to the pres-
ent & the future â€” or rather vice versa. I wonder how/when I got so fucked up w my mind, 
existence, problem â€” when Dylan Benet2 Klebold got covered up by this entity containing 
Dylanâ€™s body . . . as I see the people at school â€” some good, some bad â€” I see how different I 
am (arenâ€™t we all youâ€™ll say) yet Iâ€™m on such a greater scale of difference than everyone else 
(as far as I know, or guess). I see jocks having fun, friends, women, LIVEZ.
Or rather shallow existences compared to mine (maybe) like ignorance = bliss. They donâ€™t

Existence. . . . what a strange word. He set out by determination & curiosity, knows no ex-

on this world, in this world, he knows the answers to. Yet they have no purpose to him. He 
seeks knowledge of the unthinkable, of the undefineable, of the unknown. He explores the 
everything5 . . . using his mind, the most powerful tool known to him. Not a physical barrier 
blocking the limits of exploration, time thru thought thru dimensions . . . the everything is 
his realm. Yet, the more he thinks, hoping to find answers to his questions, the more come 
up. Amazingly, the petty things mean much to him at this time, how he wants to be normal, 
not this transceiver of the everything. Then occurring to him, the answer. How everything is 
connected yet separate. By experiencing the petty others actions, reactions, emotions, doings, 
and thoughts, he gets a mental picture of what, in his mind, is a cycle. 
Existence is a great hall, life is one of the rooms, death is passing thru the doors, & the ever-
existent compulsion of everything is the curiosity to keep moving down the hall, thru the 
doors, exploring rooms, down this never-ending hall. Questions make answers, answers 
conceive questions, and at long last he is content.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within the known limits of time . . . within the conceived boundaries of space . . . the aver-

believer, helps out the human. â€œThink not of 2 dimensions,â€ says the ponderer, â€œbut of 3, 
as your world is conceived of 3 dimensions, so is mine. While you explore the immediate 
physical boundaries of your body, you see in your 3 dimensions â€” L, W, & H, yet I, who is 
more mentally open to anything, see my 3 dimensions. My realm of thought â€” Time, Space, 
& THOUGHT.  Thought is the most powerful thing that exists â€” anything conceivable can 
be produced, anything & everything is possible, even in your physical world.â€ After this so 
called â€œlectureâ€ the common man feels confused, empty, & unaware. Yet those are the best 
emotions of a ponderer. The real difference is, a true ponderer will explore these emotions 
& what caused them.
Another . . . a dream.
Miles & miles of never ending grass, like a wheat. A farm, sunshine, a happy feeling in the

see it as a battle they can win. HA fuckin morons. If people looked at History, they would 
see what happens. I think, too much, I understand, I am GOD compared to some of those 
un-existable brainless zombies. Yet, the actions of them interest me, like a kid with a new 
toy. Another contrast, more of a paradox, actually, like the advanced go for the undevelopeds

rule, & this is a BIG exception â€” most morons never change, they never decide to live in the

well I finally found someone who was like me: who appreciated me & shared very common 
interests. Ever since 7th grade, Iâ€™ve felt lonely . . . when   came around, I finally felt hap-

Existence . . . to understand
Well well . . . so much changes . . . (like existence). I understand almost everything now . . . 
so close to my love â€”  . The runes have shown it, she has shown it, I have felt it. I know 
the meaning of each life: to be loved by your love, & to be happy with ones self. Only for the 
gods though (me,  , etc.). the zombies & their society band together & try to destroy what 
is superior13 (what they donâ€™t understand & are afraid of. Soon. . . . either Iâ€™ll commit suicide, 
or Iâ€™ll get with   & it will be NBK14 for us. My happiness. Her happiness. NOTHING else 
matters. Iâ€™ve been caught with most of my crimes â€” xpl [for example] drinking, smoking & 
the house vandalism, & the pipe bombs. If, by fateâ€™s choice,   didnâ€™t love me, Iâ€™d slit my 
wrist & blow up Atlanta15 strapped to my neck. Itâ€™s good, understanding a hard road since 
my realization, but it gets easier. BUT IT DOESNâ€™T! thatâ€™s part of existence. Unpredictable. 
Existence is pure hell & pure heaven at the same time. I will never stop wondering. The lost 
highway will never end, the music in my head will never stop . . . total [?] part of existence. The 
hall will never end. The love will always be there. GOD I LOVE HER!!! Itâ€™s so great to love. Society is tightening its grip on me, & soon I &   will snap. We will have our revenge on 
society, & then be free, to exist in a timeless spaceless place of pure happiness. The purpose of 
life is to be happy & be with your love who is equally happy. Not much more to say. Goodbye.
Almost happiness is slavery â€” the real people (gods) are slaves to the majority of zombies, 
but we know & love being superior.
I didnâ€™t want to be a jock. I hated the happiness that they have â€” & I will have something 
infinitely better.
I love her & she loves me.
(By the way, some zombies are smarter than others, some manipulate . . . like my parents.)
I am GOD,   is GOD
the zombies will pay for their arrogance, hate, fear, abandoned, & distrust I love you   thatâ€™s all I think about anymore . . . I know that this humanity is almost over, 
that we will be free. We have proven to fate that we are the everything of purity & halcyon, 
& that we deserve, need, love, canâ€™t exist without each other. Itâ€™s hard, I think that I might 
not be enough, my mind sometimes gets stuck on its own things, I think about human 
things â€” all I try to do is imagine the happiness between us. That is something we cannot even conceive in this toilet earth. The everything, the halcyon, the happiness is ours, there 
will be no notes from me. Let the humans suffer without my knowledge of the everything. 
I am trying not to think about the happiness, somehow thinking that  16 will destroy it if I 
conceive/relish in it when Iâ€™m a human, but I love her. We are soulmates.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You donâ€™t consciously know who I am (please donâ€™t skip to the back: read the note as it was 
written), & doubtedly unconsciously too. I, who write this, love you beyond infinince. I think 
about you all the time, how this world would be a better place if you loved me as I do you. 
I know what youâ€™re thinking: â€œ(some psycho wrote me this harassing letter)â€ I hoped we 
could have been together . . . you seem a bit like me. Pensive, quiet, an observer, not wanting 
what is offered here (school, life, etc.) you almost seem lonely, like me. You probably have a 
boyfriend though, & might not have given this note another thought. I have thought you my 
true love for a long time now, but . . . well . . . there was hesitation. You see I canâ€™t tell if you 
think of anyone as I do you, & if you did who that would be. Fate put me in need of you, yet 
this earth blocked that with uncertainties. I will go away soon, but I just had to write this to 
you, the one I truly loved. Please, for my sake, donâ€™t tell anybody about this, as it was only 
meant for you. Also, please donâ€™t feel any guilt about my soon-to-be â€œabsenceâ€ of this world 
(it is solely my decision: no one elseâ€™s) oh . . . the thoughts of us . . . doing everything together, 
not necessarily anything, just to be together would have been pure heaven. I guess itâ€™s time 
to tell you who I am. I was in a class with you 1st semester, & was blessed with being with 
you in a report. I still remember your laugh. Innocent, beautiful, pure. This semester I still 
see you â€” rarely. I am entranced during 5th period, as we both have it off. To most people, I appear . . . well . . . almost scary, 
but thatâ€™s who I appear to be as people are afraid of what they donâ€™t understand. I denied 
who I was for a long time. Until high school. . . . anyway, you have noticed me a few times, I 
catch every one of these gazes with an open heart. I think you know who I am by now. Un-
fortunately . . . even if you did like me even the slightest bit, you would hate me if you knew 
who I was. I am a criminal. I have done things that almost nobody would even think about 
condoning. The reason that Iâ€™m writing you now is that I have been caught for the crimes I 
committed, & I want to go to a new existence. You know what I mean (suicide). I have noth-
ing to live for, & I wont be able to survive in this world after this legal conviction. However, 
if it was true that you loved me as I do you . . . I would find a way to survive. Anything to be 
with you. I would enjoy life knowing that you loved me. 99/100 chances you probably think 
Iâ€™m crazy, & want to stay as far away as possible. If thatâ€™s the case, then Iâ€™m very sorry for 
involving an innocent person in my problems, & please donâ€™t think twice. However, if you are 
who I hoped for in my dreams & realities, then do me a favor: leave a piece of paper in my 
locker saying anything that comes to you. Well, I guess this is it â€” goodbye, & I love(d) you.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

that I can never ever be a zombie, even if I wanted to. The nature of my entity. Soon we will

when our existence started, it should end the same way, with us unknowing, in limbo. I 
love you  . Always have, will. The scenarios, images, pieces of happiness still come. they 
always will. I love her she loves me. I know she is tired of suffering as I am. It is time. It is

nothing without her. â€“O. my humanity, â€“O. I donâ€™t know if I should call her, or wait for   
to act. Yet, calling her is a state of humanity. Iâ€™m forever sorry, infinitely, about the pornos.

is the way to break free. I hate this. The happiness is close visible ending, end of the beginning of the halcyons.
The humanity is blocking me again. Time to go. HAHAHAHA fuck all. Hate this shit, need 
to be me, love her. The framework of society stands above & below me. The hardest thing to destroy, yet the 
weakest thing that exists. I know that I am different, yet I am afraid to tell the society. The 
possible abandonment, persecution is not something I want to face, yet it is so primitive to 
me. I guess being yourself means letting people know about inner thoughts too, not just 
opinions & fashions. I will be free one day, in the land of purity

we know & use. An understanding of the everything. An Einstein stuck in an antâ€™s body.

What fun is life without a little death?

touch of triviality to it. Like how none of this calculus shit matters. The way it shouldnâ€™t. 
the truth. In 26.4 hours, Iâ€™ll be dead, & in happiness. The little zombie human fags will 
know their errors, & be forever suffering and mournful. HAHAHAH, of course I will miss

AlvaroCastillo,Journal,"Dear Journal, I am going to do it! I have been thinking about this moment since the 10th grade. I am going to buy a shotgun and I am going to commit suicide. I brought some audio cassette tapes so I can explain to the police and my parents about why I did it. i plan to commit suicide on either april 20th or april 21st. april 20th is an obvious choice, for it is the seventh anniversary of the columbine high school massacre. however, i want to see the documentaries that they will show on the history channel. if is there, then i will wait until he leaves. then i will ocmmit the act. i will send anna an email telling her how much i love and care for her. i will tell her that i would pass by her house, and that i named my shotgun after her and the m-16 rifle in basic training. i will also call and confess to him what i will do. i have to do this. ever since that . alvaro catillo rest in peace born died cause of death self inflicted gunshot to the head via entrance to the  dear journal, well i gave arlene a complete makeover. i turned her into eric's shotgun. i sawed off the barrel and stock of the shotgun with a hacksaw. it took a lot less time than i thought it would. i taped the butt of the shotgun with duct tape. now i just have to test her. i also took bomb apart, and i know how to make more. i must reserve the motel for denver today. arlene looks so beautiful now. i also ordered a pistol belt and three ammuniition pouches from the internet. everything's falling into place at last. today i also saw a program on the history channel about charles whitman, the texas sniper. he was an ex marine who killed his wife, mother, and a number of other people on august 1, 1966. this year will mark the 40th anniversary. i will buy black cargo pants and black boots online to complete the uniform that eric was wearing on april 20th 1999. i am feeling very depressed these days. i drown my sadness and depression with work, cleaning, and movies. still it just keeps coming back, i am a tv junkie. i have been addicted to movies and television ever since i was born. i just became interested in rated r movies when i was 7 years old, around the same time i was shown pornography. i am having sexual fantasies these days and fantasies of being held  hostage by an evili twin brother. i assume that he represents my dark side. i can't even cry! the anti depressant i am taking doesn't seem to be working. on august 29th my depression will end permanently. i just want to die i don't want to live like this anymore. i have endured 10 years . in one week i will finally be dead. i am just putting the finishing touches on my autobiography it is in my computer in microsoft word  under the name columbine. i have almost everything ready. i just need more ammo and i need to go to church before i begin. i cannot wait. i wish i could tell my family but i can't. i miss anna. today she starts her sophomore year. i will always think about her. she is so beautiful. i don't deserve her though. i do not deserve anyone. if i was mentally well, maybe i could've told her my feelings. i do not feel sorry for scaring her. i know i am sick. what do you do with sick people like me. can't change you have to sacrifice the,. bad things could happen. we have to learn to sacrifice ourselves. i need to sleep now. goodnight. today is the big day for operation columbine. it is time that the world be reminded of columbine. i will die today. i just killed my father. it felt good. he is finally dead. i do feel a little remorse. still he is finally with god and tony. i loved my father, i hesitated but i finally did it. god be with him.

AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"I didnâ€™t understand this when I was younger, but Iâ€™ve always had an immense hatred for 
culture. I consider culture to be delusional values which humans mindlessly coerce onto 
each other, spreading it no differently than any other disease. I previously sought to eliminate 
my cultural values to the greatest extent that I could. Through this I expected to gradually 
discover values of an inner self which could be reconciled with this society, so that I could 
engage in activities and pursue goals which would lead to happiness.
Eventually I got to a point where I had sufficiently freed myself from what I called â€œcultural 
valuesâ€ when I analyzed all of the things which brought me happiness and all the goals which 
I wanted to pursue, I realized that absolutely everything about those things that appealed to 
me was entirely a consequence of my cultural infection.
Formerly, I had rejected some aspects of culture while accepting other ones, and merely 
not calling them cultural as if those values were somehow transcendent and fine. It was at 
that point that I realized that there is no such thing as an inner self. Any sense of self is a 
delusional cultural construct. I realized that cultural infections were the sole source of any 
possible value beyond base values. For a while, I believed that happiness could be attained if culture could theoretically be eradicated and anarchic primitivism were to take 
hold. Replace all instances of technology with culture in the analytic sections of Industrial 
Society and Its Future and you basically have my mentality at the time regarding the pernicious effects of culture.
The problem was that Iâ€™d not been addressing what happiness is. Happiness is merely the 
fulfilment of value, I recognized that if cultural values were eliminated, the happiness which 
results from their fulfilment would not be needed because happiness becomes an unnecessary and incoherent concept when it is removed from its concept â€” context. A common 
theme in my quasi-anarcho-primitivist thought at the time is that non-base values exist only 
as a consequence of cultural infections and impede on the happiness which results from 
the fulfilment of feral values. As if my feral self is â€” in short metaphysically the real 
me, whose soul had been devoured by the culturally constructed impostor of the self. But 
my feral self was also an impostor. Just as I realized that I could eliminate non-base values 
and have no need for the happiness which resulted from their fulfilment, I could eliminate 
base-values and have no need for the happiness which resulted from their fulfilment.
It was not only the disease of culture that had been plaguing me all â€” all along, it was the 
disease of life itself. I was not and I am not in some existential crisis, Iâ€™ve never had 
the slightest problem with the obvious nonexistence of free will, objective purposes, and 
all of that. I have always been entirely psychologically capable of accepting my own subjective values and goals, even though I know they are consummately inconsequential, and it 
doesnâ€™t bother me at all. 
The problem is not that I seek meaning and cannot find it. The problem is that I do feel 
immense meaning, and so does everyone else who is alive. Meaning is an abstract interpretation of value which exists only because of life. Just as I sought to eradicate the delusional 
values which culture infected me with, the final solution is the termination of my life, to rid 
myself of all value. The solution cannot be to embrace some aspect of life, as if the erosion 
of delusions is the cause of this. Life is what urgently caused me to have value, and changing 
my life will never do anything but create different delusions than the ones I already have. 
Unfortunately, as of right now I lack the discipline to pursue my death â€” death and to rid 
myself of the values which delude me, even though I recognize the solution to life is death. 
But I do commend others who do commit suicide. They have freed themselves from culture, 
life, and all value. They have freed themselves from themselves.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"I suppose I should add a video to my channel where Iâ€™m not reading something which I wrote before the video, and instead just ramble about ... basically whatever comes to mind, so that I seem like less of a robot. And I . .. I havenâ€™t slept very recently, so Iâ€™m probably going to ramble incoherently, but Iâ€™m â€” Iâ€™m not excusing my rambling, by really saying that though because I always ramble. But anyway, I was just recently thinking about all of this â€œit gets betterâ€ nonsense, you 
know, with, with um, pertaining to the teenagers being bullied into committing suicide. 
And, uh, just the concept of bullying in general. And Iâ€™ve, in my life, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever 
conventionally been bullied. I canâ€™t really remember a single instance, but itâ€™s, it just seems 
so ironic, all of this nonsense. Eve-even though I wasnâ€™t bullied in a conventional sense, I was 
bullied in the normal cultural sense, which everyone is bullied in. And when people speak 
about that, â€œit â€” it gets betterâ€ nonsense, they say it in the context of, â€œWell our children are 
being bullied, what can we do to create an environment in which they can thrive?â€ And that 
seems like such a blatant contradiction to me because itâ€™s really demonstrating the true bul-
lying thatâ€™s going on, and that bullying is what every child is subjected to. The imposition 
of cultural values. And the only reason why they oppose . . . um, the conventional sense of 
bullying is because it interferes with their cultural imposition of value. And . . . itâ€™s just, eh, 
children are constantly bullied in every sense of the term, when it comes to their upbringing.
Like, one instance I recently remembered, this . . . heh, this isnâ€™t I guess, a very good representation of what Iâ€™m talking about, but I remember when I was about ten years old, and at 
the end of the day in elementary school we would get into lines and go from room to room, 
to gather the kids for the right bus. And I remember that, when I was in the line, we would 
get to a section of portable rooms which werenâ€™t connected to the main hallway so we would 
wait at that door which leads to them. And . . . um, the students, from there, would come join 
the line, and I remembered that usually I would, I donâ€™t, I donâ€™t really remember what I was 
doing but I would frantically signal to them as if there were some emergency. Um, I wasnâ€™t 
serious, I was . . . I donâ€™t know what I was doing, I was just bored I guess.
And anyway, one day I looked through the window from the door leading to the portable 
classrooms, and I saw that the principal of the school was speaking to someone over there. 
And I thought, Oh well, I canâ€™t goof around when sheâ€™s there, so I said out loud to the people, 
um, to the other students that were at the line there with me, I said, â€œOh the principal is 
there, well, I donâ€™t care,â€ and by that time I just thought I was going to just, flap around, 
just motion as if there were some emergency, anyway, just fooling around. And 
the vice principal happened to be standing behind me, hearing me say, â€œOh the principalâ€™s 
there, oh I donâ€™t care,â€ and she said the statement, â€œYou should care,â€ avâ€” as if it were . . . 
eh, something very insightful, and wise. And even though she misunderstood the context 
of what I was saying, itâ€™s ignoring that, just, looking at that statement, â€œYou SHOULD care,â€ 
and that really . . . is a representation of, what childhood is. Itâ€™s children saying, â€œI donâ€™t care, 
I donâ€™t want your values, I donâ€™t want to live,â€ and adults constantly saying, â€œYou should care 
about values, you should choose culture, you should choose life,â€ and thatâ€™s what parenting 
and childhood and education and all of that is. Itâ€™s just adults bullying children into accept-
ing their values. So how can you possibly criticize people for mocking the homosexuals and 
bullying them in some sense, when youâ€™re the ones whoâ€™re incessantly bullying children? 
And, in that vein, um, heh, man, and the children, they grow up to do the same exact thing. 
And they just senselessly propagate these cultural memes . . . forever. It just keeps going on, 
they keep bullying each other, and thereâ€™s no point to any of it.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"And this kind of ties into an interest I have, which is . . . well, heh, um . . . basically the way in 
which society treats pedophiles. And before I go any further, I should say, Iâ€™m not a pedophile, 
Iâ€™ve never knowingly had any contact with any pedophiles . . . at all. And, just strictly an aca-
academic interest in the subject, but . . . it . . . this whole bullying theme, itâ€™s remarkable how 
they can say that homosexual teenagers are being bullied, when any discrimination which 
homosexuals face is infinitely more insignificant when compared to the discrimination which pedophiles are faced agaâ€” wiâ€” um, face against. Um, I mean, first off everyone 
hates you, youâ€™re subject to innumerable hate crimes just right off the bat, but if youâ€™re ever 
known to have engaged in a pedophilic relationship with a child, youâ€™re instantly imprisoned 
for prolonged periods. Youâ€™re put on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. You are brutalized in prison, and people actually celebrate that as if itâ€™s a good thing. And then if 
youâ€™re lucky enough to escape prison with your life, youâ€™re on that sex offenders registry or 
possibly castrated, you are tracked with a Gps device in some instances, and . . . the-there are 
just, so many issues pedophiles face, and everyone seems to think that itâ€™s not a problem at 
all, itâ€™s somehow justified that theyâ€™re treated in that manner.
And . . . and, you have to develop such extensive arguments just to refute that delusion, that 
somehow having sex with children is harmful to them innately. When, Iâ€™m . . . Iâ€™ve written 
an essay thatâ€™s already ten thousand and, Iâ€™m nowhere near finished and itâ€™s already ten 
thousand words long with eight thousand words and notes that I have to add. Itâ€™ll probably 
end up over twenty-five thousand words and itâ€™s just refuting this simple nonsense. And 
basically, all that it really boils down to, is that children arenâ€™t harmed by having sex, the 
reason why pedophilia is opposed is because it combines an atavistic cultural opposition 
to sex with the undermining of authority of adults who relegate children to the property of 
status. Uh, eh, sorry, to the status of their property. Iâ€™ve . . . typed that sentence, or forms of 
it, so many times, and itâ€™s really all that it is. Itâ€™s just that youâ€™re undermining their author-
ity to impose their cultural values on children, and of course when you interfere with that 
process, people are going to react violently. And itâ€™s . . . not innately harmful for children 
to have sex, itâ€™s . . . so absurd, Iâ€™ve never seen a valid argument stating as such. And, um, 
really thatâ€™s all that culture is. Itâ€™s just the impâ€” the reason why Iâ€™m interested in this topic 
of pedophilia, is not because I have any ties to it, at all. Itâ€™s because it really represents what 
culture is. Itâ€™s a bunch of lies which exist to propagate itself. Infecting countless children 
for countless generations and just . . . continuing to perpet-perpetuate, heh, I promise in 
the future Iâ€™ll make some videos about pedophilia Iâ€™m not just gonna leave it on that note. 
Um. My . . . arguments are much more refined than what Iâ€™ve just stated, but really itâ€™s just 
a bunch of nonsense.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"And . . . why do . . . people even people seem to think that theyâ€™re doing their children a favor, 
when theyâ€™re imposing values on them. Theyâ€™re thinking, My values are so great that a child 
needs to be brought up with them, they, um, they â€” they donâ€™t really realize what theyâ€™re 
doing. And, first off Iâ€™m talking about people who actually choose to have children, instead 
of the â€œOh whoops the condom broke, guess I just raped the soul of our offspring,â€ instead 
Iâ€™m talking about those people who um intend on having children and intend on giving them 
a quote â€œbetter lifeâ€ than they had.
These people experienced what they consider to be trauma when they were children, saying, 
â€œOh my family was too poor to provide for usâ€ or â€œOh my family somehow abused us,â€ and 
because of that they think that they can do their children a favor by changing their behavior 
when having their children. But youâ€™re not doing your children any favors, youâ€™re not, itâ€™s 
like they think that youâ€™re â€” that somehow that process of parenting is progressing towards 
some enlightenment, but itâ€™s, itâ€™s not doing that at all, the only reason why you would want 
to do that with your children is because, not because youâ€™re being selfless, youâ€™re being 
selfish. Youâ€™re trying to remedy your own psychological baggage. I mean, the children have 
nothing to do with it, they donâ€™t exist, they donâ€™t, they arenâ€™t subjected to whatever you were 
subjected to. Itâ€™s, uh, I donâ€™t even know.
You donâ€™t do your children a favor by raising them in any way, all that youâ€™re doing is impos-
ing values onto them and theyâ€™re going to have to do the same thing to their children, to fix 
their baggage and all of that nonsense. You think that youâ€™re progressing toward something, 
and Iâ€™m not saying that youâ€™re not progressing, that youâ€™re somehow deviating from some 
progression or that youâ€™re going in circles. Iâ€™m not saying that at all, youâ€™re not going in 
circles, youâ€™re not progressing, youâ€™re, um, youâ€™re not doing anything. Thereâ€™s no movement at all, youâ€™re â€” youâ€™re stuck in the zeroth dimension and Iâ€™m stuck in 
the zeroth dimension with no movement at all because thatâ€™s the structure of life and thatâ€™s 
what value demands, youâ€™re jusâ€” youâ€™re not accomplishing anything by doing any of this, 
youâ€™re just trying to fulfill the values that youâ€™ve been instilled with. And if you donâ€™t have 
children, you donâ€™t need to fulfill any of those values. Uh. Not sure where I should go right 
now, I mean, what I should talk about.
It really irritates me how people . . . they seem to say that, why should it be celebrated when 
a child is born? I think that you should say, um, â€œIâ€™m so sorry for your lossâ€ whenever you 
hear that someone is pregnant. And itâ€™s the same thing with suicide, I used to feel sorry for 
people who committed suicide, but I think they have the right idea.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"And now I commend them, I think that people should throw celebrations when someone 
commits suicide because . . . theyâ€™re able to escape this value trap. And . . . heh . . . I wish I were 
that determined, but Iâ€™m still psychologically stuck in all of this, I probably wonâ€™t be pursuing 
that any time soon, but Iâ€™ve never heard a single good argument against suicide. [laughter] 
My favorite one is â€œItâ€™s selfish to commit suicide!â€ as if itâ€™s somehow not selfish for those 
people to force that person to live who has already determined that life is not worth living, 
just so that they can fulfill their needs. Or rather their values, you donâ€™t need anything. But 
I guess in the vein of that whole, parenting thing, you imposing values onto your children 
to address your own . . . thatâ€™s basically all that politics is, anyway. I used to enjoy reading, um, anything written by authors like . . . Proudhon, Kropotkin, espe-
cially Tolstoy, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Benjamin Tucker, basically any anarchist 
whether they are â€” they were individualists or collectivists, I enjoyed all of that, and it â€” I used 
to think that I was progressing toward something by learning about anarchist philosophy. 
But as if it were somehow anti-cultural, as if I were destroying some [archons?] of the mind. 
But I . . . I was doing no such thing, the only reason why I was ever interested in anarchist 
philosophy is because I felt . . . because of the experiences I had in my life, I felt as if I were 
hurt by the concept of authority. And if I had never been exposed to that concept, I wouldâ€™ve 
never pursued any of this, anarchist philosophy. And thatâ€™s basically an understatement of 
what I was thinking back then. But it, I guess the essence of it. And so thatâ€™s all that politics 
is, people whoâ€™ve, because of the lives theyâ€™ve lived have acquired certain values and they try 
to fulfill that by promoting their political agenda as if itâ€™s . . . somehow progressing towards 
something, but itâ€™s not, itâ€™s just addressing your psychological baggage.
And itâ€™s, itâ€™s all complete nonsense. I wasnâ€™t anti-cultural in the sense that I thought I was 
getting beyond culture. I was â€” it was just counterculture. And thatâ€™s basically, well thatâ€™s 
basically all of life . . . and now Iâ€™m getting into the incoherent stage. [laughter] Um, anyway, 
people think that, Oh, well of course politics matters, because peopleâ€™s rights need to be 
enforced, right? But thatâ€™s not true because these rights are just another cultural abstrac-
tion. They . . . um, they â€” they donâ€™t exist at all. Um, basically, I â€” eh, they say that . . . you 
can somehow derive rights through some criteria, whatever that may be, or those may be, 
and I used to think that that were possible, in some sense. That doing those things were 
possible, but I â€” I and I used to believe in the concept of logical contradictions, but I was 
just misinterpreting the way in which logic was applied to determine rights. Such as, I used to think it was a contradiction for people to say . . . screensaver just came 
on, heh, um . . . thatâ€™s going nowhere. Um, that it was a contradiction for people to say that 
bestiality somehow violated an animalâ€™s rights and yet those same people, the same meat-
eaters, would advocate factory-farming. And they didnâ€™t think that violated animalsâ€ rights, 
when how could you possibly say that having sex with an animal violates its rights but killing 
the animals not? It didnâ€™t make any sense to me, but I was just misinterpreting the way that 
they were using their so-called logic.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"They werenâ€™t using their logic so that they could determine what rights existed, they were 
applying their logic so that they could determine how they could best fulfill their subjective 
values. So basically when they saw someone having sex with an animal, they thought, Ew, I 
donâ€™t like that, I should create a right by which an animal can be free from this so I can be 
free from that and then they say, â€œOh, bacon is tasty so therefore we should create property 
rights over animalsâ€ and â€œNo, animals donâ€™t have a right to live because X.Y.Z.,â€ and you try 
to refute those assertions but itâ€™s not those assertions upon which their argument is based. 
Itâ€™s just based in the fulfilment of their subjective values and thatâ€™s really all that rights are.
And hereâ€™s another sentence I used to write all the time, or type all the time, but Iâ€™ll try to get 
it right: â€œRights are just euphemisms for the use of violence against someone who deviates 
from the fulfilment of the subjective values of a group which has the capacity to kill,â€ I think 
that basically describes it, and thatâ€™s really all that it is. Itâ€™s just a group with the capacity to 
kill who is coercing people into behaving in ways which allow the maximum fulfilment of 
their subjective values.
And mor-morality is similar . . . not identical, but similar. Um, morality doesnâ€™t exist and I donâ€™t 
mean morality is subjective, I mean moral statements have no validity, they are completely 
incoherent. Itâ€™s, um . . . morality is basically just a cultural abstraction of subjective values, 
so people just select arbitrary values and then they say . . . an-and they duct-taped the-them 
together under â€” under the banner of moral language, and the-they say, â€œMy behavior is 
ethically or morally justifiedâ€ instead of saying â€œMy value is leading me to act in this wayâ€ 
and thatâ€™s all there is to thâ€” morality, thereâ€™s really nothing more.
Oh man I just remembered, I guess I should comment on this whole race thing, with 
HeyRuka, HeyRuka and whatnot.4 I donâ€™t really understand why . . . if people like HeyRuka 
want to advocate segregation of races beâ€” so that they can, because they value those races, 
because they put value in those racesâ€™ value so much that they want . . . that value to prosper, 
in their own settings, if theyâ€™re so obsessed with the value I donâ€™t understand why they stop 
at ethnicity instead of some other category because, itâ€™s quite obvious that even among eth-
nicities, their values are radically different so if they love value so much then I donâ€™t know 
why theyâ€™re focusing on race, I think . . . itâ€™s probably just another abstraction that only, I 
donâ€™t want to spend time thinking about it because itâ€™s so pointless.
And Iâ€™m not saying that, um, we should encourage diversity and . . . Iâ€™m not saying that we 
should segregate, because both intre-integration and segregation are nonsensical. Theyâ€™re 
just two systems under which culture prospers and we all lose. Thereâ€™s really no difference 
between them. This ties into what I used to, sort of, my prior thinking, I used to address the 
issue of language being cultural. Oh man, I hate language so much, maybe Iâ€™ll talk about that 
later. But I used to address the problem of language being cultural, by just saying, â€œOh um, 
Esperanâ€” worldwide implil-implementation of Esperanto should solve that problemâ€ it was 
such a trivial, um, way to deal with that, because I wasnâ€™t . . . all that, um, integration allows 
to happen is to â€” all that it does is kill competing viruses while â€” to let one virus prosper. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"Thereâ€™s really no difference between integration and segregation, itâ€™s just the propagation of culture under different systems. And about language . . . oh man, I have a special place in 
my heart for language because itâ€™s the primary method by which cultural values are coerced 
onto other people.
And you canâ€™t, itâ€™s like the wheezing of someone with tuberculosis. Itâ€™s a symptom of it, 
itâ€™s also the method by which it propagates to other victims, and thereâ€™s nothing you can 
do about it. Youâ€™re for â€” um, forever stuck with this, language, all these abstractions . . . but 
here Iâ€™m going back into my, my anarcho-quasiâ€” I should say quasi-anarcho-primitivist 
ideology when really, itâ€™s not culture thatâ€™s the problem, itâ€™s value thatâ€™s the problem. Itâ€™s 
the structure of value itself, itâ€™s not only cultural value, itâ€™s fler-feral value too. Itâ€™s all a part 
of the same nonsense . . . and sort of similar, to the whole race debacle, is the Efilists,5 um, 
even though Iâ€™m adamantly opposed to the structure of life, I . . . I differ from the Efilists in 
several regards, and the main issue is their . . . um, they invoke these cultural abstractions 
like rights and morality to further their ideology. And, Iâ€™m not appealing to anything, Iâ€™ve 
recognized that thereâ€™s nothing transcendent about my ideas, theyâ€™re just a consequence of 
the life Iâ€™ve lived, but itâ€™s kind of like how Jay Sender[?] said, there . . . there are so many people 
from different backgrounds who come to the same conclusion about antinatalism, about 
the structure of life, itâ€™s um . . . ah, not appealing to anything, you can just look for yourself 
at the structure of life and you can see, itâ€™s â€” itâ€™s just like how Gary6 says itâ€™s, he says that, 
the simplest way, itâ€™s just a need that you did, itâ€™s just a need that need not exist. And thatâ€™s 
all that life is, and itâ€™s so easy to see that. That youâ€™re just, fulfilling these values which . . . 
thereâ€™s, which have no reason to exist. And I donâ€™t need to say itâ€™s immoral[?] to fulfill that, 
I just say . . . itâ€™s ridiculous according to my own standards, and apparently the standards of 
many other people. I mean Iâ€™m not really sure I can communicate this, maybe itâ€™s not even 
possible to communicate this, because of the structure of life. Because I canâ€™t free myself 
from value and still communicate that I hate value.
Itâ€™s my value which leads me to hating value. [sigh] And another thing about the Efilists is 
that a lot of them seem to think, that is, eh, itâ€™s, that itâ€™s possible for there to be . . . itâ€™s pos-
sible for there to be an instance under which it would be a good idea to propagate life, that 
if suffering were abolished tomorrow, that it would be okay to bring new lives into the world 
or to live your current life. But I donâ€™t really focus on suffering, at least not directly I focus on 
really, value itself, thatâ€™s the problem. Even if there were Paradise tomorrow, and there were 
no suffering forever in the future, I would still be advocating this position because I . . . you 
can sum me up in one sentence: I have a vendetta against value. So instead of an Efilist Iâ€™m 
more of a . . . eulavist.7 Eh, I only oppose life because life is the source of value and itâ€™s value 
that I really hate. And, well, I guess that just says it all: I have a vendetta against value. And 
I guess thatâ€™s a good place to finish my video, I mean I basically support the Efilists because 
I do hate life and value, but um . . . itâ€™s just that I have several problems with them . . . and 
also the same applies to Gary there are a lot of things I disagree with him about but listening 
to his rants are kind of my idea of pornography. Itâ€™s just fun to listen to.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Ramble,"Oh, and speaking about pornography, if anyone comments on this video, Iâ€™m sure that ninety 
percent of them will be about the whole â€œpedophiliaâ€ thing, and I just want to emphasize I 
am not a pedophile, I donâ€™t know any pedophiles, itâ€™s just an academic interest. And if any 
of you, eh, â€œpedo-phobicâ€ um, inclined individuals want to comment about this, Iâ€™d like to hear some unique arguments affirming the position that children having sex is innately 
harmful, because itâ€™s been a really long time since Iâ€™ve found a unique argument advocating 
that position. So . . . if you can, try to add some of those in the comments, but . . . um, until 
then, thanks for listening and maybe someday in the future Iâ€™ll . . . I will definitely in the 
future make some videos about pedophilia and elaborate on my position, but also someday 
in the future maybe Iâ€™ll add another one of these rambling videos, depending on how well 
this comes out. I should listen to it and probably think oh that, about myself, Oh that guyâ€™s 
such a liar, just listen to his voice, listening to his intonation, heâ€™s obviously a pedophile! 
And who knows? . . . Maybe I am.
",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"Or rather, activist antinatalism, efilism, eulavism â€” call it whatever you 
want. The point is, thereâ€™s no need to even bring suffering into the picture because even eternal 
utopia doesnâ€™t change what â€œThe Goodâ€ and â€œthe goodâ€ are.
 I should have elaborated on what I meant by this video, but it -was- â€œat light speedâ€. This is directed 
toward the people who say things like, â€œExtinction?! But without humans, there will be no art; there 
will be no nobility; there will be no kindness; there will be no goodnessâ€.
Goodness is the fulfilment of value; value exists only in life. If there is no life, there is no 
value. And thus, goodness becomes an entirely irrelevant concept.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"So, I did that so that they would say, â€œWow this kid is fucked up, Iâ€™d better not mess him up 
anymore.â€ And . . . Iâ€™ve, it, uh . . . subordination disgusts me. One of the most grating things 
I can hear is â€œMy parents raised me to believe thatâ€ or â€œMy parents always told me that,â€ I 
. . . Itâ€™s . . . I had to cut back to this because Iâ€™m trying to think of how I can express this. I, 
you hear things like â€œI donâ€™t need to spank my children because thereâ€™re other methods of 
discipline available,â€ and I used to think that it could be possible to have children and not 
discipline them, because I perceived values at potentially having some degree of validity, and 
I would think â€œwhy do you need to coerce a child into behaving in certain ways when you can 
use reason?â€ But you canâ€™t use reason because culture, there, there is no reason involved, 
cultural values are not reasonable. Culture, the only way that culture can spread is through 
coercion, and so thatâ€™s why parents, even egalitarian ones, focus on the word â€œdisciplineâ€ 
because thereâ€™s no other way to go about spreading these lies because children will instantly 
reject them. A child can see that all of this is nonsense, and thatâ€™s why they go through this 
terrible twos stage, when theyâ€™re toddlers theyâ€™re incessantly miserable and itâ€™s . . . itâ€™s children 
donâ€™t, offspring donâ€™t naturally rebel against their parents like that.
Um, you donâ€™t see chimpanzee toddlers freaking out about their . . . they have scuffles, but 
they donâ€™t have this rebellion against their parents. And the reason why this rebellion exists 
in humans is because this cultural infection is being involved, theyâ€™re trying to rebel against 
this indoctrination process but of course, they always end up caâ€” succumbing to it in the end 
and no longer see how delusional it is, and even still I . . . I donâ€™t entirely see how delusional 
I am, because I still have this notion that even though I nominally recognize that itâ€™s false, 
I, I still have â€” I still operate under this belief that itâ€™s possible for value, different values to 
be more valid than other values.
And thinking about this response video caused me to remember that a while ago I saw a 
documentary about bonobo chimps being taught language. Basically, theyâ€™re being indoctrinated into accepting culture and Iâ€™ve seen some . . . immensely gory shockumentaries, 
but they were Barney compared to the horror that was in this documentary, and in all of 
the videos you can find on YouTube about apes being taught things. Um . . . Iâ€™ll link to the 
specific video Iâ€™m talking about, but the entire thing was . . . horrible. But I remember two 
particular scenes, there was one where this bonobo chimp was excited and it hopped onto 
a dog, and one of the prison guards um . . . was, um . . . bullying it, saying, â€œBad, bad, bad, 
badâ€ continuously, it was like a nightmare and the . . . you could just tell the chimp wasnâ€™t 
recognizing that what it did was wrong, it was being instilled with this belief that it was bad, 
and itâ€™s . . . one of there was this other scene where, it mightâ€™ve been the same chimp but 
Iâ€™m not sure. This bonobo chimp was trying to be, they were tryâ€” the prison guards were 
trying to teach this chimp language and the chimp, they spend their entire lives in this prison 
complex and these aliens are trying to coerce these stupid things onto them and they have 
no idea whatâ€™s going on. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"All that they know is that theyâ€™re being forced into doing things. And this chimp, um, snapped and, because of all of this, the circumstances of its life, and it 
started attacking one of the prison guards . . . it um, it kicked her, I think, and she proceeded 
to chase it around shouting at it, bullying it, trying to intimidate it, and the . . . the poor chimp 
was terrified and if you want to understand why I hate culture, just watch these videos, those 
two scenes were among the most horrible things Iâ€™ve seen in my life because it embodies 
what I went through and embodies what every single other human goes through thatâ€™s 
exposed to culture, and itâ€™s the saddest thing imaginable. Just. watch these YouTube videos 
about apes being indoctrinated and you can just see the sorrow and that sorrow is culture, 
thereâ€™s nothing more to it, itâ€™s horrible. â€œI wish I could be indifferent but I am still affected by the solution 
that life is something worth retaliating againstâ€ â€” Well, that is because you overestimate . . . 
the extent to which there is culture. You think that your own values are culture, are culture induced, in fact they arenâ€™t, those would be from you. But how do you distinguish that? As 
you tried to do, you tried to do sorta like a Descartes thing where you sort of went into the 
basement, â€œWhat are my values and how do these relate to society,â€ and tried to figure it 
out that way. Where I had sufficiently freed myself from what I called â€œcultural valuesâ€ when I analyzed all of the things which brought me happiness and all the goals which 
I wanted to pursue, I realized that absolutely everything about those things that appealed to 
me was entirely a consequence of my cultural infection. Uh, no, not a cultural infection, that results in your genetics, really.
[Recording of Lanza:] Formerly, I had rejected some aspects of culture while accepting other 
ones, and merely not calling them cultural. Well, why did you accept them? Same reason that people of the 
Bible say, â€œOh yeah I like that, I donâ€™t like that,â€ well why are they like that? Maybe itâ€™s because they resonate with it, so how is that from culture when itâ€™s from you resonating with 
something else? Thatâ€™s â€™cause I realize . . .Thatâ€™s from YOU, what is the loud self without others? Everything 
self, everything who, is a relation of you, to someone else. Can you find any spot, anything, 
anywhere, where itâ€™s not you in relation to someone else? You might say â€œoh I write characters in a book,â€ well thatâ€™s you playing and experimenting with yourself in relation to others, 
with yourself. So that simply putting it on a mental level. I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s necessarily true. Thereâ€™s a huge part of what people call 
â€œthe selfâ€ but . . . there are two selves that I can identify. Thereâ€™s the cultural self and thereâ€™s 
the feral self. And . . . I think there is a real distinction between the two, I would . . . the feral 
self, I would call that which . . . genetically exists independent from whatever memes the 
creature might be exposed to. So the pleasure that you get from drinking water or climbing 
trees, the pleasure that a feral child would get is feral, it has nothing to do with culture. That 
. . . um, cultural, that cultural self is that which results from enculturation, it values that are 
created which do not exist independent from that cultural exposure. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"People do have, independently have some degree of personalities and you can see that in 
animals, and you can take me for instance . . . Iâ€™ve always been a compulsive organizer, and 
I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s cultural because I exhibited that behavior at an extremely young age. So, 
when Iâ€™m in the process of making this video, I watched your video once, thought about it, 
watched it a second time, thought about it, and I was watching it the third time while I was 
typing out the points that I wanted to respond to.
And then when I finished, I rearranged those points and took the most relevant ones and 
then, now Iâ€™m responding to those and Iâ€™ll insert your um . . . points, and Iâ€™m going about 
this in the . . . heh, compulsively organized way because I â€” I feel compulsion that I canâ€™t 
respond unless I do it in this way.
And I think that compulsion has nothing to do with culture, but the reason Iâ€™m making this 
YouTube video at all is entirely cultural. If . . . If I were a feral child, I . . . I would not need to 
fulfill this desire to make this YouTube video, but because Iâ€™ve been exposed to this concept 
of YouTube videos, I thus need to fulfill it. And I go about fulfilling it in my own way, but 
the reason why Iâ€™m fulfilling it at all is entirely cultural. So, my genetics affect the way I deal 
with these values but the values exist entirely because of culture. And a feral child doesnâ€™t 
. . . have a desire to write or read intricately designed novels, it, that desire does not exist 
at all but being exposed to culture would um instill that desire into them, and they would 
subsequently need to fulfill it. And the same applies to everything cultural and thatâ€™s my 
point about the distinction between cultural values and feral values. A feral child would be 
happy drinking water and climbing trees. Interaction is not necessarily cultural, the way that I view an ant colony, I 
donâ€™t think that ants are remotely cultural even though they form these organized societies. 
And, um, theyâ€™re, theyâ€™re, theyâ€™re not taught . . . theyâ€™re not exposed to memes which 
results in their behavior, theyâ€™re behaving in the ways they do because as far as I know theyâ€™re 
. . . responding to certain types of scents at certain frequencies, and itâ€™s like . . . um, needing 
to drink water. They say, â€œIâ€™m thirsty and Iâ€™m going to take this action to fulfill that thirstâ€ 
and I donâ€™t need to be taught that Iâ€™m thirsty, I, I just know it. And thatâ€™s the way that ants 
operate, and thatâ€™s how their societies emerge. Theyâ€™re not . . . they arenâ€™t instilled with this 
culture, and . . . that feral child whoâ€™s drinking water and climbing trees, he, he, if he werenâ€™t 
exposed to anyone else, he would have a desire for social interaction.
That desire itself is not cultural and . . . if he were to . . . like apes in a jungle, the apes, they 
have these very, very, very undeveloped cultures. But most of their interaction is based off 
of feral values, so Iâ€™ve . . . thereâ€™s this small cultural aspect to their interaction but itâ€™s mostly 
feral. Um, theyâ€™re fulfilling their feral values, they donâ€™t need to be taught that they want 
to interact, they just do. The way someone just drinks. And culture can satisfy feral values, 
thatâ€™s where it gets a little confusing, because making this video . . . it can be perceived as, 
me making this video can be perceived as trying to fulfill a desire for social interaction. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"But 
. . . um . . . the culture doesnâ€™t allow it to happen, it subverts the process by which I would 
naturally fulfill that value. This . . . because Iâ€™ve been exposed to this culture, I fulfill that value by making this video, and this videoâ€™s just . . . a surrogate, itâ€™s not the social interaction 
itself. If we were in a jungle somewhere, I, I wouldnâ€™t be making this video to you, and I 
wouldnâ€™t have the desire to make this video to you. I would stroke your hair and longfully 
gaze into your eyes, or whatever it is that feral humans do.
So, my point is that . . . culture is the proverbial thug who breaks your limbs and gives you 
a crutch. Culture doesnâ€™t fulfill values, it creates the need to fulfill values and it subverts 
the natural processes by which you would fulfill those values. Thatâ€™s why I used the disease 
metaphor, culture . . . I, I know itâ€™s needlessly inflammatory, but I think it is kind of an accurate description, even if you arenâ€™t paying attention to those cute little comparisons like 
how language is like the wheezing of someone with tuberculosis and all of those little things. 
Language, I mean, culture doesnâ€™t solve anything, it â€” it latches onto someone, and it creates 
the need to solve certain things. So instead of calling culture a disease . . . I, I think it would 
be, it could be called . . . the . . . uh, man, Iâ€™m gonna have to cut this out and . . . whatever. So everything is delusion? What is delusion? Delusion is that which 
does not correlate with reality, right? Right? Delusion is that which does not correlate with 
reality, is delusional to say that . . . this is a water bottle, if Iâ€™m holding up a mouse and I 
mean water bottle, this is not a water bottle, itâ€™s delusional if I think this is and I try to drink 
from it, that is delusional. It is not connected up with how things actually are. Now if youâ€™re 
talking about things that actually are the case, then that is not delusional. I wouldnâ€™t say that everything is a delusion, Iâ€™m, I, I donâ€™t know really 
that much about the epistemology but . . . um, I would say that value exists in the sense that 
religious dogma exists. It, this belief in religion exists but all its assertions about reality are 
nothing other than delusions. And in the same way, value exists but itâ€™s a distortion of reality. Um, perception is a coercive delusion, itâ€™s, it exists but as a delusion, (laughter). I know 
Iâ€™m just repeating myself but I think Iâ€™m getting the point across. The problem is that I do feel immense 
meaning, and so does everyone else. Enjoy it, so it is, it is there, and? I think Iâ€™ve addressed this, um, in my, earlier in this video but just in case I 
havenâ€™t, my point is that meaning doesnâ€™t cure suffering, meaning is the source of suffering. â€œHappiness is merely the fulfilment of valueâ€ . . . I disagree. Sometimes you wake up and youâ€™re just happy for no apparent reason, sometimes you just laugh for no apparent reason. ",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"It doesnâ€™t have to be dependent on a lack of something and 
the gaining of something, itâ€™s not all about a lack of stuff, itâ€™s not all about being cultural, 
you attach entirely too much value to culture. Oh, isnâ€™t that an irony? I agree that happiness isnâ€™t like prayer, where first you pray and then your 
prayers are answered. Since happiness is just biological, itâ€™s possible to just be happy, but in 
general the entire point of happiness is to serve as a reward for fulfilling value. First you have 
this desire, and then when you fulfill the desire, you achieve happiness. So, um . . . well a lot 
of the time when youâ€™re randomly happy itâ€™s because you donâ€™t perceive a certain deprivation 
to be important enough to affect your random happiness. I remember reading that one of 
the 9/11 hijackers was asked, eh, um, â€œWhy do you never laugh?â€ And he responded, â€œHow 
can you laugh when people in Palestine are dying?â€ And I think that someone like him wouldnâ€™t, because he havâ€” has this problem, I donâ€™t think that someone like him would ever, 
or at least not very often, experience random happiness. I think he would be suffering a lot.
[Lanza as SomethingSea:] Or, but you prefer to not be alive, and you prefer to . . . see, thereâ€™s 
a bit of a contradiction there, you prefer to not prefer? So, you prefer to not prefer so youâ€™re 
trying to not prefer not preferring, or youâ€™re trying not prefer, preferred or not preferring. 
So, your preference of not preferring is getting in the way of preferring not living because 
that would be better than living even though living, thatâ€™s a value statement about 
not having value statements because . . . and then you overstate that, such that you hate your 
own values. But itself is a stâ€” is a value statement, â€™cause hatred is a value thing and so you 
hating your own hatred, and so you hate yourself. Uh, thatâ€™s . . . the problem with all of this. A lot of people like Buddhists and 
Stoics, however they define enlightenment, they believe that enlightenment can be achieved 
in life. That you can overcome what they call â€œsuffering,â€ but I, my value leads me to hate 
value because well, [laughter] what you said. Itâ€™s incoherent and I think the problem about 
that is that I canâ€™t free myself from value and still be alive. So, the enlightenment, which I 
use very, very, very loosely, my enlightenment lies in death where I, I do not have any value. â€œCulture has values which 
others mindlessly coerce each othâ€” into, onto each other,â€ hm . . . thatâ€™s true in a spiritual 
sense in that we cannot continue living in this 3d realm without the assumption of these 
value things, i.e., morality this, morality that, itâ€™s basically . . . in order to be alive in this 3d 
realm, you have to have some sort of moral value in going about you. Well not necessarily 
have to, but itâ€™s very likely for it to be occurring, that is the cultural programming.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"â€œSpreading it no differently than any other disease.â€ 
Um, similar, Iâ€™d say not no differently but quite similar. Why do you want to eliminate your 
cultural values? If you eliminate your cultural values, all your values, you cease to exist. Why? 
Because you cease to see any reason to living, therefore you die, by one reason or another. 
Or you continue living and hate yourself the entire time. That doesnâ€™t sound like fun, might 
as well just put a gun to your head and go boom.  Thatâ€™s, heh, thatâ€™s basically the idea . . . um, I donâ€™t want to live, I want to die. What do you mean by you lack the discipline to commit suicide? 
That doesnâ€™t make any sense to me, lack the discipline . . . so, so like when you think about 
committing suicide, what go â€” what do â€” what goes through your mind?  Iâ€™m definitely not happy to be alive. I . . . um, I, I, would like to die, but the 
reason why . . . when I think about, when I get the thought into my head, Youâ€™re going to kill 
yourself in one minute, I . . . um, I . . . Iâ€™m compelled to live in the same sense that someone 
who is addicted to cocaine is compelled to continue their indulgence. They â€” they definitely 
donâ€™t, well, heh, sometimes . . . they definitely donâ€™t want to be addicted to cocaine, but they 
canâ€™t control it because they donâ€™t have enough self discipline. And thatâ€™s the problem 
that I have, a cocaine addict will say, â€œOh, this â€” this is the last time, Iâ€™m definitely not going 
to do it again, once I take it this last timeâ€ but if it were truly the last time then they wouldnâ€™t 
need to . . . indulge with . . . they wouldnâ€™t need to have that last indulgence. So, theyâ€™re not 
really overcoming their addiction, theyâ€™re just continuing to feed it just as much as they 
were previously and Iâ€™m in the same position. I think, Oh, this period of time will be good 
and then Iâ€™ll die, and . . . it ends up not being the last period because if it really were the last 
period, I would just kill myself instantly, instead of having to continue to live through that.
Thereâ€™s, I, I can think of two ways that you can choose to overcome an addiction. The first 
is that you can have the self discipline to recognize that you need to overcome your addiction, and . . . you know that youâ€™ll have an intense desire to persist in your addiction but if you um 
. . . continue to persist in overcoming it, youâ€™ll, that desire will eventually disappear. And I . . . 
I donâ€™t have that discipline. Thereâ€™s one other way you can choose to overcome an addiction 
and that is to allow your addiction to get you into some circumstances such that continuing the addiction would have more, would have much more intolerable consequences than 
ending the addiction would have. Such as a cocaine addict ending up living in a dumpster, 
blowing strangers for cocaine money, that kind of a thing. And they would feel forced into 
giving up their addiction, and I think thatâ€™s the position that I need to be in to overcome 
this, because my life right now is . . . I hate using this word because itâ€™s misleading, but my 
life right now is way too comfortable to . . . for me to feel forced into killing myself. But . . . 
thatâ€™s probably going to be the way I die, Iâ€™m going to . . . I, I, well either that or Iâ€™ll develop 
the discipline to just say, â€œNone of this is helping me I just need to die and I know that I 
wonâ€™t want to go through with it at the last second but I just need to do itâ€ and I guess thatâ€™s 
the end of the response video, heh, Iâ€™m sorry to end on such a macabre note. I know that I 
can kind of â€œrain on the parade,â€ but . . . well, hehe, you wanted a response video so here it 
is. Thanks for listening.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"Hello, SomethingSea. Thank you for the response to my â€œMy Antinatalismâ€ video. Um, I rearranged some of the things you said so that I could make my response 
clearer, so whoever else is watching this, you should first watch my â€œMy Antinatalismâ€ video, 
so that you can actually hear what Iâ€™m saying. And I agree that, um, I speak too quietly, and I 
mumble too much, and my computerâ€™s loud, Iâ€™ll â€” Iâ€™ll try to resolve all of that . . . and once you 
watch that video, you should watch his response and then . . . watch this response. Because 
just watching my â€” this video by itself isnâ€™t going to be an accurate representation of his video.
[Lanza as SomethingSea:] Thatâ€™s not antinatalism, thatâ€™s, uhh, anatalism, suppose that anatalism means â€œpositive of lifeâ€? Fuck is anatalism Iâ€™m going to look that up. Natalism is a belief 
that promotes human reproduction. Okay, so you would be an anatalist, not an antinatalist 
in that case. I agree that antinatalism is an inaccurate term to be using . . . to describe 
my position. The reason why I use that is because itâ€™s the kind â€” itâ€™s the kind of terminology that other people on YouTube are using for similar positions, and um . . . despite that, 
I actually do agree with antinatalism, I would like it if life stopped propagating. But I think 
my position can be more accurately stated as antivalueism, or something like that.
[Lanza as SomethingSea:] What, why the emphasis on, on the existential aspect it almost 
sounds like youâ€™re being too defensive? I was being too defensive at that part, um, when Iâ€™m trying to figure something out, I open WordPad and then I type in a thought, and then press enter a few times, 
type in another thought, and another thought and it all gradually ends up becoming sort 
of a personal essay. And most of that video came from one of those essays I wrote a while 
ago, but . . . that existentialism paragraph, I took verbatim from what I wrote, so. When Iâ€™m 
writing these things, Iâ€™m usually in an emotional state and I wrote that after looking online 
for â€œreasons why you shouldnâ€™t kill yourself,â€ and I wasnâ€™t trying to find a compelling argument, I was just bored and I found so many people responding to suicidal forum posters, 
saying, â€œI know exactly where youâ€™ve been, I too have felt that my life was out, was without 
meaning,â€ and . . . heh, it was ironic because . . . I have the opposite problem. So, I was just 
getting kind of irritated with seeing that relentlessly and not seeing a single person expressing what I was feeling. Youâ€™ve always had immense hatred for culture. Why? I wish I could express why I hate culture in one sentence, but . . . thatâ€™s, 
um, thatâ€™s not going to happen, Iâ€™m going to have to ramble about this topic so forgive me 
for that. But I basically perceive culture the way that a normal person would perceive rape, 
and all of these abstractions are . . . the incurable stds in my mind. Iâ€™ve . . . um . . . Iâ€™ve always 
reacted with terror to culture. Whenevâ€” Iâ€™ve always had a problem with authority figures, and 
I would call authority, um, a source which tries to impose values onto you. And so, whenever 
I would interact with someone in an authoritative position, I would, I would always be eager 
to punish myself and hit myself and say how much I deserved to be tortured and that kind 
of thing. And I think the reason why I used to do that, even though I didnâ€™t understand it at 
the time, I think it was because I wanted to try to mitigate um . . . their, quote â€œdisciplineâ€ 
of me, even if it was a situation which they wouldnâ€™t even be doing that, itâ€™s just interacting 
with an authority figure would upset me greatly.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Dream,"I just woke up about ten minutes ago and I had a strange dream so I thought I would explain 
it. The background was basically, long story short was, I was in high school and I wasnâ€™t doing 
what I was supposed to do and told the authority figures to fuck off and I got imprisoned. So, 
ha, after that I was at my prison cell and two of the other prisoners got on guard duty, I donâ€™t 
know. Let me out, one of them was apparently an ex-gang leader . . . not sure why. And they 
led me to a desk where there was this poorly constructed wooden tricycle with low-quality 
rubber wheels or something like that.
We went up to the receptionistâ€™s desk, I donâ€™t know . . . who he was, but he told me good luck 
and I got on the tricycle and started â€” they brought me over to a door and the receptionist 
told me to get in touch with my young side, or something like that. So, I started breathing 
heavily, thinking â€œokay Iâ€™ve got to prepare for somethingâ€ as we approached the door. And 
bravely ensued [?] into the room and it was the interior of a gym-gymnasium and there was 
this group of â€” of . . . spectators sitting on the floor in a circle, around some type of obstacle 
course that was about maybe twenty-five feet wide. And . . . it wasnâ€™t meant to be completed 
vertically, it was a horizontal course that you were supposed to circle around, and thereâ€™s 
this star pattern in the center, but a little off to one of the sides . . . and you had to maneuver 
around this course using the tricycle. And make it as entertaining for the crowd as possible.
So, you were supposed to go around five times, for my first round, and there were five other 
prisoners who were competing and presumably whoever the crowd found most entertaining 
would get to be freed from the prison. So, for my first round I was . . . instead of riding the 
tricycle I was, you know how when you . . . have a bicycle you can kind of use the wheels to 
bounce? So thatâ€™s what I was doing, I was bouncing twenty feet into the air. And the crowd 
liked that and I threw in some tricks in the second round where I was . . . um, spinning 360 
degrees and that kind of thing, and on the third round I started going backward and the 
crowd really liked that but after a few bounces I accidentally went out of bounds. They were cheering as I was leaving, and of course there was one guy who was saying, â€œYou 
fucking suckâ€ but I sat out with the crowd and started watching the next two 
prisoners to see what they were going to do, that was supposed to be entertaining. Oh yeah 
and the outlines of this obstacle course um, had balloons laid around them, different colors. 
And once I got out of the course, my tricycle turned into this . . . balloon that was starting to 
lose its helium. Well, they â€” it didnâ€™t have any helium, it probably had a heavier-than-air gas 
in it, all of the balloons did and my balloon, um, was starting to lose its air. But I was watch-
ing the two other prisoners and all that they were â€” did to be entertaining was play some of 
the, what do they call it? Benny Hill theme music, and starts . . . tossing a balloon between 
the two of them. And I was thinking, â€œthis â€” thatâ€™s, theyâ€™re not even doing anything, Iâ€™m go-
ing to win this competitionâ€ and then that was basically the point at which I woke up. And 
I thought, what was that? So anytime that Iâ€™m â€” end up waking up and asking myself, What 
did I just dream?",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
AdamLanza,Suffering,"Iâ€™m sure that any psychiatrists (secular priests) and TheRapists who would 
seek to dismiss my position as being the consequence of schizophrenia would orgasm if they read this:
 ~Life is the imposition of value. 
~Cultural values are the masochistic imposition of suffering through the deprivation of their 
fulfillment. 
~Feral values are the innate imposition of suffering through the deprivation of their fulfillment. 
~Suffering tends to serve as a life-affirming experience. 
~The less you suffer, the clearer you see that value is a disease. 
~Death eradicates value and thus is the solution to life.
Relatively speaking and within the context of being alive, I have always been in a very 
privileged position. At this point in my life, I can pursue and achieve practically anything I 
would desire. And if I were to commit suicide, Iâ€™m certain that â€” certain that many people 
would say, â€œI cannot believe that lazy spoiled loser killed himself. Iâ€™ve always been poor, my 
parents beat me, I was bullied every day as a child and I got raped, but despite all of that I 
still choose to live.â€
This may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but my position is that someone does not 
choose to live despite suffering, itâ€™s just to live because suffering is life affirming. The way 
that culture operates might help to demonstrate this, the first thing that anyone says when 
someone is suicidal, other than possibly saying, â€œYou need medication to change your 
mentally ill thoughtsâ€ is â€œYou need to have goals in your life,â€ but what are goals? A feral 
child does not have any goals, a feral child would not have any desire to become a renowned 
writer or an eminent scientist, or have interest in hobbies, or become an interesting person, 
or develop any â€” any of those character-building traits.
However, if that child were encultured, he would develop innumerable goals to achieve 
various things. Culture did not allow the feral child to discover the pleasure which he can 
achieve from experiencing any of those things, culture imposed the deprivation of not achiev-
ing those things, and thus created out of nothing, the pleasure which results from fulfilling 
that deprivation. Culture is masochism. Since life seeks to propagate itself, I suspect that 
culture emerged to prevent human intellect from enabling feral people to lose their aversion 
to death. Ted Kaczynskiâ€™s experience is an example of this happening. When he had spent enough time alone in his cabin, he said that he became okay with dying at any moment 
because he was happy with his life.
My interpretation of this is that he had sufficiently overcome his enculturation to the point 
where he was no longer being hurt by it. Since he wasnâ€™t hampered with the deprivation 
which culture imposes, he was not afraid of dying. In the past, the cultural reason why you 
couldnâ€™t kill yourself was because God said so. Or because it will continue some metaphysi-
cal cycle of suffering, or because your parents own your body and suicide is dishonorable. 
These days, the dominant cultural justification for life is this belief that you canâ€™t kill yourself 
because there are things that need to be accomplished in life. But you do not live for the 
achievement of your goals, you have goals so that you will continue to live and thus will 
continue to propagate life.
I used to distinguish between the fulfillment of cultural and feral values, but then I realized 
that feral values are just as coercive of a delusion as cultural values are. I still emphasize 
cultural so much because of how prominent it is, and once you understand that culture is a 
disease, you can recognize that life itself is a disease. The deprivation which results from the 
existence of both cultural and feral values are the only reason why anyone wants to live. Life 
is suffering, everyone has heard that statement, but they donâ€™t accept it at face value. They 
interpret it to mean that life has suffering, but life is suffering, and suicide is the solution.",1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensei is encouraging each one to cross train with people they've not seen before.

Over discipline and performance again. I think he made really valid points about the discipline in the Bde. Problem is not many people realise it till it's too late. When that happens, we all deserve the lecture we're getting. Even I realised my discipline slackened down. Before the Sun run at Selarang, I did take my own sweet time to get to camp even though I was already late. Instead we the juniors made the officers wait for us. Of course the weather was bad but still it didn't project a good image.

958176,Non-Profit,"       Oh no. They changed the format again. WHY? ARGH!  Anywayz dudez, it's really quiet over here and I'm lonely. Boo-freakin'-hoo. I've been keeping busy the past two days or so, and now that no one's here, there's a prominent and reverberating echo that follows me everywhere.  To sum things up...most of that time was occupied by  THE VIDEO .  Yesterday we went to Bi-Lo, where we filmed us defiling a can of peanut butter and putting it back on the shelf, and then looking at condoms and attempting to buy some and make it embarrasing as possible, all the while on film! We were throw out thereafter, tho.   So, thus pissed, we went to some nearby shrubs and did some damage. Seth jumped into them once and smacked his skateboard into the curb and fell into them...I did a stagedive on them, face first, whereafter I rolled out the front and was witnessed by a couple 'o people, but no cops. So we didn't get arrested and that was great.  We also filmed other stuff...it's pretty gross and I won't go into detail. But it's not us streaking (yet) so don't worry about it.  At home, Seth and I designed the logos for this production, which is called SF, which stands for either ShitFiend or StupidFriends, depending on the audience. But moreover, it can stand for whatever you want it to. We just like ShitFiend.   We also wrote a parody of Good Charlotte's  The Anthem  and a song making fun of Star Wars with an awesome porn music background. w00t w00t.  And THEN...it was the next morning, and battling a lot of rain, we managed to get Alex and Brooks over here. There were many preliminary stunts with fire...LOTS of stuff is flammable. Seth's hand, basketballs, his skateboard, the ground...if it was burnable, we burned it :) It was amazingly fun to watch; moreover it was a middle finger to the age old clich 'play with fire and you get burned'.  I  didn't get burned so HAH. Well, at least at this moment in the story.  Then, we had Brooks ride down the driveway on a scooter and got Alex to pelt him with a basketball. He had some impressive wounding from hitting the agregate. Alex did it to and we filmed it from a downhill perspective, with me, my sister, Brooks, and Seth throwing balls at him. He was also injured by this encounter tho not as much because he stuck to the grass. Mostly it was that getting hit in the head really hard part that made him wail.   AND THEN THE FIREWORKS. I had one more left in my house so we used that...I donned a new pair of jeans and took it in the right pocket, or so dictates tradition. We got it on film...it looks like I'm getting shot in the ass. I could watch it all day and never get tired of it. There's also the aftermath of me being on fire, where I take the hose and put myself out.   We later went to Brooks's house and got his MASSIVE box of fireworks. I said (very foolishly) that I would take ten in the back pockets. They argued my will to six, deeming me much too insane and wanting to preserve the lower part of my body for motor purposes...wheelchairs, people, wheelchairs, but they didn't listen...SO. Three in each pocket. Surprisingly they all lit and exploded...that it truly an assorted rarity in bunching bottlerockets.   Then, Alex threw one at me and it landed in my back pocket somehow...when it went off it streaked down to my ankle and blew.  And by the way...not any of that caused the burn.  The burn came from the last one. I told Brooks to give me one for the road and I filmed it myself. I don't know why but that one pwned me. I got a bit burnt so ouch. But it was all in the name of fun so 'smile all' to quote Rosie.   And remember, if I die, I die smiling, and that's what matters.  We also have some really awesome footage of me and Alex performing  Master of Puppets  and  Freedom . Seth is a pretty wykd fotographer.   Anyway kids...that's about it. Just thought I would give an update and tell everyone how dumb I'm being so the rest of you can feel that much smarter.  Peace.    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

942828,indUnk,"                  IT'S TOMMOROW !  St. Philip's Day, that is....   Here are the final prayer and meditation by Venerable John Henry Cardinal Newman, C.O. .....  '  May 25 Philip's Miraculous Gifts   Philip's great and solid virtues were crowned and adorned by the divine Majesty with various and extraordinary favours, which he in vain used every artifice, if possible, to hide.  It was the good-pleasure of God to enable him to penetrate His ineffable mysteries and to know His marvellous providences by means of ecstasies, raptures, and visions, which were of frequent occurrence during the whole of his life.  A friend going one morning to confession to him, on opening the door of his room softly, saw the Saint in the act of prayer, raised upon his feet, his eyes looking to heaven, his hands extended. He stood for a while watching him, and then going close to him spoke to himbut the saint did not perceive him at all. This state of abstraction continued about eight minutes longer; then he came to himself.  He had the consolation of seeing in vision the souls of many, especially of his friends and penitents, go to heaven. Indeed, those who were intimate with him held it for certain, that none of his spiritual children died without his being certified of the state of their souls.  Philip, both by his sanctity and experience, was able to discriminate between true and false visions. He was earnest in warning men against being deluded, which is very easy and probable.  Philip was especially eminent, even among saints, for his gifts of foretelling the future and reading the heart. The examples of these gifts which might be produced would fill volumes. He foretold the deaths of some; he foretold the recovery of others; he foretold the future course of others; he foretold the births of children to those who were childless; he foretold who would be the Popes before their election; he had the gift of seeing things at a distance; and he knew what was going on in the minds of his penitents and others around him.  He knew whether his penitents had said their prayers, and for how long they were praying. Many of them when talking together, if led into any conversation which was dangerous or wrong, would say: 'We must stop, for St. Philip will find it out.'  Once a woman came to him to confession, when in reality she wished to get an alms. He said to her: 'In God's name, good woman, go away; there is no bread for you'and nothing could induce him to hear her confession.  A man who went to confess to him did not speak, but began to tremble, and when asked, said, 'I am ashamed,'for he had committed a most grievous sin. Philip said gently: 'Do not be afraid; I will tell you what it was'and, to the penitent's great astonishment, he told him.   Such instances are innumerable. There was not one person intimate with Philip who did not affirm that he knew the secrets of the heart most marvellously.  He was almost equally marvellous in his power of healing and restoring to health. He relieved pain by the touch of his hand and the sign of the Cross. And in the same way he cured diseases instantaneouslyat other times by his prayersat other times he commanded the diseases to depart.  This gift was so well known that sick persons got possession of his clothes, his shoes, the cuttings of his hair, and God wrought cures by means of them.  Prayer  Philip , my holy Patron, the wounds and diseases of my soul are greater than bodily ones, and are beyond thy curing, even with thy supernatural power. I know that my Almighty Lord reserves in His own hands the recovery of the soul from death, and the healing of all its maladies. But thou canst do more for our souls by thy prayers now, my dear Saint, than thou didst for the bodies of those who applied to thee when thou wast upon earth. Pray for me, that the Divine Physician of the soul, Who alone reads my heart thoroughly, may cleanse it thoroughly, and that I and all who are dear to me may be cleansed from all our sins; and, since we must die, one and all, that we may die, as thou didst, in the grace and love of God, and with the assurance, like thee, of eternal life.

919128,Law,"             For an as-yet undiscovered reason, I am in a fairly solid financial situation this semester. I haven't really determined why, because even accounting for parental generosity, I'd still be in okay shape.    Note : Okay shape, for those of you who have jobs, means I can pay rent - nothing more. I'm not buying yachts or TVs (or even movies), I'm just not going to have to ask for much, if any, help from the parents this summer.  But the lack of financial stress--other than that looming $140,000 debt I have attached to my person as of next May--has given me a moment to consider my overall views on money. My complete disclosure before saying anything, of course, is that I've never been destitute and my family is comfortably upper-middle-class, at least nowadays.   When I have money, I spend it. I save it when something tells me I should (i.e. to afford vacations, or presumably when children are born to save for college) but otherwise, I have no attachment whatsoever to seeing lots of cash in my bank account. People don't often ask me for money, especially now that I'm living fat off the government, but when they do I've almost always given them whatever I could. I don't give out loans, though; approximately 90% of any financial assistance I've ever given has been given without a plea for repayment.  Along those lines, aside from large rent-paying checks or outright 'gifts' because of dire straits, most of what I do is pay for stuff. I don't mind picking up a check, if I can, especially when it's dinner for two or a movie or just... whatever. I wouldn't call it chivalry, because although it occurs with my female friends more often, that's simply because I have more female friends. In truth, I'm not sure why I operate that way, because at this point it's second nature. I certainly don't keep track of what I pay for (I mean, other than for my own bookkeeping purposes) so it's not about reciprocity either.  I guess in the end my point is this: save when necessary, but otherwise, don't be such a cheap bastard. Really, this applies to things beyond money (love, friendship, volunteering) but people seem to get super worked up about cash most of all. It's only temporary, and as long as you remain smart--no giving away your kid's orthodonture fund--it's a much less anxious way to live.  Oh, and stop asking for repayments of loans. If you give someone money, and you don't specifically sign a document detailing repayment, then when they don't repay you, just remember that for next time and call it a day. If it the money was that important to you, you should have been more careful to detail the terms of the transaction--but since you didn't, let it go.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

906582,Engineering,"                   And on to the subject of strip clubs      Now, I don't want to offend any of my friends who think differently, cuz I know there are some.  But I don't see anything wrong with strip clubs.  To be honest, I think ladies' night are far more degrading than the average peelers.  I think my bf was pretty proud of the fact that I had no problems going to the Speakeasy with him . . . until we found quite a few other couples who do the same thing.  In my opinion, naked women are more appealing to look at than naked men.  This certainly doesn't mean that I would rather take a girl home than a man - simply that the female form is just nicer. =)    At ladies' nights, the women are hootin' and hollerin' and making huge asses of themselves.  Not so at the peeler's.  Sure, there's some, but not to the extent that I've seen it in Dewey Steven's and the like.  For the most part, the women on stage look like they're enjoying themselves.  They're not being forced to dance, and they're making damn good money, too! =)  However, I'm only human, and on some days ('fat' days come to mind), I would rather not spend a Friday evening looking at women who are much prettier and skinnier than me.  You know, it's interesting how it's much more socially acceptable for women to do a lot of things men wouldn't even consider, sexually.  Let's start with the tame stuff.  It's perfectly OK for women to hug and flirt with and even kiss their friends.  I don't know many men that hug each other, let alone kiss.  It's just not done unless you're gay.  Women can compliment each other or make appreciative comments about goodlooking women without causing much commotion.    For the more adventurous, not many people will think a woman is disgusting or homosexual just because she's experimented on the same sex.  Yet that's the common opinion if it were a man doing the same thing.  I guess there are some pretty good things about being a woman. =)  Say, did anyone ever catch that Life Network show about switching genders?  Two men and two women spent two weeks or so creating a personality of the opposite sex and living as that person.  None of these people were considering changing their gender permanently or anything like that . . . it was just a human experiment.  It was crazy.  One of the girls cried when she had to have her hair cut . . . I don't blame her.  My hair is part of what makes me consider myself feminine.  Anyways, it was just interesting, and it made me think that I'm very happy being a woman and would never voluntarily change that!      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hopefully I'm smart enough to figure out the cell phone holder.  I'll take a picture of it in my car once I get it mounted.  (Yeah, I just said 'mounted'.

886442,Student,"             On the way back home from work, my bus, the company paid staff bus, passes through a long street along one side of which runs a cemetery. Whenever the traffic slows down on that particular street, I start reading the tombstones. Its an old cemetery, all occupied. Depending on the exact point the traffic slows down, you get a chance to view only so many stones. At the start of the road, there are the oldest tombs, with names and dates and what else written on them in Arabic. Then further up come the relatively younger tombs, say from the start of the century and this goes on till the other end of the road where you have the most recent ones the inhabitants of which deceased in the 90s.   Today, the traffic slowed down closer to the beginning of the road where the turn of the century stones stand. I saw this one stone which I have never recognized before. It belonged initially to a man who lived between 1902  1931. Died young. However, it also said on the stone that his beloved wife was buried there as well so that they could lie in each others arms for all eternity. The surprising thing was that the wife was buried in 1999. She was married to a man who died at the age of 29 and she outlived him 68 long years. 68 years of life without the man she loved, yet it appears that she never remarried and wished to be buried where he was. 68 years is longer than the life some get to live.   I thought about the type of life she may have had. Maybe she had given him children before his 29 years and maybe those children were her consolation for the remaining 68 years of her life. But again, maybe they were just married when he died and she did not even get to say good-bye. Maybe they were childhood sweethearts who married when they were still children and had no offspring. Who knows? I will try next time to see whether there are other stones nearby belonging to members of the same family. Maybe then will I get to learn more.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

883178,Fashion,"            Thats weird.   Today I folded and called the cable company to request hook-up.  Lest you think Im frivolous, I signed up for the most basic service (less than $10/month) so that I can get decent reception (I cant watch The O.C. in black and white with snow, yo).  I have guilt over all the DVDs I havent gotten around to watching, books I havent read, fresh air I havent had, and I think going without Comedy Central will open up about 17 hours in my week.  Anyway, I spoke with Glen (who was very helpful), and curiosity got the best of me.  I had to ask what the various levels of cable-dom would bring me.  Apparently, there are 3 levels of basic cable (wisely called 1, 2 and 3).  Im getting the first option.  Glen explained what channels are available for each option and when he mentioned Fox News (part of option #3, FYI), he editorialized that, if you like news, thats a really good channel.  Uhhh, thanks Glen, but Im doing just fine without Bill OReilly right now.  Point of the story is this I get nervous around people that are enthusiastic about Fox News.

878554,Accounting,"       Holy Shit  Last night was a night, I must admit. I was asked to be someone's wife. Oh yeah, I had a marriage proposal. This was not a drunk man in the corner bragging about my rack and how he would like to pull on my long hair. This was a guy that a year ago I was in a 3 year relationship with, a THREE year relationship. Ken and I went thru everything you could imagine and we had some tough times. I loved him then, and I still love him now. He said that now he had learned a few things since I had left, and he has grown quite a bit. He learned that he would have not done half the things he did, now. He told me that he knows in his heart that I am the only women that he wants to spend the rest of his life with. I am the only women that has made him happy. That he would be broke and living on the streets, it wouldn't matter if he had me. He would move anywhere I wanted and travel with me everywhere, as long as I was with him. He misses my hair all over, my dogs hair all over and my clothes all over the place. *he started to cry* I loved ken then and I love ken now, there has been no change in feelings towards him, I had just needed to get out at the time. Here is the twist, I am also in love with someone else. holy crap, fuck fuck fuck. I have never met anyone like this second one, god he is odd but very loavable, what do i do? They are diffrent from each other, so i have both sides to choose from, but damn if it does not make it harder. I am crazy.  I was a little upset that Thomas and Robert didnt come, or call!

I called my college and it turns out that from now on they only take four and fives and only after careful consideration from the lovely dean. Oh well. I just want the credit from my English and Psych tests i really don't care that much for statistics. Although if i get a three i will be happy because really that's all i want. I just want to be proficient in the darn test not like a masters or anything. The problems witht his test and me is 1) It's math 2)While i can learn math, what i've learned tends to leak a week from testing it 3) i didn't have such a great teacher 4) i wasn't such a great student and 5) which is really the one that brings me down, i have little knowledge of how to use my lovely calculator. Man five problems is bad. Well, i will take the test anyway hoping that i will pass. Then i will go home to re-read the stranger and Catcher in the Rye as well as going over any of my essays for Ap English. This will go on from tuesday to thursday and it shall be fun. I will go to aikido on wednesday because well i can't not go for 2 days that's just horrible. I'm not going today becayse of math studying which i need a lot of but i am doing nothing on. Instead i am reading and writing some really good short stories and just little poetic lines that will some day make their way in to some published articles.

Cause if they  really  didn't care what people thought of them, they wouldn't be anouncing it to the world. When people say they don't care what people think of them, all they really want is for people to think that they are the type of person who doesn't care what people think of them. But that's not really the type of person they are. Because obviously, they want people to think that they are a certain type of person.

I had to guess the category based on the clues - if you get it on the first clue you get 500; if it takes you more than one, you get 250.  I got it on the first clue... the clue was - 'Meredith Vieira'.  Any guesses on the category?    April Fool's!   Happy April Fool's Day!  Have you gotten fooled yet?  I kinda have - indirectly.   They played a trick on Sarah (the morning show host on Alice) and it kinda tricked me too....

861706,indUnk,"             In college I once had an assignment where I had to interview someone over the age of 50, about pretty much anything that was pertinent to when and where they lived.  So I decided to talk to one of Chris' uncles about his experiences in the Vietnam War, a subject I've always been somewhat interested in.  If I remember correctly, I got an 'A' on the assignment.   Roy Lansdale may be in his fifties, but he is still a robust, strong man.  He has gray hair, and large work hardened hands.  No stranger to hard work, he has worked as a bricklayer a large portion of his life, and has also worked in the oil fields.  In March of 1968, as a young man, he was drafted into the military, where he worked in communications.  Exactly a year later, in March 1969, he volunteered to go to Vietnam, where he did artillery work.  Artillery is a long-distance battle, so he didnt see much action, that was the infantry.  One thing he did see was the South Vietnamese people.  He saw how they lived, and how the war affected their lives   KU:What was your opinion on the war?  Do you think we should have been over there, or do you think we should have stayed out?  RL:Vietnam wasnt nothing but a big money war, between the big companies and stuff.  Actually, we should have never got over there, unless they were gonna finish it, which would have been easy to have done, but the big companies didnt want it to finish because they were making too much money off of it.  Wed go pick up supplies, and youd see these big blocks, around the VA and stuff, and youd see lumber sitting out there rotting.  Cokes, cans of beer and stuff, back then they were in the tin cans, and theyd just sit out there and rust.  It was all a big money war  We had to get rid of our own trash and stuff.  We made sure there wasnt nothing in it of any importance.  I seen them put those pint, um, quart deals of milk right out by the barrel, during the burning of some of the trash, it would turn the cartons black, sitting around that barrel.  Wed take lard and butter and stuff, the big gallon cans, theyd open them up and push the lid down in there.  Wed hauled it off one day, and, the boys went to unload it, and the [South] Vietnamese was unloading it.  And they was just reaching their hands down in that butter and lard and stuff, and eating it, and they was drinking that milk, with it being burnt like that.  And you know it had to be ruined, because it was ruined when they set it out there.  And of course, being by that barrel and stuff, the heat didnt help it.  I actually seen them drink it, and run their hands and stuff down in that butter and lard and eating it.  And theyd cut their hands on them lids that were smashed down in there, and theyd bleed in it and just still be eating it.  The butter and stuff, of course, I guess, you know, wasnt ruined, but you know how that stuff just gets tasting old.  It was sickening to sit there and watch them drinking that milk and stuff.  They had to have had iron stomachs; I couldnt even stand the smell of it.  You didnt have to use the dump; theyd unload it, looking for stuff, you know.  There was a big hole in the ground you were supposed to dump in, but you didnt get the chance, because they were always looking through the stuff you threw away, so that was the reason you didnt throw anything of importance away.  You just threw away stuff that was literally trash. It shows you what kind of country they were, they werent totally developed yet, what youd call developed.  The South Vietnamese, actually, were good people, they were just poor people.  KU:Following up on that, what were the living conditions like for the South Vietnamese?  What effects did the war have on the regular people?  RL:Like the farmers?  Well, I dont know, really what effect it had, but it would keep them from developing.  Because if they did grow anything that the Vietnamese that lived there didnt need, they [The North Vietnamese] would take it away from them, because there wasnt that many ARVNs, or South Vietnamese soldiers there to protect them.  So theyd just come through there and take what they wanted.  What you seen was just all rice paddies, over where we was at there was a lot of them. I seen them out there making hooches one time, had a mud hole out there and theyd throw straw in it, and walk around on it, and mix that straw and mud up and make their hooches out of it.  They lived in dirt floors, mud houses and stuff, which over there was probably about as cool as you could get.  But you didnt see no dogs over there either.  [Laughing] Its just something that you have to experience.  Youre covering basically good people.   Like I said, they were what I guess youd call undeveloped  They kept to themselves really.  The North Vietnamese, and Im not sure, but I think some of the Koreans had something to do with it, because youd see one of them mixed in with them North Vietnamese soldiers once in a while.  Basically it just all came down to a big money war for the big shots to make money off of.  Especially [President] Johnson.  KU:  Yeah, Ive heard people say that before  RL:It was, you could sit over there and see things go to waste Youd see them [the South Vietnamese soldiers] running up and down the roads with new guns and cannons and stuff, and wed be sitting there,  I was in charge of communications and we were supposed to have a Jeep, and a three-quarter, and a deuce-and-a-half, and I think we just had a deuce-and-a-half.  The Vietnamese were running down the road with new trucks, new guns.  Our M-60 for guard duty was so bad you could bump it and itd go off even when it was on safety.  As a matter a fact, one of our guys got killed by it  He made a mistake and sat down in front of that gun, and one of the guys on guard duty with him bumped that gun, and it went off and shot him in the back and killed him.  There was a lot of casualties caused by your own country.  We couldnt get nothing, they gave it all to the Vietnamese.  They called us police action, [laughing] we were policemen.  If theyd called it a war it wouldnt have lasted long.  They wouldnt do it.    KU:Were you ever in or around any major battles, the Tet Offensive or anything like that?  RL:No, we werent in that area.  Like I said, I was in artillery  They knew when they was coming in and stuff.   Artillery could pretty well hold them off if they knew they were coming.  They had shells youd shoot and theyd explode and fan out with little bitty darts, like needles.  You didnt want to get in front of them, regardless of where you was at, whether you was on the ground or  Perry said he found some sometimes people would be pinned to trees with them.  KU:My uncle was in Vietnam, and he stepped on something like that, a mine that shot shrapnel everywhere.  It messed up his right arm, he couldnt use it very well, and he had to have a glass eye.  [We got off the subject for a while, it turns out he worked with my grandfather in the oil fields and used to be friends with my uncle and my father when they were young.  So we ended up talking about family for a while, but eventually got back on subject.]  RL:That place messed up a lot of guys minds.  It didnt bother me too much, we did ours from a distance and we didnt get to see a lot of victims.  Every once in a while wed have a little bit of trouble but nothing much.  Just what they called keep you honest.  Throw in a few rounds once in a while.  I was always kinda scared the whole time we was over there, cause he had a big pit full of gas over there.  Of course, they were in these rubber bladders that would stop a lot of it, but if a round had ever hit that it would have busted one of them and it wouldve went off and it would have been hot.  Like I said, I was lucky, I didnt see a whole lot.  Just enough to know that I didnt want to either.  KU:Did you see anything over therelike anything that really bothered you?  RL:Occasionally you know, but the worst was when that gun went off and killed that guy.  I was in charge that night.  It kinda bothered me, it also bothered me that we didnt have the equipment good enough to take care of ourselves.  So it all falls back to money.  RL:Basically we had good people, everybody tried to look after one another, but youd run into an asshole once in a while.  We had this E6 once that tried to pull rank all the time, but it didnt do him a lot of good We got along pretty good with everybody, except for one drill sergeant.  Me and him got into it cause he wanted me to do a bunch of pushups, we had been marching two or three miles with all that gear on, and it was hurting my shoulders where I tore the cartilage one time.  We get back and for no reason at all, he wanted me to do pushups and I just laid there and I told him that my shoulder hurt and I wasnt going to do a damn thing.  So we went over to the captain and the captain said something and the drill sergeant didnt like it and he tried to push me down and I threw him over my shoulder so that was about the end of it.    KU:You talked about it messing with peoples minds, and Ive heard that there was a lot of drug use over there that also contributed to it.  RL:There was.  I didnt see a lot of it, but I saw a little.  They didnt have a lot of drugs, but they had one over there it was called liquid speed, and it would screw you up.  And if they could get marijuana, a lot of them would get on that stuff.  Some of them would get caught and theyd make them go back to the main base, and stay there  Most of them you didnt want them around anyway, cause they could get somebody hurt.    KU:When you got back there were a lot of anti-war protests and a lot of anger against returning soldiers.  Did you ever encounter any of that?  RL:I never encountered any of that, I heard about it but never encountered any of it.  We had around that Fort Benning in that honor guard we went over there and trained for riot control because they were having that plus all the black stuff in 68 and 69, and we were training for riot control.  I think that worried me worse than going to Vietnam, you know.  What do you do with your own people?  We was lucky that things settled back down, and then I went over seas.  Then they had that one college where four or six of them got killed, thats kinda what I was afraid of.  Thats what worried me so much.  They train you for it, but theres nothing, nothing about something going different, nothing ever goes like youre trained for.  But that was one thing I was proud to quit before we had to do it.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm so bored that I'm actually watching  King of the Hill , and I hate that show.  I've just been sitting at home all day, I haven't even left the house.  FX was having a  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  marathon earlier, so I spent a few hours watching that.  I've got a really bad headache now for some reason.  Last night at work wasn't too bad, in fact it was kinda fun.  Last night was Halloween for Purcell, because there's a big football game tonight, so we celebrated Halloween last night.  I think that's incredibly stupid, but they've done that several times before.  Work wasn't as busy as it usually is on Halloween, and it's was kinda fun, since most of the employees were in costume.  I didn't wear a costume, I just told people I was the disgruntled employee that's going to kill everyone.  Alicia was a Fairy Princess, or something like that, and Daniel was Drew Carey.  He looked exactly like him, it was funny.  I don't know what Stacy was, she didn't even know for sure, she was just wearing this really cool dress.  She said it was supposed to be Goth looking, but they were out of black, so she bought a red one.  She looked more like some kind of princess or something.  She looked good, whatever she was.  Stacy's cool, except every time I work with her I always get that damn 'Stacy's Mom' song stuck in my head.  I think I'm gonna go look at porn now.  Hooray for porn.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
861706,indUnk,"             Cold out there today.  As soon as I typed that, I instantly thought of that episode of  Family Guy  where they get relocated to the south in the Witness Protection Program, and Stewie's sitting on the porch with a banjo with a bunch of old men, and he says, 'Hot out there today.  Yup.  Hot out there every day.'  And then they all start playing banjo jugband music.  So anyway, it's really cold today, and yesterday, and every day, at least for a while.  It was in the high twenties most of the day yesterday, and it snowed most of the day, but there wasn't any accumulation, and the roads never froze no matter how wet they got, because the ground temperature was still around 50.  There's just a little white dusting on the grassy areas.  Today it's only 15 degrees, the last time I saw the temperature.  It's supposed to get up to 37 today, 45 tomorrow, and then the next five days after that, the highs are all going to be between 30 and 34.  Me and Chris are working on some new shirt designs.  He's telling me things he wants to buy a t-shirt of, and I'm making them.  At his request, I also put the 'you rode the short bus' image on a BBQ Apron, because he's going to buy it.  It will be a few days before I get the new shirts up though, because I've still got to break out my PaintShop Pro and make the images.  And now I have to go, I've still got to do all that banking stuff today.  Then I have to go to Best Buy to buy a USB adapter thingy if I can find one.

Sunday we trailered Al and Sy up to Todd's since he has an indoor ring. OMG was that eventful. Al was flipping out from the trailer. Long story, but we got there and back safely so it was good. Then that night we rented Seabiscuit and Crossroads and stayed at home, since it was snowing.  Monday we went to the mall again with another one of Mandy's friends. And then I went home.  Yep, it was a nice weekend. Tuesday was school and then that night I got pissed at my parents because they don't think I shoudl go to the Central/ND game next week since 'my grades aren't good enough'. Grr... And then today I was really sick so I stayed home. Tonight we're supposed to go have dinner since Charles's bday is tomorrow, but I'm going to stay home.  Guess that's all for now.

855133,Communications-Media,"                  Return of the Cynic   I'm back in Philly. I didn't realize how much I love this city. I still want Portland, Ore., but Los Angeles is a horrible city.  Not that I didn't enjoy my time there, but I wouldn't recommend a visit unless you have a driver. The Getty Musuem was amazing, and I didn't even get much to the collection. The building itself was fascinating.  I'll have plenty more on that and, of course, the war in Iraq.   Yes, I'm happy the people are free. As I've been saying, it'd have been better if the people did it themselves or had a larger part.   A CNN story this morning noted U.S. forces were working to expel Kurds (a native Iraqi group) from a city they had taken control of.  It should also be noted that without WMDs, this war is still illegitimate. Resolution 1441 and all the others did not give the United States or any nation the power to wage war to liberate the Iraqi citizenry.  Citizens are held to the law, and the United States should be held up to the law equally.  I only mention this because support for the war has grown, even as it failed at its objective and could end up being illegal.  Unfortunately, the Bush administration and media are playing a bit much to emotions and less to intelligence.  Believe me, I've got plenty to go on about the media as well.  But until then, it's already back to work in the drearier city of Philadelphia.             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
853818,BusinessServices,"       Hello blog, my old friend - I've come to talk to you again ...  Well, it's been a while - I signed up for this thing ages ago and never got started on it properly, but reading a couple of regular blogs has inspired me to start it up again. Writing is one of the things that I would like to do more of (along with exercise) and writing a few words every day seems like a good place to start. I have been meaning to write some game reviews for ugvm magazine, but haven't found the necessary circular tuit to actually do them yet. Perhaps if I have to give an account of my progress here I will be shamed into getting them done? On the other hand, it could be like my timesheets for work which are largely, errm, fictional - a frightening portion of my working day is spent staring into space before I actually knuckle down and do what I am supposed to at the last possible minute.   Anyhoo, there are two things to recount today.   This morning, I fell off the wagon of vegetarianism after nearly twenty years and succumbed to a bacon sarnie. Jan cooks bacon on a Sunday morning for the kids and after resisting for several years I gave in and ate one. It was flipping gorgeous. I felt slightly guilty afterwoods, and wondered why. I'm not really an ethical vegetarian or a particularly health conscious one - it's more of a habit, and a matter of taste I suppose. I'll have to find a source of free range happy bacon and eat that.  At teatime we all went for a walk in the woods with Barney the dog. It's fabulous in Foxfield Spring woods at the moment - the bluebells form a shimmering purple carpet with lime green tree shoots poking through. The bird song is a surround sound treat, particularly first thing in the morning. There is a woodpecker in residence at the top end of the woods and it's knocking sounds exactly like the noise that the Predator makes in the eponymous films and video games.  Anyhoo, Barney is a nervous dog, and not particularly well trained. He stays on the lead when we are out and I reel him in to keep him under control when other dogs are around. He came from the RSPCA and we don't really know what sort of experiences he has had. Just as we were at the entrance to the woods a medium sized brown whippet ran up and started nipping at Barney. It didn't have a collar on and there was no sign of the owner, until a fifty something woman came round the corner shortly after.  'Is this your dog?' I asked 'Only, it should have a collar on and be under control'  'It's a whippet - it has a harness, not a collar and anyway it's your dog that's not under control'  She then proceeded to have a go at me for being a newcomer to the area 'I've lived here 38 years and I've never seen you before' (when I've walked twice a day in those woods for the last three and a half years), and how ridiculous it was that I should have my dog on a lead and that it was somehow my fault for her dog being out of control.  The icing on the cake, as it were, was the shit on the path.  The dog settled down for a nice leisurely dump in the middle of the path, as it's rude and obnoxious owner walked away.  I couldn't help myself - 'Excuse me, your dog has just defecated on the path!' I shouted in my best, plummy, outraged middle class voice. Cue much hilarity from my family, as Jan escorted me away and got me to calm down a little.              ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
853818,BusinessServices,"       It's chucking it down with rain here at the moment, but the heat hasn't really abated so it is still rather humid. The woods tonight were a little like a tropical rainforest with rain pattering through the foliage, but unfortunately the local gang of neds had chosen tonight to stand in the downpour shouting at each other again. Why do they do this? Are their lives so devoid of excitement that getting wet and making grunting noises is a preferable alternative?

I'm not talking about picking up at clubs, when you're slightly tipsy from the long island teas you've had. I'm talking about being stone cold sober and working up the courage to 'just do it!'  I for one, will be first to admit that I have a very bad case of the chicken shits. It never seems that diffucult when you think about it, it can be summarised into 3 simple steps: Step1: Walk up to the person Step 2: Say hi Step 3: Ask him out But somehow, no matter how confident I am in other areas, I'll be reduced to a stammering, bumbling glob of insecurity in front of said person. Its really very sad when you think about it. The femminist movement has garnered us the right to vote, make our own babies, go to school, and do whatever the hell we want and some of us still can't get over the chicken shits.

814486,Internet,"             That Pink concert last night was wicked! I've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. There was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in French) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to Pink. It's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. She even spoke some French during the concert, like: 'Bonsoir, je m'appelle Pink, enchanté!' which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. The concert was in Juan-Les-Pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! We actually got a ride down with Billou, James and Jeannine (James' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top Audi A4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... The trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. But still, one wicked evening. I wish we'd gone to that David Guetta live performance down in La Siesta night-club last weekend... I'm sure he'll back back next year.      Jogged/ran into work again this morning. You know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. For example, last night when we got back from the concert, I shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did I think that it might be raining in the morning... And you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... That's one of the great things about this place!      Just got back now from lunch. Went down to Cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. The French aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. Surprising really, when you see how many French people order 'steak tartare' for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those 'aquired tastes' you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!      If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber 'maki' (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna 'maki', like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or 'fatty tuna' (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.      OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see 'I, robot' tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

794491,Arts,"         PATRIOT , MEET JOE MCCARTHY   Freedom of speech, it's a bitch, isn't it?  The truth is,  Patriot , that if you really want to celebrate American values, and if you really want to exude true patriotism, then you, my friends, need to celebrate every single word said by those with whom you disagree, whether it be Shingavi or anyone else.  Unfortunately, the Patriot's ' urlLink news analysis ' of the 9/11 events shows us, on their part, a level of tolerance of dissent that rivals the Ayatollah (one of Ronald Reagan's favorite business partners).  One line that had me dusting off my makeup kit to bust out my Khmer Rouge:   ...the term 'student voices' does, in no way, encourage, necessitate, or justify the eruption of politically charged speeches or  dissident behavior  which occurred. (italics Brendan's)   Did I just read the phrase 'dissident behavior'?  Next thing you know, the  Patriot  is going to publish a list of names.  Eight years of conservatives trying not only to blame President William Jefferson Clinton for any and every problem on the globe, but also to relentlessly assault Clinton with baseless accusations about his personal and professional life, and suddenly criticizing Bush is considered 'dissident behavior'?  The  Patriot  either has an incredibly short memory or an incredibly large pair of cojones.  I'm starting to see what looks like a childish obsession that the  Patriot  has with Snehal Shingavi.  Because they're such an immature and uninformed publication, the boys and girls at the  Patriot  know that the only fight they could possibly, possibly win, as conservatives, is against the most extreme elements of the Berkeley left that there are.  Snehal was right about the 12th being a day of war rhetoric from Dubya.  However, he didn't even have to wait that long.  Bush's speech at Ellis Island on the night of the 11th was a somber requiem for about 90 seconds, and then suddenly veered into very thinly-veiled words of war on Iraq.  Just a couple days after the Administration admitted that there is no link between Hussein and Al Qaeda, Bush had them joined at the hip in his speech.  Indeed, this was a 'politically charged speech' on 9/11.  So  Patriot , if you are consistent in any way, you must also add some critical words for Bush's politicization of 9/11, right next to Snehal and anyone else.  Nevermind the planned Cheney appearance on Limbaugh, hehe.  Something wrong with the United Nations flag?  Guess you've been reading too many of those 'Left Behind' books!  Two facts: 1) The UN headquarters is in... New York!, and more importantly, 2) people from many different countries died in the September 11th attacks, not just Americans.  But above all that, perhaps the flag was there in mourning.  This past year has given America the best chance it has had in a long time to become a fully responsible member of the global community, but now we see arrogance all over the place; Bush's unilateral Iraq rhetoric, not even the slightest push for renewable energy sources and alternative fuels from this administration, our continuing oil addiction, continued nose-thumbing at the Kyoto treaty, I could go on.  If the  Patriot  wants to criticize people for not being 'responsible', they need look no further than 1600 Pennsylvania.  The 'analysis' did get one thing exactly right.  The events described in the piece do constitute 'typical Berkeley style'.  For almost 40 years, UC Berkeley has been an institution where the questioning of both assumptions and authority has been strongly encouraged, and this was consistent with that spirit.  There were thousands of ceremonies across America that were somber and solemn, but at Berkeley that shoe doesn't quite fit, and the  Patriot  is just gonna have to live with that fact.

Could they come up with nothing else thats got no bread in it?  Are raisins and beets really traditional Jewish foods?  I mean, it wasnt ham, but still.

Despite each of them already being married, and despite that due to Rehnquist's advanced age, once he got down on one knee he needed medical assistance to get back up, the wedding is expected to occur next Thursday in the Rose Garden.  Because they are both Justices, they can override the usual laws about bigamy, as well as the usual blood test requirements, since taking any blood from either of them  would cause the stock market to collapse for no apparent reason other than to finish this sentence.  Justice Antonin Scalia remarked, 'I am so happy for Sandy and Bill.  May they make many children together, despite their advanced age.'  Clarence Thomas will reportedly supply cans of soda for the guests; Orrin Hatch will provide the musical entertainment; Strom Thurmond will regretfully be unable to attend due to his recent death. See, that wouldn't be very believable.  Perhaps if I wrote about something obscure enough, no one would doubt it.

Instead of sitting in your assigned seat... MOVE ONE SEAT TO THE LEFT! 5. Spend the whole class looking like you're typing your notes... BUT NEVER TURN THE COMPUTER ON! 6. Bring the right casebook... TO THE WRONG CLASS! 7. Don't do the reading... UNLESS YOU'RE ON PANEL! 8. Replace the professor's white chalk with a piece of... COLORED CHALK! 9. Show up to class... THREE AND A HALF MINUTES LATE! 10. Go up to the professor after class... AND ASK HIM A STUPID QUESTION YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER TO!      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

778441,Technology,"            LitKwiz  Reading is one thing I like the most. I can read anything and everything. There was a time when I used to eat books...  (now... due to limited time I've had to go on a diet, so to speak) . I've once attempted the near impossible task of reading three books in one night... and succeeded!!  (The three books I read in one night were the books in the Bourne trilogy by Robert Ludlum) . Such is my passion for reading. I'll list out a few of my favourite books some other time when I have the time and the inclination to do so.  Another of my most favourite activities is  Quizzing ... be it simple trivia, general knowledge, literature, music, sports... I like to create and solve quizzes on just about anything.  Today, I combine these two passions of mine and post a quiz based on literature. It consists of 10 questions. Each question contains the starting lines of some famous work of literature ... (some classic... some not so classic) . You have to identify the  name of the book  and the  name of the author  of that book.  The questions are simple... so take the quiz... and post your answers in the comments box. So here goes...  1.' What can you say about a 25 year old girl who died?'  2. 'Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.'  3. 'The great fish moved silently through the night water, propelled by short sweeps of its crescent tail.'  4. 'The drought had lasted now for ten million years, and the reign of the terrible lizards had long since ended.'  5. 'Amerigo Bonasera sat in New York Criminal Court Number 3 and waited for justice; vengeance on the men who had so cruelly hurt his daughter, who had tried to dishonor her.'  6. 'Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loin.'  7. 'Call me Ishmael.'  8. 'All children, except one, grow up.'  9. 'Most motorcars are conglomerations (this is a long word for bundles) of steel and wire and rubber and plastic, and electricity and oil and gasoline and water, and the toffee papers you pushed down the crack in the back seat last Sunday.'  10. 'It was seven o'clock of a very warm evening in the Seeonee hills when Father Wolf woke up from his day's rest, scratched himself, yawned, and spread out his paws one after the other to get rid of the sleepy feeling in their tips.'

Handing my try to ladies in hair nets was so much easier.  So was scooping out salad from a big bowl.  Burners......oven...heat....what a concept. I have mastered a few meals that keep me alive and not starving.  One, I thought, was pasta.  Oh so easy, oh so thought free.  Just boil and heat.  Oh no.... Lately I have been making a lot of pasta and just fridging it so I can just nuke it later.  So this afternoon I was boiling water, then put a whole box of pasta in.  Usually it takes about 10 minutes.  About 30 minutes later Karen came in telling me that she thinks that my pasta is done.  Oh it was done.... Screw it, I drain the wilted water sogged bits of pasta and put it in the fridge.  After hours in the TV studio I was starving... So I take out the pasta container and all the pasta kind of form together into a brick like shape.  So I cut myself a square and ate. How the hell have a survived a year independent?!?!

772682,Arts,"           so Jen wrote this today and I figure I will let you read and I will comment on it because it relates to what i was going to write about....  Tuesday, February 25, 2003 Posted 3:41 AM by Jen  Producers learn never to take anything for granted. Having enough people to operate a show for instance, is never a given. Tonight we had five people as crew and two of them had to be on camera at times. You never take equipment working for granted. Even the most simplistic of machines, like a VCR, could spaz out at any moment and leave you as helpless as if you had no cameras at all. They decided to freak out tonight, with 7 minutes until show we discovered they weren't taping video and by luck Whitney noticed a switch was in a different spot on one vcr than the other. However, we couldn't get it to stop playing spastically as if it needed tracking, which we didnt know how to fix. Andy had to go on air and apologize after the commercial breaks for anyone that just had a seizure due to the flashing colors and moving picture. Most importantly, you never take time for granted. I remember Miranda had a blog ages ago saying that since time is such a priority in production that she tended to see her life in a countdown, like she had 38 minutes until class, and 2 to get dressed in and 4 to eat in and so on. Kinda like how Will saw everything as units of time in About a Boy, but I won't go into that again :) I missed the lesson on managing time, but I think I have an appreciation for it of some sort. I hate going to bed because there's so many other productive things I could be doing, but I treasure my 1.29 hours of naptime if I ever get them. An hour wait for food means an hours worth of social time before hand. Maybe its not the time I'm concerned with, maybe its the rationalization of it. I can rationalize not doing anything for that hour because I'm waiting for food. I can rationalize taking a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before, which I can rationalize by saying staying up late was worth it because I got to write in my blog or talk to Scott or look at that website or play that game that I normally woudln't have had the time for. It sucks to get in an argument with me because I can rationalize anything in the world. I can rationalize the fact that the show didn't go as smoothly as we all would have liked because it wasn't my fault the vcr's turned schizo on us and we worked through the setbacks to put out a good show. Because in a year, no one's going to remember the technical problems we had, they'll just remember the manatee wanted to have sex with Andy, and in the end, that's all that matters...  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Well first off, my OCD would only allow me to count down anything with a zero or five, but besides that... it is true, working with television and radio, everything is a countdown and it all has to do with numbers.  Everything is perfectly timed.  In all aspects.  It always reminds me of the movie Castaway....'We live by the clock and we die by the clock'.  Numbers are all too important to me.  And I guess it just goes with me nature of packing all of my day with something.  Anything.  Epler pointed out that I 'don't deal with with being idle' haha.  It's been like that for years.  Sleep is only a luxury because there is just too much to get done, enjoy, and experience.  I rarely know what the word 'downtime' means.  I guess that is why I was so glad to actually get that snow storm, my life was forced to take a break.  Which is my perfect segway into my weekend....Don't have any regrets and use up your time to the fullest extent.... So I had some free time from work so Aurora and I decided to go to.....NORTH CAROLINA!   We left rainy cold Delaware at noon on Sunday.  From DE to North Carolina there are ONLY 3 signs for a Wawa at the exit.  And all are around Richmond.  There are two after Richmond.  Sadness!  We get to UNCW to visit Sean around 8:30 that night.  Go out to eat and hang out and fall asleep around 5am.  Aurora and I have been sick since Harrisburg (damn, was that ONLY a week ago!?!?!?!) so the coughing and sneezing and rough voices were quite appealing I'm sure.  We leave for Carrboro in the evening.  Jonasay and Graham Colton.  See we had to go, how often would they be playing together?!?!  I had my voice while Aurora had a sexy rendition of hers which didn't allow her to whisper very well so it was difficult to talk about people or make fun of anyone without being obvious.  But I think we succeeded.  Aside from Michael and his vagueness it was a very fun night.  We'll figure this one out...... Leave at 2 am to come back home to Delaware.  I taught Aurora stick shift so we could switch off.  After stopping at a random gas station filling up on coffee and Mountain Dew, I caught my second wind near Richmond and kept on going.  Cruise control is a very nice thing to have.  Saw the skies change from night to day and it reminded me on how much I love driving and being out while everything else is asleep.  Haha actually the last time one of those instances stick out is after I was at the beach in July with Jonasay and trekking on the beach...odd how everything comes around full circle.  Hit rush hour traffic in DC around 5:30 am.  Two sleeping cranky girls does not make the roadways safe!  Damn people.  Accident in Baltimore.  Made it home by 8 am.

Alas, the couple was caught in the act and they were hit with some misdemeanor charges and a good deal of embarassment.

769066,indUnk,"       Wretchard at  urlLink Belmont Club   urlLink concluded an article about his generally optimistic tone about events in Fallujah  in the following way: That is the state of play. And within that web of doubt America must grapple with a single burning certainty: that unless it can bring a functioning democracy to the Middle East and militarily defeat the terrorist threat it will find its very national existence threatened. Optimism is a word for nothing left to lose. Is the Battle of Iraq in particular and the War Against Radical Islam in general really that important? Is this really a war of national survival?   Daniel Pipes thinks so.  urlLink In an interview published on his site   He forecasts: 'There will be more attacks by Islamists on Americans. I can say this confidently because so many signs point in this direction. These assaults will awaken people. I expect it to be a one-way process of what I call education by murder. I do expect ever more Americans to worry; contrarily, I do not expect to hear many say, 'Well, I used to be worried about the threat of militant Islam, but no longer.' As time passes and more events occur, their assessment will become more realistic. Information such as  urlLink this article in  The Washington Post   would tend to butteress such claims. Indeed, at the end of this article, which discusses attempts by members of al Qaeda cells in Britain and France to create and use the deadly toxin Ricin, an expert in chemical and biological terrorism comments, 'These are toxins that, if released in a enclosed space, could cause extreme harm,' said Jeffrey M. Bale, an expert on chemical and biological terrorism at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. 'There's no doubt that the groups we're seeing today could carry out such an attack. What surprises me is that that they haven't already done so.'    Update, 5/7/04: This entry is so fragmentary, but I never seem to find time to get back to it.

It's a really short distance (~15 miles according to Mapquest) and should theoretically be a fast drive over (~16 minutes according to Mapquest again).     Instead... it takes usually about 35-45 minutes to get to work from home each morning.  That's on a good day too! If there's an accident, it's an hour easily! So today, I woke up fairly early, watched the news to see if there were any accidents, and even waited a bit for traffic to die down.  I left around 9:20am... stop...go...stop...go.

I'm a hands on person...I want to learn from my own mistakes, not everyone else's. I can accept making mistakes; I mean, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. I can live my own life, and I like that. Mistakes help people to learn, and often, they can make you a better person. And I know that first hand...because I've made mistakes, and I know better for next time. But there are things out there that I haven't done, and if I want to go out and do whatever I feel like, then so be it. I don't want people trying to stop me...if it's a mistake, I'll learn. But that's better than going through life just wondering...and not really knowing. I mean, what if something that I never did wouldn't have been a mistake? What if my only mistake was trying to avoid that 'mistake'? I want to live life first-hand, not have other people live it for me. I think people should live more like that. I mean, I want to see every aspect, be every person, do everything, make EVERY mistake. Because then, I'll know who I really am, and what I really want to do with my life.

734562,Arts,"           Gusev Crater, Tarus 23, XXVI (MPI) -- A spokesthing for Mars Air Force denounced as false rumors that an alien space craft crashed in the desert, outside of Ares Vallis on Saturday.   Appearing at a press conference today, General Rgrmrmy The Lesser stated that 'the object was, in fact, a harmless high-altitude weather balloon, not an alien spacecraft'.   The story broke late Saturday night when a major stationed at nearby Ares Vallis Air Force Base contacted the Gusev Crater Daily Record with a story about a strange, balloon-shaped object which allegedly came down in the nearby desert, 'bouncing' several times before coming to a stop, and 'deflating in a sudden explosion of alien gases.'   Minutes later, General Rgrmrmy contacted the Daily Record telepathically to contradict the earlier report. General Rgrmrmy stated that hysterical stories of a detachable vehicle roaming across the Martian desert were blatant fiction, provoked by incidences involving swamp gas. But the general public has been slow to accept the Air Force's explanation of recent events, preferring to speculate on the 'other-worldly' nature of the crash debris. Conspiracy theorists have condemned Rgrmrmy's statements as evidence of 'an obvious government cover-up,' pointing out that Mars no longer has any swamps.   They point to the release of secret government memos detailing attempts to discredit reports of the landings by alien space craft.   Local residents, like Driv Rhodo, who lives in the area of the alleged landings, are even more skeptical. 'I seen it with my own 5 eyes' claimed Rhodo last week. 'I've lived here over 300 years, most of my adult life-form. Them things used to be few and far between but lately they come in every few years or so.

I had a 40 gig hard drive, and it was full (like, less than 100 megs free, with no games or anything installed) thanks to my gloriously fast cable internet. I bought an 80 gig drive to bring my total giggage up to 120, allowing me to pirate software with wild abandon (come get me, BSA biatches!). and I got a 16x dvd and a 32X12X48 cdrw and another 128 meg stick of ram (bringing me up to 320 megs). So my ide bus is full up, no room at the inn, standing room only... then my system sat for a while, with me hammering on the poor 80 gig, until a couple days ago. a couple days ago I got: a GeForce 4 MX 440, some (cheap) flat panel speakers with a subwoofer, and a compact flash card reader. I got the reader because I was tired of having to plug in my damned camera and drain the batteries while I waited umpteen minutes to get all my random pictures of spots on the ground on disk. This reader acts as a removeable drive (drive J:, in my case) and I can just pop in mr. flash card and drag the aforementioned pictures onto the disk. I also got another 64 meg compact flash card, so I can have twice as many pictures of spots on the ground. Next on the list is the cpu, but thsi will be a bit pricey, as I want to upgrade to an athlon xp, and I'll have to buy the cpu, motherboard, and some ddr ram before I can run it. but oh well, I have time....

Hey, If I got shot 30,000 times, would I be a tragedy? I mean, when one person dies, the news doesn't seem to care as much as when somebody kills off a whole big group of people. So if I was to get kshot enough times to kill a whole herd of people, would I qualify as a tragedy? What if I made up a new religion right before I got killed? would I be a martyr then?

718029,Non-Profit,"       July 3, 2004  Yes, they really are. Now, I hardly pretend to be Einstein. Certainly there are folks out there who reveal handily that I am woefully under-informed on a wide variety of subjects when compared with a genuine intellect. But, really – is it too much to expect that every adult know the difference between “accept” and “except”? If you don’t readily understand the proper place to use the words “insure”, “ensure” and “assure”, then you need to crack a fucking book more often. Contractions, punctuation, word choice and basic grammar may bore you to tears, but wouldn’t you rather be bored for the short time needed to study hard and grasp the concepts instead of having people rightly think you’re a chucklehead for the rest of your life? Obviously, a whole bunch of people disagree with my take on this. Perhaps ignorance really *is* bliss.  So Henry was outside today, playing in the sprinkler and sporting a Speedo bathing suit (a hand-me-down from his cousins who are avid swimmers). He wasn’t too keen about wearing it, at first. He kept asking for “mine cozy pants” because he’d just skinned his knee that morning. At one point I must have referred to any of his comfier pants (read: sweats) as “cozy pants”, because he’s latched onto that something fierce. He believes cozy pants have the power not only to comfort, but to  heal . So naturally, a skinned knee called for cozy pants. I proceeded to ignore the requests in a chipper manner, because I had a concrete  need  to see that little butt in the Speedo before he outgrew it. And so outside to the sprinkler we went.   Now, I’d love to share pictures with you but then I thought about all the sick motherfuckers out there, and so I’m going to post the pics on my home forum.

So, go check ‘em out, ‘cause they’re a HOOT.  OK, we’re off to a fun party today. I dunno why, but I am strangely calm and yes, even lazy about preparing for my upcoming party.

700788,indUnk,"           Fetish: either I can define it as an object for ritualistic practices, or it could be another sexual instrument that Filipinos love to buy and sell.  Either way, it has the same ritualistic purpose, except sexual fetishes are usually limited to, well, sex rituals.  Anyway, it isn't the type of fetish that anyone probably uses to harbor real cash, because that would be so powerful that it may be more important than any other anting-antings found in Banahaw or whereever.  It usually has a greenish color, signifying nature, moss, or rot which adds to its exotic look.  These green things ARE NOT used for sex practices and may not be used for it in anyway for it would be... detrimental.  Anyway, DO NOT buy sexual fetishes found in urban areas.  A person who requires mystical assistance to get his thing up would probably need to try Obando or somewhere in a rural area.  As for rural fetishes not used for sex rituals, you may find those at these places: Siquijor, Banahaw, Quiapo, Cebu, an other notorius places.  You may also find some in Quezon city but unfortunately, you won't find anything useful because the spirits found inside these materials are already killed by air pollution -- I can't be sure if those sold in Quiapo are any better.  Anyway, for better understanding of these fetishes, you may subscribe to your local Shaman and you may also participate in fora concerning anything that can be utilized magically and can miraculously cure mortality as if it is better than God.      After all these shenanigans, there is no requirement for these.  All I need to say is, whatever fetish is to you is my definition of fetish, for I have no reason to believe in magic anyway.

670684,Student,"       And today, my thoughts are different than they were yesterday.    Here's what I want to do -- I want to write.  I want to give myself the opportunity to make it as a writer.  I'm scared to hell that I'm not good enough, that sometimes I can make a spark when I bang the rocks together, but mostly it's inefficient use of my time, and I should take up finance or some shit.  But I need to give it a go, because I am close.  Two years in this program was invaluable...I know the craft, I can teach the craft, I've met a treasure trove of folks...  But landing a gig, getting a script optioned...not the cakewalk.  A lot of people say that the easy part is getting the agent, and after that the world of Hollywood swallows you whole and you beg that it spits out what's left so you can put that back together and have a semblance of happy life.    So I want to make films.  I'm excited as hell about making films.  But I really need to write films rather than do anything else.  I fuckered a good shot with Austin Meyers on making a film, but it turned from a fun job into a Hollywood venture that depressed me and led me to not answer his last 20 phone calls.  Nothing against Austin, who I really like as a person, but I wasn't excited about making the fourth installment of the film I had written.  He needed to get another writer on board.    And I don't want this blog to become a lamentation of the writer's life...that's just dull.  But there's not a whole lot else going on right now...I am career focused at this, the last semester of my time at UT.  Does it have to be that way?  Maybe.  I'd love for more to go on, but looking at it, my friends here are in the same boat, and my friends everywhere else are fully work-forced, for the most part...and they're not around me on a daily basis.  Which leaves me to look for all sorts of shit to take up my time...I'm getting a ton of writing done, but I'm playing the drums about an hour a day, and I'm buying a new tennis racket tomorrow...get some cardio going without driving to Gregory to wait for a stairmaster (though I miss weights and hot tubs).    So, in 2004, I've gotten two phone numbers.  These weren't numbers I asked for...they were just given to me.  I was out, doing whatever in both situations, when conversation with girls I found attractive started, and meandered, and after a while they had to leave, but this line was the same both times --    Hey, I've got to go, but I've really enjoyed talking to you.  Here's my number.  Call me and we'll continue this conversation.     Okay, I'm not in my best athletic shape today, but regardless, those numbers  were given to me without recourse .  I hadn't asked.  They were under no obligation.  They offered the information.  Sounds money to me.  Except  both times , I've called and gotten no answer, and left a message (nothing too long...I'm wordy but I'm not going to fuck around on an answering machine), and never got the call back.  And I'm honestly flummoxed.  I can't see how pedestrian phone messages would kill someone's want to call me back after  freely giving me a number .    When I first moved to Austin, I never took numbers, I only gave out mine.  If something was going to throw down, I was going to let them make the move...I'm good at calling back.  This worked in Shreveport rather well, but I pulled out a quick 0-3 in Austin, one of which really bothered me because it was a girl that I had an instant connection with and we spent a day together dicking around at Substitute Training, where she actually  held my hand  after lunch, finger lock and everything, and said she didn't think sub training would be any fun.    Gilbert Gottfried, I'm with you --  What The Fuck?   I quietly recovered with a few dates with a chick named Kat who moved to San Diego of all places, and it was fun but more because I was out than because of who I was out with.    So I'm bitching.  Wooooo!  Damn right.  Because I live in a city with 800,000 people, and I can't seem to get out of this dating funk.  This semester, there is no 'the one girl' in my classes, because I've got ONE CLASS, and Debbie is taken.  Students?  I've gone down a similar road before...didn't end well.    In high school, my friends and I used to go to Wal-Mart and play  Get the most phone numbers .  The real race was always between myself and Daniel Harr, the self-proclaimed  ladies man  of this Rogers High School clique.  I can remember one time in particular, when there was so nothing to do in Rogers that night, and this was going to be our sweet redemption for life, and Daniel took an early lead, and all I could spot were people who I had no interest in grabbing numbers from, but if I was going to keep up in the game...  But then Andrea Green wandered to the photo lab to see Courtney Johnson (is that a real person?  I think so), and I pulled up, talked it out, and grabbed both numbers.  At the time, it was the most base reception of numbers...I was friends with both, this wasn't a booty call, just a way to win a game (later I'd find out that Andrea had a thing for me that I never went for, and maybe regretted just a little).  And Daniel had received four numbers, but the voters chose quality over quantity, and I was declared the big winner.  There was no thrusting onto shoulders and parading through electronics and sporting...just the acknowledgement and belittlement of Daniel Harr by the others in the group.  And I couldn't help but feel cheap...his numbers might not've stacked up, but he did the dirty work.  I played pussy foot.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
665500,indUnk,"            Sleep... At Last!   The bug lady didn't come until late in the afternoon, so I sat out here all day for nothing. I wanted to clean my room, but if the bug lady came to the door and I didn't hear her, Mom would've been charged $44 for the missed visit. I sat in front of the PC almost all day.   The bug lady, Annette, said Mom had termite droppings in the window sill in her room. Nice. Just what we need.   I eventually sat on the couch and watched TV for awhile. There was a documentary on Sitting Bull and the Sioux indians on that I wanted to watch (it covered a lot of the things from the book I'd recently finished).   By 6:45pm, before the documentary was over, I was falling asleep on the couch. I just couldn't stay awake. I'd wanted to stay up until 9 or 10pm, but I finally said 'screw it' and went on to bed at 7pm.   I hadn't eaten supper or anything. I was completely exausted.    I didn't fall asleep right away, but I did soon enough. I slept until almost 5am, when I had to get up to pee. I went back to bed, but didn't fall asleep right away. I did eventually though, and I stayed in bed until a little after 10am. I probably could've stayed in bed even longer, but I wanted to get up before it got too late.    I got up and struggled with my computer for a half an hour trying to get online. I was getting pissed. The cable modem says I had a connection, but the computer couldn't access it. Usually I just have to re-start the PC and/or unplug the modem for a minute and it'll work again,. but not today. I must've started and re-started the PC about 10 times and unplugged the modem about 4 or 5 times. The PC froze up on me twice as well. Very frustrating start to my day.   After it started working again (I let it sit for a few minutes before I tried going online), I checked my email and, luckily, had received a payment for some auctions overnight. It was just $13.50, but every little bit helps. I sent out a check to Gateway for $80 yesterday and only I only have about $35 in my checking account right now. I figure I'll be about $10 short, unless I get some more in over the weekend. I can borrow $10 from Mom if I need to, so I'll be OK.  After I got online, I found out that two eBay auctions I was watching, for 2 sealed Jimi Hendrix import CDs, ended overnight for just $0.99 each. I never got to bid on them. That didn't make me happy.   Mom made some chick coffee for us this morning, Chocolate Cake flavored (which pretty much sucked), and I ate chicken, rice, and carrots, what Mom made for dinner last night, for breakfast. Very unusual breakfast for me. While re-heating it all, I managed to spill sauce/juice from the chicken and carrots all over the kitchen floor and I spilled my coffee on the counter.   This day is off to a very rocky start, very up-and-down.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
665500,indUnk,"            Dead Tired   As I guessed, after getting to bed so late last night, I barely slept at all. To be honest, I don't know how I'm still a functioning human being, because I'm just not getting the sleep I need, night after night, week after week. It's got to catch up to me sometime, right?   Today, it felt like it had.  I stayed in bed until after 8am again, but I still made it to work somehow. I didn't have time for breakfast though, so I wound up eating one of those 'Lunchables' at work. Man, I'll tell ya... I was tired before I left for work, but by the time I left work for the day, I felt like I was sleepwalking out the door; I was completely wiped out. It didn't help that I stayed a little later. I probably shouldn't have.   At 3:35pm, after I started packing up, getting ready to go home, JP asked me to stay late and do some research for him and I didn't think to say 'no' or 'I can't', I just said 'ok'. I was too groggy to think straight. I had a package scheduled for delivery from UPS today and I'd wanted to be home early today so I wouldn't miss the delivery, but it completely slipped my mind (luckily they didn't deliver until almost 7pm tonight).   I didn't get out of work until 5:20pm.   Mom picked me up and then dropped me off at Pawn Depot while she ran for chow. I didn't see anything there of interest. She picked me up a gyro and a baklava from my favorite Gyro joint. Man, that thing was good!   After chow, Mom and I watched TV, 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire' and then the NBA Rookie Game (which was ridiculous). They didn't even compete this year, it was all dunks and 3-point shots with no defense whatsoever. It was fun to watch (at times), but it says a lot about the state of the game today (plenty of style, very little substance).   I'm going to stay up and watch (or tape) 'Real Time with Bill Maher', then I'm heading to bed... no alarm tomorrrow, so I hope to catch up on some sleep and get the rest I need.   Oh, and sometime today (I can't even remember when), I won another lot of tapes on eBay, 39 of them for $16.50. Again, that's more than I normally pay for used tapes, but they had some really good titles including several Hendrix. Here's some of the better ones in the lot:  Jimi Hendrix 'The Jimi Hendrix Concerts', Billy Joel 'The Nylon Curtain', The Firm 'The Firm', Bob Marley and the Wailers 'Rastaman Vibration', The Who 'Who's Next', The Doors 'Strange Days', The Jimi Hendrix Experience/Otis Redding 'Live At Monterey', Buddy Holly 'Greatest Hits', Tom Petty 'Hard Promises', Electric Light Orchestra 'Ole Elo', Los Los Lobos 'How Will The Wolf Survive', The Moody Blues 'Long Distance Voyager', Oasis 'Be Here Now', Jimi Hendrix 'Jimi Plays Monterey', John Cougar Mellencamp 'The Lonesome Jubilee', Van Halen 'Women and Children First', John Lennon 'Rock and Roll', and The Temptations 'Greatest Hits'.   There are other decent ones from Robert Plant, The Blues Brothers, Louis Armstrong, and another John Lennon, among others. I got the clear cases I'd ordered in tonight (that was the package I was expecting from UPS), so I'll be playing with my tapes tomorrow, changing cases out. They're not as nice as I'd hoped, most have light scratches or scuffs on them, but they'll work.             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
665500,indUnk,"            Frankenstein   As I mentioned in my previous post, I am feeling pretty shitty. I decided to go to bed early, 2am, as I had begun feeling even worse. I started reading a book to help me get sleepy, but I guess I picked the wrong book because here it is six and a half hours later and I just finished reading  the entire book . I can't believe I read the whole thing! The book I chose, as you might surmise from my heading, was Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein'. It wasn't an easy read because of the language of the period, but it was an enjoyable one nonetheless. Quite different from what I'd expected. Having seen several of the old 'Frankenstein' movies, I'd assumed the book was going to be similar, but it was much, much different. I heard the last Frankenstein movie, the one with DeNiro in it, is supposed to follow the actual book, whereas the others got the Hollywood treatment (totally sensationalized and only vaguely similar to the book). I can't see DeNiro as an eight-foot tall monster, but I can see why they chose him, after all, his character in 'Cape Fear' is very similar to the monster in the Mary Shelley book. I will have to check that one out. I guess I will go and try to sleep again, though with the throbbing in my ears and the inability to breathe through my nose very well, that may not be such an easy thing to do. I don't know which book to start next: 'Les Miserables' or 'Lord Of The Flies', but I have a feeling I'm going to begin one of them shortly.               ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

662223,indUnk,"             Finally my attorney returns my call today after a week and half...probably cause he received a call from the detective. He tells me that she called to tell him that she really likes me and they want to get this over with but that now Robert's been getting emails from someone out of State so they want to know if I've been out of State. He proceeds to tell me that I should probably call her and talk to her. HELLO???!!!! What the hell am I paying you for? I don't want to talk to anyone anymore I'm sick and tired of this shit. I've lost everything that ever meant something to me...my mother is slowly dying...I can't do shit about it. All I want is for this to be over so I can get the hell out of here and far away, even if it means going to the place I've never wanted to be in. I'm hoping it's not that bitch again. What the hell could she possibly want? After all she did, she should know that they're after my ass not hers. Why can't she just take her ivy league education, money, and joy from being successful at screwing up my life and leave me the hell alone? Hopefully distance will take him out of my heart, I know time hasn't. I'm beginning to understand him. If what I feel is what he felt for Sarah or Julia or whoever...I can kind of see why he never opened up to me. Sad thing is I'm kind of dumping the baby with the bath water as they say. I'm leaving my friends and family behind. If I weren't so damn responsible I would have probably left by now. I have nothing to hold me here anymore. My job search is hopeless. I wish I could get my job back at the studio. Being there yesterday was awesome. Seeing everyone again and asking if I was coming back felt good. More than one person informed me that things were not the same without me. They all complain about Carol ....someone actually told me that she must have an IQ of 10....ironic how some people made me feel like anyone with an IQ of 10 could do that job....apparently not! I see that all the things I did, are now being done by four or five different people. Olivia says she wants me back and Vince the Karate teacher doesn't like Carol at all! Unfortunately Rosie doesn't seem to want to get rid of Carol. She knows she's not doing a good job, yet she's not doing much about it. Things are completely disorganized, I'm now helping with things that should have been done a long time ago....it's ridiculous. Not to sound like a conceited bitch, but I AM GOOD at what I do and I know how to run that place backwards and forwards. I did all the bookkeeping and now Rosie is paying someone else to do it. I wonder why people don't really see my qualities and potential...it's funny how the attorney told me that the detective really liked me. When she talked to me the first time she was surprised to know that I was the Secretary to the CEO and CFO of the bank...she  assumed  that I was a teller. Yeah....how could little insignificant me be a Secretary to an executive? In a way this is a good thing...it makes me work harder at showing people what I'm capable of doing. I couldn't believe that after working for 11 hours straight yesterday, I wasn't even tired. After four hours at the bank I was exhausted with my head pounding and my back killing me. My mom arrived to drop off my sister for her picture around 7:00 and she said she expected me to look tired and instead I looked happy! I was...if only for a while. It helps in giving me hope. So back to my original thought. If it's this bitch that is emailing him, then...nah..it would be a miracle if she admitted what she did. That rules out my suspicion of her being in California. She did mentioned an internship in Berkley, but she also mentioned Florida and leaving the country altogether...oh who am I kidding? It's obvious that she wanted me to think that she was in one place when she really wasn't. Then again...mommy and daddy probably have the money to send her wherever the hell she wants. Well I guess I'm going to talk to my attorney and the detective again soon. He wants me to take any receipts I have or bills that I've paid to show that I haven't left the state. Just for kicks I should buy a dildo and take that receipt....lol...even in the worst of times I still manage to find the time to be a smart ass. I only want to make someone smile. :)         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
662223,indUnk,"             I can't believe this is happening. I met a great guy...well I haven't met him. He started talking to me online. His name is Jason so I think that's a sign. He says he does look like Jason Behr except for the ears and he has green eyes. He wears glasses too!!! (I know I'm a geek with a thing for glasses) He's been talking to me everyday and I really want to meet him. He's in San Francisco which is my favorite city. He's a little crazy, but he's an artist. He is like two years younger than me, but age is just a number. He's sweet and sensitive. I'm not completely sure that he's ready to date since he recently broke up with his ex whom he lived with for about two years. He wants to know if I am ready to date too. Of course I am...Robert who?  I'm a little apprehensive about meeting him, because he is a stranger and I can't be sure if everything he tells me is true, but you have to have faith in people. In the meantime, I haven't had and won't have much time to write here, cause I'm busy being happy :) I'm not sure that a long distance relationship would work, but I have been thinking about going back to school and I could try and go there. San Francisco State has a really good Graphic Arts program. Would I leave my friends and family for love?.....I think I would. Only a few people are lucky enough to find love and I don't want to miss that. Jason tells me I should move up there, when I told him that maybe he should move down here he told me exactly what I've been thinking for a while now. People in LA are fake! Which is partly true, the whole Hollywood glamour changes people. I wanna be around people that are down to earth and real, who value important things and whose problems are not 'how to loose weight and get rid of wrinkles fast so that I'll look good for the next party with  so and so who knows so and so who knows the cleaning lady of Julia Roberts'. Working at the dance studio has allowed me to also meet people....from writer's, producers, soap opera actresses, etc. etc., it has shown me that most of them seem to have a stick up their butt. I wanna be with a real passionate artist who sticks for his art and not the money. Who cares if all we can eat is sandwiches everyday. I can make a mean club sandwich :) It's funny how we talk and it's almost as if he could read my mind. Olivia thinks it's a good idea to meet him. She knows all about him. If I talk to Kristi about him she'll automatically think that I'm crazy. Olivia is my confidant and the only one capable of understanding my quirky side. It was about time that the universe would send me a really good friend. Too bad she's always busy. She's the only one that I was able to tell my 'deepest darkest secret' probably because we're both in the same boat and I knew she would be the only one to understand it. Actually there's someone else who knows....maybe I shouldn't have told him....nah I wanted to be open and honest with him. Anyway...that's water under the bridge...I'll let nature take it's course and see what happens with Jason.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
658958,Communications-Media,"                 I haven't been posting much lately.  It seems like I have had a lot of stuff to talk about, but I have just been too lazy to type it.  I have also been trying to get my web site re-structured.  I never really finished this design either.  My site has a lot of problems, so I decided to pretty much start over.  I hope that I can get it finished during my next days off.   Last Wednesday, the  urlLink Wal-Mart  store where I work had it's grand opening as a Wal-Mart Supercenter.  Rather than close the store down and re-build a new building, Wal-Mart decided that they would just expand the current store while keeping most of it open.  The only new thing that the grand opening added to the store was most of the grocery section.  I took my camera to work with me last week to take some pictures.  There are a lot of funny signs and things at work.  I will probably put them up once I get my new photo blog started.  My brother was also able to borrow a  urlLink Lomo LC-A  camera from his teacher, so we went out and took a bunch of pictures with it.  I got those back today, so I will post them soon as well.  I was really excited to try out that camera.  My black and white photos seemed to come out better than my color photos.  Maybe that is because I bought the cheapest color film that I could find at Wal-Mart.  The  urlLink NHL  playoffs have started, and so far I have only been late to work twice.  It wouldn't be such a problem if the games didn't keep going into overtime.  The first round of the playoffs is great because there are usually four games every night.   urlLink ESPN  used to play all four games every night.  They would have two on ESPN and two on ESPN2.  They haven't really done that this year.  They have only been showing two or three.  I don't know why.               ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

640439,Consulting,"           The French Connection  This could be called the last minute trip.  Everything about it came together at the last possible moment.  Deciding to go to Paris really only happened the day before we left.  Not much planning was involved, just a call to Eurolines reservation center to get a seat from Brussells to Paris.  Here is the trip.  We needed to catch a train to Brussels Friday night to catch our 6am bus.  Well we decided to take the last train to minimize our time in train stations.  So we needed to catch the 10:10.  We actually were running down the platform to get on this train.  The conductors were telling us to hurry up.  As we jumped on, the doors closed.  So we are in Brussels, and realizing we have to spend the night here isn't that exciting.  We decide to go into town, walk around a bit, maybe find a bar.  Well we are heading into town and are going down this street.  I've never seen so many prositutes.  Honeslty over a 100 on both sides of the road for several blocks.  Random.  We get close to the center and find a bar.  After a few hours we are tired and need to catch some sleep so we can hit Paris hard the next day.  Walking back to the train station we discover its closed.  We decided to catch some sleep on the benches outside.  We find a good row of benches.  Out of no where a total stranger sits right next to me.  Its 3am, there are plenty of benches, and yet this guy decides to sit next to me.  I was just about to lay down, but now he is too close for me to do so.  I get up and choose a different bench.  One of the guys I was traveling with starts talking to him.  He seems nice enough, talks about Nirvana and his home in Morocco.  I fall asleep.  Within 30 minutes I wake up, shivering.  The temperature has dropped and all I have is a fleece sweatshirt.  I truly felt like a bum, I was lying down with only a backpack and was so cold.  All I could do was lie down and shake.  Around 5am the train station opened up and we went in.  It was cold in there too, but no wind.  Hanging out on a bench, a random guy all of sudden comes from right behind.  He was about to grab my friends backpack, his attempt was not successful.  This trip made me realize that I can't wait not to be a broke college student.  Spending the extra bucks and get a hotel room and the comfort and security it includes.  So we get on the bus, it was a hour late and go to Paris.  The four hour trip was a much needed nap.  We get into Paris and try to find a hostel.  Last minute trip, we didn't reserve.  So the first one we went to was booked (not much of a surprise, mid-May, travel season).  We go to the tourist office and they give us a hostel that has rooms available.  Now we are trying to catch a 3pm afternoon bike tour.  Well we are running late, and are actually running through subway stations.  We emerge from the underground and run to the Eiffle tower trying to find the group.  We missed it by 5 minutes.  Back to subways stations, to this day I still love coming up from underneath.  Its always a new sight, you never know what to expect.   So we hang out by the tower, Im doing one of those typical poses.  Pretending Im leaning against it, supporting my weight.  All of I suddden I hear Dave, Dave.  No way.  It was girl I knew from my marketing class back at A&M.  She had just graduated and was touring around europe for a few weeks.  That has always been one of my hopes, run into someone a world away out of blue.  I guess I can check it off.    So now we just walk around.  The river Siene, Arc de triumph, Champ-Ellyse, the Louve, Notre Dame, and some other parts.  It was an good time.  Random thing, true it was near the Louve, touristy area, but the place was selling Coke for 10.40 a liter.  Now I know I can pick up a 99 cent 2 liter bottle down at the Texaco not more than two blocks from my apartment.  I could make some money in Paris.    The next morning we decide to go to the Louve.  Mona Lisa, great painting.  Is it really better than all the other pieces inside this huge museum?  Whose to say, but I don't really think it is.  Saw the sculpture of aphrodite.  I was like hey lets put our arms inside our shirts and pose next to it. For those that don't know, the statue s missing its arms.  We go ahead and do it.  I was thinking we'd get some stares.  Why are you being disgraceful?  This is art, not humor.  Instead we got our pictures taken and some laughs.  I appreciate art, but now and then its better just to have some fun with.  After the museum we head to the Latin quarter, grab some lunch, and just walk around.  The guys have to get back because they have classes on Monday.  I stay around another day.   For the rest of the afternoon, I check out La Defense, Monte Marte(an amazing view of the city on top of a hill).  On one subway, I notice this Asian couple get on (Im sitting right by the door).  All of a sudden the guy is attacked.  I don't know what happened, but before I could act on it, it was over.  The French guy was off the subway and the Asian was sitting down with torn pants.  Im guessing the French guy went for a money belt or something.  Still I felt bad for the guy. Im sure his trip was a little less enjoyable.    I get back to the hostel around 10ish.  Even brought out the marketing book and read an article I needed to.  I must tell you it rained everyday we were there, forgot to mention.  So now I have strangers in my room.  One guy is in his 40s, and carries around his Jack Kerouc book.  I must admit, I've always wanted to read his poetry.  Anyways, while our conversations was limited this isn't the guy I want to grow to become.  Hes in his 40s traveling alone.  Saying words like cool, man, and the such.  Im sure he loves his life and that is what is important.  Still if I told him the VW minibus was waiting down on the street, full of petro, with no destination known he would have said Lets do it Man, it'll be one hell of a journey.  I'd rather not be single, traveling alone and staying in youth hostels when Im at his age.    The next morning I was going to go on a tour, but with the rain I decide to go ahead and axe the idea.  I walk around, see Sorbonne, Luxembourg gardens, and just walk..a ton.  The rain is picking up and Im getting too wet.  I decide to go ahead and check out a book or record store.  Well I find this cool little record shop.  I hang out in there for about a hour.  Listening to all sorts of music.  While they had the big American artists, they had a ton of independant ones as well.  Had an entire section.  Even found a single copy of my boy Mraz.  Made my day.  Checked out a bookstore, then needed to catch my bus.    So I want to go to the bathroom.  Number 2 in fact.   Im at the bus station, and to open the doors you have to pay 20 cents.  So I put in my money, open the door, and look in with nothing but shock.  It was disgusting and didn't even had a seat.  About to squat I decide to check to see if there was tp.  Nope.  I get out and leave.   Boarding the bus, the driver said we weren't allowed to use the bathroom.  I just closed my eyes and fell asleep.  The bus was a hour late.  I missed my train.  Made the last available train.  This train was running slow, I would have missed my connecting train to Maastricht, but since it was the last one they held it back.  Thank God.  I couldn't imagine spending another night in a train station.  Thinking Im going to have to walk the 40 minutes or so back to the Guesthouse I'm not too excited.  However all the city buses are lined up.  I hop in one I need, and in about 2 minutes all of them take off.  It was the last round.    All in all France was a great time.  It ranks near the top of favorite places of been to.  Rome is still on the top.  London might be higher up, but I need to back one day and explore it a bit more.  The French were also a lot nicer than I was expecting.  Their English isn't that good, but they know some, where as I would not be able to help a French tourist in America.  Also there is something right with the French gene pool.  The French girls put the Dutch to shame.  Plus they have style.  Dont get me wrong, the Dutch have a certain style to, its just one Im not too fond of.    2 more week to go in Maastricht.  I've realized well that isn't all that much time.  Im starting to study and before I know it, it'll be over.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

623323,indUnk,"       Well hello there! Long time no Blog, so I thought I'd better come and fill this bugger in.  As you can see from earlier posts, I failed my case study exam. This is annoying because (1) I've gotta resit it, and I hoped I'd never see the cream-painted walls of ATC again (as pretty as they are!) (2) The resit course clashes nicely with my planned trip to the States, for Em's brother's wedding. This is particularly annoying cos I was really looking forward to it, and it was just another disappointment in a really disappointing weekend.  However, things are looking up now, cos I think I'll be able to get back early on Monday morning, and the course starts on Tuesday. Woohoo! If anyone has any bright ideas on combatting jetlag, or indeed on good places to get car hire or particularly nice airlines, email me at the  urlLink usual  address!  Other news. I'm working in Slough at the moment - yes, right on the Slough Trading Estate - and a lunchtime last week was spent looking for the Office building. Found it too - my colleague wants a photo right outside it, so expect them to be appearing on line some time when I remember to upload them! I still have a reel of film to upload from Christmas, which I will do when I get around to it. About two weeks ok?  In technology news, I now run a dual boot system with Win2000 and Mandrake Linux 9 - this is indeed being typed on Mozilla 1.1 under Linux. It's ok, however it's not doing what I wanted it to do, because: a) xmltv refuses to compile - or specifically a perl module it requires refuses to compile b) freevo keeps crashing, but I can work on that c) my G450 card does not output onto the TV head under linux without some nasty-looking poking of the kernel. Now, I believe that it *can* be done, I just don't understand how to do it. Any offers?  But if I can get all these things to work, then I'll have myself a nice little PVR - which will eventually run via infra red from downstairs. PS if you ever come to my house, just have a look behind the TV and have a laugh at the cable running upstairs to the bedroom - it's amazing what you can do with a pair of scissors, some gaffa tape and a 10m run of telephone extension lead......  But I don't think there's much else going on. At least, I can't think of anything! Have been spending a ludicrous amount of money on CDs recently - just bought:  blur - the best of eels - beautiful freak oasis - the masterplan lemon jelly - lost horizons david gray - new day at midnight  and for xmas I got:  u2 - best of 1990-2000 (despite it including songs from 2002....) coldplay - a rush of blood to the head  I'm working on putting my entire CD catalog online at some point, I have all the albums entered now, just the compilations to go, then my own compiled CDs - and I'm not 100% happy with the software I've got at the moment. (Songs-DB if you're interested!) Dave has given me some ideas - will have to look at them at some point.  Wow, what an incredibly long blog entry! Time to go and pack my bags now for another trip to sunny Slough....         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
619960,Communications-Media,"           Abbey of Gethsemani...Aaah...3 days of silence.  OK it was more like 2 1/4 days because on Monday God knocked all my nice 'duckies in formation' all over creation.  I reacted poorly.  Became an ass.  Became?  OK, maybe I just went to new levels of assdome.  Anyway, fumed (pouted?) the whole way to Trappist, KY because things didn't go my way.  Great start for a spiritual retreat. Oh well.   Got there in time to eat, go to Compline & hear Father Matthew's talks. (Yes, Alan, He ROCKS!)  He spoke of living in God's favor and easing into the rhythm of life rather than trying so hard to make things fit.  (Ducks in a row?)  It reminded me of the 1st time going skiing.  At first I hated that stupid ski lift.  But I learned once I relaxed & went with it, rather than trying so hard I was able to jump right on & go with it.  Set the pace for the next couple of days.   The rest of the trip seemed to be all about 'the journey'.  I started reading Eugene Peterson's   A Long Obedience in the Same Direction .  It's meditations on the Songs of Ascents (Psalms 120-134 the songs sung by Hebrew Pilgrims on their way up to worship in Jerusalem).  Really great stuff that flies in the face of our instant society.   Had this beautiful experience walking up one of the wooded trails to the Hill of Statues.  I walked it very slowly trying to take it all in.  Beauty of the setting.  Statues and signs all along the way.  It's actually like walking through worship installations.  I stopped at each point, took pictures, spent time meditating, writing down my thoughts & prayers.    Through the whole experience God spoke very clearly about living in his grace.  In a very simple way God reminded me over & over about how far reaching His grace is.  The Abbey bell tolls every 15 minutes.  All along the way (I took about 3 hours on this 'journey') I could hear the bells.  No matter how far I got I was always within the sound of the bell.  Even at one point when I got off the path, stuck in these thorny plants taller than me I heard the bell. Great image of my life story!   I loved attending the prayer offices.  Yes, I even did the Vigils at 3 am both days. Of course unlike the monks I went back to bed!  God neatly wrapped the whole journey thing together on Wed during the prayer offices.  We chanted Psalms 120-134.   One last thing, ran across a cool little book in the library.   A Celtic Benediction  by J. Philip Newell.  Heard of it, Debi?  I think you'd like it.  It's a book of morning & night prayers based on the 7 days of Creation.  Here's one of the prayers:       For the first showings of the morning light and the emerging outline of the day thanks be to you, O God. For earth's colors drawn forth by the sun its brilliance piercing clouds of darkness and shimmering through leaves and flowing waters thanks be to you. Show to me this day amidst life's dark streaks of wrong and suffering the light that endures every person. Dispel the confusions that cling close to my soul that I may see with eyes washed by your grace that I may see myself and all people with eyes cleansed by the freshness of the new day's light.

619960,Communications-Media,"           A  urlLink friend  who I work with and I have been frustrated over the price of what some ministries are charging for just basic worship and media images.  We thought it would be cool just to give Lakeview's weekend and teaching stuff away so we put together all of the original and royalty free stuff that we have used (we also use comp images that we can't distribute) and post them online for free.  You can find them  urlLink here .  There is generic title slides (Lakeview logos have been taken out) and some background slides (for teaching and worship).  All are set up around a metaphor.  We know how strapped churches can be financially and I have been priviledged to work with a really talented artist so spread the word and steal the images if they are worth while.  Everything is free and we hope to add another 30-40 weeks of images a year.  If you know of any churches that are struggling in the area of media images, let them know of the site.

619488,indUnk,"       so yesterday i went to lunch with some friends at Fresno's and they embarrassed me by having the waitstaff sing happy birthday to me (thanks carrie).  by embarrass of course i mean delighted, because really everybody complains when people sing to you but secretly enjoys it.  i even got a gift!  :)  they gave me cobalt blue dinnerware that will perfectly match the canisters that i have already :)  i'm very excited to have my own kitchen and be able to use it...  speaking of kitchens, i've decided to paint the table that i bought red.  'cranberry zing' to be exact.  i may decoupage the top of the table, but i haven't really decided on that yet.  but the table will definately be red.  i think a red table will look cool with cobalt blue dinnerware on top.  if i did decoupage the table, i'd use vintage advertisements...  well, copies of vintage ads...  especially liquor ads, because they're hella cool.  i bought a print of one that will go in my kitchen:     I've found a bunch of ads like that online, so i may print them out and use them for my table...  or, i could make placemats out of them, that way i could have them on the table when i wanted them, and if i got sick of them i could remove them...   that's  probably a good idea....    my mom sent me shoes in the mail today.  when we were in AZ i saw a pair of steve madden shoes that i'd been lusting after for a while at that last chance store, but they weren't in my size, but i guess my mom found them in my size on a later trip :)  they kinda look like a cross between running and bowling shoes but they're red and they're clogs.  they're lovely.    I looked at another apartment today.  in the paper it was advertised as $545 but after i saw it and decided it was perfect they informed me that it was $580, which was hella annoying.  and it didn't include any utilities, and it was electric heat, so that would be too much.  ah well.  the search continues....     well...  i'm bored.  but it's too late to go out and start cleaning the table and getting it ready to be painted....  ah well...  my birthday is the day after tomorrow.  YAY!  but...  i'll probably be depressed (and not cause i'm getting older)...  i was watching the history channel earlier and it just made me miss tim...  i used to love to be lazy with him and do nothing but lay in bed and watch tv (especially the history channel or TLC or the discovery channel...)  but i guess that was old tim and evil/darth tim has killed him.  damn darth tim.

I was really tired cause i'd been up all night at work the night before, and so i kept yawning...  then the dr kept drilling my gums  ouch  i was like, 'see that pink part?  yeah, that's my gum, don't drill it'...  the appointment took forever, and then, to top it all off, they had B95.5 on the radio which plays soft rock (which irritates me to begin with) and there was some stupid radio show, 'Delilah', on and they played all sorts of love or post-love songs that really depressed the hell out of me.  They played that song from Pearl Harbor and if you don't think that it's about someone who's died, you can apply it to a dead relationship, and it's hella depressing...  and it made me think of the movie which made me think of going to see it with tim...  ugh, very depressing...  so i'm sitting there with my mouth crammed full of tubes and sucky-things and drills and fingers etc and i started tearing up.  sucked.  i miss tim.

OH MY GOSH, they are so cute!  i saw a lot of my King's Club kids there too. most of them are 2nd graders or older, but i had some kindergardeners today. it was good to see them, and they actually recognized me. i made some new friends too, but i'm biast to my kids first. OH I MISS THEM!   seeing them a few times a week, through the program and home visits will leave the deepest of memories with me. it really makes me thing what kind of work/ministry should i persue? i know that where i am now is exactly where God wants me, but how do i figure out where He wants me to be in the future, or how to get there? i feel really slow when it comes to hearing and listening to His voice.   i am so grateful that in the midst of looking for a job and finding direction, God provides me with simple loves and joys. may i continue to live and be a blessing to everyone i encounter. all things in His great timing.

579034,Student,"       WOW this week was soooo long. Thank God it's Friday. Tonight I'm gonna go over Stasi's w/ Deb, Jenn, I think Fea, Simione and Rubin. Should be fun. John's not commin though cause he don't like Stasi lol. So.. oh yea.. I just had like a 30 minute converstaion with a telemarketer. It was kinda funny actaully. He said he wanted to talk to me about switching Verison for long distance phone calls and I said 'I'm not the bill payer of the house.' and he goes 'Oh, are you the daughter?' and I said 'That would be me.' and he said 'Oh, how old are you?' and I said '16.' and then hes like 'Oh, well I'm 18 so don't think your talking to an old man.' I'm like 'Okay.' so then he asked me if I had a boyfriend I could call long distance to and I'm like nah. And we started to talk about who casues more trouble: boys or girls. Then he asked me my nationality and asked how Staten Island was (I guess next to my number it says that or something) and I'm like 'Cold. It's really cold outside.' and hes like 'Oh really? Im in Alberquirkie (sp?), New Mexico.' and so I asked 'Hows the weather there?' and hes like 'It's nice, it rained this morning though.' and I'm like 'Well as long as it's sunny now!' and then he told me that hes from Long Island origonally. And then I don't know he asked me if I had an e-mial address and I said yes, but he didn't ask for it. And then he said 'Okay, I'm sure you dont want to say on the phone with me.' and I go, 'Nah, I don't have anything else to do' so we talked for a little while longer and then that was it and he said he would call back later and the phone just rang five minutes ago but I didn't get to it in time. Oh well lol... okay, I'll post when I get back from Vins! Peace x0x0x0x0x0x0x0x         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
578626,Education,"       What a difference a couple days make.  &nbsp;  Yes, I still feel guilty about letting him cry on Friday. But he knows how to fall asleep now, and he keeps getting better at it. Yesterday, I told Sara The Wonder Nanny that she was to put him in his crib awake. This elicited a deer-in-the-headlights look of fear. But I told her to give it a try.  &nbsp;  Not only did he go down, he did so quickly and with no crying or fussing. Then he did it again for his afternoon nap. This is amazing.  &nbsp;  Now Eric is not a fussy guy in general. That's part of why it was such a heart-wrenching decision to let him cry. He only cries when he's trying to tell me something is wrong, and I was terrified I'd break that covenant with him. He cries, I try to fix whatever is bothering him. But we were getting nowhere with his sleeping.  &nbsp;  Last night he went down with nary a peep. I sat in the glider in the corner. He thrashes around until he achieves the perfect frog position, his legs tucked neatly underneath him with his tushy sticking up in the air. Then he picks up his head to check and see if I'm there, and he falls asleep. A day ago, I had to stand over his crib stroking his hair and help him stay focused. Now I just do that if he forgets to lie down. I sit and make the occasional shusshing noise and presto! He falls asleep. But now he stays asleep until close to 2:00 AM, and that folks is the medical definition of a baby sleeping through the night.  &nbsp;  Then last night he came in bed with me an nursed and he proceeded to thrash around. It's so cute. One of the positions he tries is leaning back on Rich resting his head sideways, arms akimbo. He looks like a dude in a movie theater trying to look casual as he attempts to cop a feel. It's especially cute if he leans back on his dad and yawns.  &nbsp;  But last night I thought,&nbsp;'If he's going to thrash, he may as well thrash in the crib, because there's no way I'm falling asleep&nbsp;before he does at this rate.'&nbsp;So, I recribified him, stood over him for a few minutes and then worked my way to the glider and dozed while he got himself back to sleep. Then I went back to bed. At five he woke up.&nbsp;(He usually nurses around 5, but I'd rather he did it after 6:30 when it's officially OK to get us up.) So, I sat there&nbsp;dozing in my chair and it was about half an hour from start to finish and he was down again with no crying, just some thrashing. It was pretty amazing. A week ago, he was waking me up every 2 hours to nurse, and now he seems OK sleeping in his crib.  &nbsp;  Tonight, I think I'll nurse him in his room at 2, and put him back down in the crib. I could probably make him sleep completely through the night with no nursing, but I don't want to push for that until he's one. But that will be in about six weeks, so it's good that we're working toward that.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
577518,Student,"            HAPPY FATHER'S DAY to all cool daddy out there  :) Drive my mom to market this morning, a bit nervous actually, hehe. My mom sat next to me and looks really calm, that's cool. Then my mom's father, who is my grandpa phoned to told us he will visit to our house later. That's a big surprise actually.   Grandpa just came back from his vacation to China, then he just drop by our house to chat with mom and ask my aunts to come here too. I can't tell you how  kecoh   they were.   And my annoying cousin was here. My mom cook a bowl of delicious mee for her because she was hungry, er, so jealous, hey, that's my mom. Then my mom washed the dishes for her, such a lazy fella (annoying)! Then she came in to my room while I was busy doing my homeworks. Then she sat on my bed, her mom came in, looked at my room and began to criticise about my small little room. 'My daughter's room is much bigger than yours, you know?', then my annoying cousin said, 'yaloh, my room is much bigger than this.' Then her mom said, 'You have everything bigger and better than her', oh, she said that in front of me. Then annoying bitch said, 'ya, agree. But my body is much smaller than her, so there's the only thing I have which smaller than her'. Then both of them laugh and laugh non stop, they thought that's a good joke. Ok, now you shut up, you idiot. I stayed as cool as possible and I was ignoring them. That's still not over yet, her mom went in to the kitchen and told my mom about this not-funny-joke.   Then she sat on my bed again, looking at me, I ignored her till the end. Realising that I didn't talk to her, so she started to stand up and I thought she will left. But no, she began to touch my things. She touched my doll, my comics, my books and other things. Then she took one of my Crayon Sinchan comic out of my room, arg.   Now, I want to tell you, I LOVE MY ROOM VERY MUCH AND I DON'T CARE HOW FAT I AM, THAT'S ME!  When I first moved to my new house, I choose this small room because I love it. I feel unsafe in a big room and a small room makes me feel very warm. I have my own space in this small room. I hide in a small space between my bed and the wall when I was sad and I feel really really safe. That's my room, my privacy.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

554681,indUnk,"       Most Americans Think They Have a Book in Them  Monday September 23, 5:20 am ET    TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Sept. 23 /PRNewswire/ -- Eighty-one percent of Americans feel they should write a book, according to a survey of 1,006 adult Americans commissioned by Jenkins Group, Inc., a Michigan publishing services firm, which sponsors the annual Independent Publisher Book Awards and issues the monthly online magazine Independent Publisher. 'Of course, most people will never get around to committing their thoughts to paper -- let alone get them published -- but it's astonishing how many people feel they have a story to tell,' said Jenkins Group Chairman and CEO Jerrold Jenkins.  Jenkins estimates that 6 million Americans have actually written a manuscript -- just over 2% of the population -- while, based on ISBN numbers assigned, approximately 80,000 books get published each year. Jenkins added that the number of books annually making it into print is growing, thanks to a boom in independent and self-publishing.  Jenkins noted that while some respondents feel they could write more than one type of book, only about a quarter of Americans (27%) say they would write a work of fiction. 'The bulk of prospective authors see themselves writing some form of non-fiction, be it a biography, self-help, do-it-yourself or cookbook.'       Which of the Following Types of Books Do You Think You Have In You? (Some respondents chose more than one option)     * Self-help/do-it-yourself -- 28%     * General non-fiction (history, biography, etc.) -- 27%     * Fiction -- 27%     * Some other type (cookbook, picture book, etc.) -- 20%   The proliferation of personal web sites and Blogs as well as the ease of writing and editing with word processing have caused more people to regard themselves as potential authors, believes Jenkins. 'We're in an information-oriented society and technology today allows people to share their ideas easily and quickly with a wider audience than anyone could have imagined a decade ago.  'Still it's a big leap, going from personal musings on the Web or stories composed on a computer, to writing a book that merits publication,' cautioned Jenkins. 'Even among the growing number of self-publishers today, we see a level of quality and professionalism that sets them apart from the average American. Talent, originality, effort and determination tend to separate those who contemplate writing a book from those who actually do it.'  The EXCEL Telephone Omnibus Survey of 1,006 adult Americans has a margin of error of +/-3.1%. It was conducted for Jenkins Group, Inc. by International Communications Research, Media, PA.  Jenkins Group, Inc. was founded in 1988 as a provider of services to independent, university and small press book publishers. Based in Traverse City, Mich., the company serves individual and corporate clients internationally with a full range of custom book publishing and packaging services, consulting services and marketing services to the specialty, non-traditional book market.

554681,indUnk,"        Fall books preview  The hot new titles to look for in the coming months, from fiction to biography to politics.  - - - - - - - - - - - - By Laura Miller  Sept. 11, 2003  |  Over the next three months, the publishing industry floods bookstores with the best -- and sometimes just the flashiest -- books of the year. It can be hard to keep up even when it's your job, so for the average overwhelmed reader out there, we offer this highly selective list of titles to watch out for.   Politics   With the 2004 campaign season heating up, expect the usual rash of snoozy trail tracts by the likes of John Kerry ('A Call to Service,' from Viking in October) and John Edwards ('My Trials,' from Simon & Schuster in January), plus 'Winning Modern Wars: Iraq, Terrorism and the American Empire' by Wesley Clark, coming from Princeton next month. Walter Shapiro kills, er, covers several birds with one stone in 'One-Car Caravan: On the Road With the 2004 Democratic Hopefuls' (Public Affairs, November). Bush haters will lap up 'Bushwhacked' by Molly Ivins and Lou Dubose (Random House), also set to arrive in September, Michael Moore's 'Dude, Where's My Country?' (Warner, October) and 'The Lies of George W. Bush' by David Corn (Crown, September). TV commentator Alan Colmes offers the undoubtedly more tepid 'Red, White and Liberal: Why the Left is Right and the Right is Wrong' (ReganBooks, October).   On the other side, Bill O'Reilly (yes, again) asks 'Who's Looking Out For You?' (Broadway Books, September) and Bernard Goldberg deplores 'Arrogance: Rescuing America From the Media Elite' (Warner, November). What Greta Van Susteren will have to say in 'My Turn at the Bully Pulpit' (Crown, September) is anyone's guess. Meanwhile, Pulitzer-winning playwright Tony Kushner will seek to rally the nation's youth with 'Save Your Democratic Citizen Soul!' (New Press, November). And for those craving dish from deep inside the Beltway, there's 'The Georgetown Ladies Social Club' by C. David Heymann (Atria, October) about the klatch of five women who ran D.C. over the past half-century.   History   It's shaping up to be a terrific season for narrative histories in the spirit of Laura Hillenbrand's 'Seabiscuit.' We're particularly looking forward to: 'The Bounty,' an account of the notorious mutiny by 'Endurance' author Caroline Alexander (Viking, September); 'Fallingwater Rising,' a 'biography' of Frank Lloyd Wright's famous house by Franklin Toker (Knopf, September); 'A Venetian Affair,' based on some long-lost 18th century love letters written by the ancestor of author Andrea di Robilant (Knopf, September); David Foster Wallace's history of the concept of infinity, 'Everything and More' (W.W. Norton, October); 'The Perfect Prince,' the true story of a Renaissance-era imposter by Ann Wroe (Random, October); David Maraniss' innovative dual-track look at the Vietnam War at home and in Southeast Asia, 'They Marched Into Sunlight' (Simon & Schuster, October); and two new histories by bestselling authors Nathaniel Philbrick ('Sea of Glory,' about a 1838 exploring expedition, Viking, November) and Mark Kurlansky ('1968: The Year That Rocked the World,' Ballantine, December).   Traditional history looks good, too. Paul Fussell takes issue with romanticized portraits of World War II in 'The Boy's Crusade' (Modern Library, September). 'Refuge in Hell: How Berlin's Jewish Hospital Outlasted the Nazis' by Daniel Silver illuminates how that institution miraculously survived (Houghton Mifflin, September). Edwin Black exposes the American roots of the Nazis' nightmarish racial attitudes in 'War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race' (Four Walls Eight Windows, September). Military history buffs will snap up Victor Davis Hanson's latest, 'Ripples of Battle: How Wars Fought Long Ago Determine How We Fight, How We Live, How We Think' (Doubleday, September).   Early word on 'Love and Hate in Jamestown' by David A. Price (Knopf, October) says this view of Colonial America is a page-turner. You can go even further back into the past with the purportedly definitive 'One Vast Winter Count: The Native-American West Before Lewis and Clark' by Colin G. Calloway (Univ. of Nebraska Press, October) or to recent times with Joseph E. Stiglitz's 'The Roaring Nineties: A New History of the World's Most Prosperous Decade' (W.W. Norton, October). One of the few Founding Fathers who hasn't been exhaustively reexamined recently is our first president; now Henry Wiencek weighs in with 'An Imperfect God: George Washington, His Slaves and the Creation of America' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, November). Garry Wills, meanwhile, offers a controversial look at the role of slave states in the election of Thomas Jefferson in 'Negro President' (Houghton Mifflin, November).   An infamous episode in American history is revisited by Steve Oney in 'And the Dead Shall Rise: The Murder of Mary Phagan and the Lynching of Leo Frank' (Pantheon, October). Michael McGerr traces the evolution of a political movement in 'A Fierce Discontent: The Rise and Fall of the Progressive Movement in America, 1870-1920' (Free Press, September). After the release from prison of Kathy Boudin, Knopf is pushing up the publication date of Susan Braudy's 'Family Circle: The Boudins and the Aristocracy of the Left' to later this month.   If your historical interests are more international, Thomas Cahill continues his bestselling series with 'Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter' (Doubleday, October). A rare cache of photographs taken during China's Cultural Revolution will be published as 'Red-Color News Soldier' by Li Zhensheng (Phaidon, September). Peter Balakian indicts U.S. inaction in 'The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response' (HarperCollins, October).   Fiction   Only time will tell if the season's bumper crop of first novels will yield any choice specimens, but readers can also take their pick from books by more familiar talents. In September, the 50th anniversary of 'The Adventures of Augie March' makes a fine occasion to revisit Saul Bellow's masterwork, and Viking is putting out a special edition of it. The fall's hottest new literary novel is Jonathan Lethem's 'Fortress of Solitude' (Doubleday), like 'Motherless Brooklyn' a paean to his hometown. Pulitzer-winner Jhumpa Lahiri comes out with her first novel, 'The Namesake' (Houghton Mifflin), and Neal Stephenson follows up his bestselling 'Cryptonomicon' with 'Quicksilver' (William Morrow), the first of a three-book series set among the scientific geniuses of the 1600s, sure to set geekish hearts aflutter. 'Paris Trout' author Pete Dexter will tell further tales of working-class heroes in 'Train' (Doubleday), and fans of the Melvillian herstory of 'Ahab's Wife' should look out for Sena Jeter Naslund's new Civil Rights-era novel, 'Four Spirits' (Morrow). 'Outlanders' creator Diana Gabaldon starts a new trilogy with 'Lord John and the Private Matter' (Bantam).   In October, Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison's 'Love' (Knopf), reputed to be her best book in years, hits the stores. Look for new novels from Steve Martin ('The Pleasure of My Company,' Hyperion), David Guterson ('Our Lady of the Forest,' Knopf), and 'Gap Creek' author Robert Morgan ('Brave Enemies,' Algonquin). Edmund White has based his latest work of fiction, 'Fanny' (Ecco) on the life of Anthony Trollope's mother, an ardent abolitionist. Booker-winner J.M. Coetzee will publish a novel with an animal rights theme, 'Elizabeth Costello' (Viking). Writers' writer Shirley Hazzard has a new novel, too, 'The Great Fire' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), set in Asia and Europe in the aftermath of World War II. Peter Straub returns to his trademark spooky stuff in 'Lost Boy, Lost Girl' (Random), and literary writer Stewart O'Nan also tries his hand at a ghost story with 'The Night Country' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). Two giants of the mystery genre will bring out new books: Patricia Cornwell ('Blow Fly,' Putnam) and Sara Paretsky ('Blacklist,' Putnam). Cornelia Funke's children's novel 'The Thief Lord,' was a surprise crossover hit a year or two ago; her latest, 'Inkheart,' will be brought to us by the Potter-pushers at Scholastic. And last but not least, the University of California Press will publish a posthumously recovered play by Mark Twain, 'Is He Dead?'   Popular favorites add to their ongoing series in November, notably Anne Rice giving her fans more Lestat in 'Blood Canticle' (Knopf), and Elizabeth Peters offering a guide to 'Amelia Peabody's Egypt: A Compendium' (Morrow). Stephen King begins the beginning of the end of his Dark Tower series with 'Wolves of the Calla' (Scribner). Terry McMillan will further chronicle the lives of her African-American women characters in 'The Interruption of Everything' (Viking). On the literary side, there are new novels from Booker-winners Pat Barker ('Double Vision,' Farrar, Strauss & Giroux) and Peter Carey ('My Life as a Fake,' Knopf). Jim Crace, author of 'Being Dead,' tells the story of a man who keeps fathering children in 'Genesis' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux), and Tobias Wolff's 'Old School' (Knopf) describes a schoolboy's experience meeting his literary idol. Those whose readerly appetites are whetted by literary feuds will want to see if Martin Amis' 'Yellow Dog,' (Miramax), his first novel in seven years, lives up (or down) to the drubbing it received from fellow writer Tibor Fischer in the Daily Telegraph.   Business and Money   On pocketbook issues, Pulitzer-winning New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston exposes the way the tax system benefits the rich in 'Perfectly Legal' (Portfolio, Dec.). Elizabeth Warren and Amelia Warren Tyagi look at 'The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Their Families Are Going Broke' (Basic, September). Doug Henwood presents a left-of-center take on the recent bubble and its bursting in 'After the New Economy' (New Press, October).   In the realm of corporate misadventures, the reporters who helped expose Enron tell its story in 'The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Rise and Fall of Enron' by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind (Viking, October). Kara Swisher offers her take on some bad business decisions in 'There Must Be a Pony in Here Somewhere: The AOL Time Warner Debacle' (Crown, October). A controversial tycoon gets the once-over from Karen Southwick in 'Everyone Else Must Fail: The Unvarnished Truth About Oracle and Larry Ellison' (Crown, November)   The Way We Live Now   Not surprisingly, this fall is packed with new books about the ongoing encroachments on Americans' civil liberties. To list a few, all appearing this month: 'Lost Liberties: Ashcroft and the Assault on Personal Freedom' by Cynthia Brown (New Press); 'Enemy Aliens: Double Standards and Constitutional Freedom in the War on Terrorism' by David Cole (New Press); 'Terrorism and Tyranny: Trampling Freedom, Justice and Peace to Rid the World of Evil' by James Bovard (Palgrave); 'The War on the Bill of Rights and the Gathering Resistance' by Nat Hentoff (Seven Stories); 'Why Societies Need Dissent by law professor Cass Sunstein (Harvard).   The state of the war on terrorism also gets several long, hard looks. Gerald Posner explains the lapses that permitted the attacks of September 11 'Why America Slept' (Random, September). Ronald Kessler examines 'The CIA at War: Inside the Secret Campaign on Terror' (St. Martin's, October). Benjamin Barber, author of the prescient 'Jihad vs. McWorld,' looks at U.S. policy mistakes that breed terrorism in 'Fear's Empire' (W.W. Norton, September). Michael Ignatieff parses some painful moral dilemmas in 'Lesser Evil: Political Ethics in an Age of Terror' (Princeton, Dec.), and two neocon players lay out their agenda in 'An End to Evil: What's Next in the War on Terror' by David Frum and Richard Perle (Random, Dec.).   Curtis White expands a Harper's essay attacking NPR's Terry Gross into 'The Middle Mind: Why American's Don't Think For Themselves' (HarperSanFrancisco, September). Linda Perlstein spent many hours among her subjects to write 'Not Much Just Chillin: The Hidden Lives of Middle Schoolers' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, September).

Joanna Lipper takes a close-up look at the lives of six teenage mothers in 'Growing Up Fast' (Picador, November). Stephen Prothero describes the 'Elvisification' of Christ in 'American Jesus: How the Son of God Became a National Icon' (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Dec.).   Finally, Studs Terkel proffers sustaining thoughts in 'Hope Dies Last: Keeping the Faith in Difficult Times' (New Press, November) and Gregg Easterbrook explains that it's precisely when people think things are at their worst that they are actually improving in 'The Progress Paradox' (Random House, November).   Biography   Nigel Hamiliton's unauthorized biography of Bill Clinton arrives late this month from Random House, around the same time that Clinton's secretary of state (the first woman to hold that position), Madeleine Albright, will publish her own memoir, 'Madam Secretary' (Miramax).

If you're dead, someone else gets to set the record straight, as Geoffrey Wolff is currently doing for the late novelist John O'Hara ('The Art of Burning Bridges,' Knopf). Nathaniel Hawthrone gets a major bio from Brenda Wineapple ('Hawthorne,' Knopf, September), Mariane Pearl (with help from Sarah Crichton) writes of her murdered husband in 'A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearl' (Scribner, September). Another legendary journalist, Martha Gellhorn, is the subject of Caroline Moorehead's 'Gellhorn: A 20th Century Life' (Holt, October). A biographer who's a bit of a legend herself, Diane Middlebrook, tackles the marriage of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes in 'Her Husband' (Viking, October), and the author of '1984' gets another biography in Gordon Bowker's 'Inside George Orwell' (Palgrave, September). A very famous family gets a major multigeneration history in 'The Kennedys: America's Emerald Kings' by Thomas Maier (Basic, October). And no art lover will want to miss a great critic's book on a great painter, Robert Hughes' 'Goya' (Knopf, November)   Away From Home   Two writers put forward their arguments on the conflicts in the Middle East in 'The Case for Israel' by Alan Dershowitz (Wiley, September) and 'Right To Exist: A Moral Defense of Israel's Wars' by Yaacov Lozowick, a former peace activist turned reluctant Sharon supporter (Doubleday, September). Barbara Victor investigates a relatively new phenomenon in 'Army of Roses: Inside the World of Palestinian Women Suicide Bombers' (Rodale, October).   Central Asia is a region that's fascinating many writers these days: Tom Bissell's 'Chasing the Sea: Lost Among the Ghosts of Empire in Central Asia' (Pantheon, September) and 'The Storyteller's Daughter' by 'Beyond the Veil' director Saira Shah (Knopf, September) are two notable examples. Lutz Kleveman writes of the area's geopolitical significance in 'The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia' (Atlantic Monthly Press, September).   Dispatches from other trouble spots include a new book from bestselling author Tracy Kidder about a selfless doctor working under dire conditions in Haiti, 'Mountains Beyond Mountains' (Random House, September). Janine Di Giovanni describes her experiences as a journalist in the Balkans in 'Madness Visible: A Memoir of War' (Knopf, November).

546850,indUnk,"       'Joe Millionaire'  On the last episode the only one I actually watched the lady said something that caught my attention.  She said, 'I don't even know what to do with all of that money,' after the butler gave them a million dollars.  It made me think of my current financial situation.  I am not rich by any means, but with this current budget, I find myself starting to become like the third servant that buried his money in the famous parable told by Christ.  I don't even know what to do with what I have now, so I find that I'm just letting it sit there in the bank.  It's not much by any means, but I can buy at least one of the items of my wishlist that I always make.  However, I refrain from going on a shopping spree, because I refuse to be a typical, materialistic American.  I'm hoping to somehow invest it in something that will give me more than I put in, so that I can start paying off my school loans.  It's not enough, however, to spend on shares in the stockmarket.  So, I'm right now praying that God will give me the wisdom to do the best thing I can with what I'm given... at least in this way, whatever good comes out of it will be truly attributable to wisdom given by Him.

518116,indUnk,"       Wow...where to begin...so, my so called friend, the on again, off again...emailed me 'just in case I didn't know yet' that mr x got married.  The thing that makes me laugh the most is that she truly expects me to have an emotional breakdown in front of her...this is the same girl, upon arriving home from the hospital after having b, had left a message for hubby 'in case I hadn't let him know yet' and that I was in the hospital in labor.  Did she truly think I would tell her before I told him?!  Anyway, she would be the last person I would share my emotions with...unless it was a well thought out manipulation to spread the word around kzoo and surrounding areas...  I sound a little bitter, eh?  well, the other friend from work is pissed at me... why?  because I asked to change the dates of a camping trip...my bf's daughter's one year birthday party was scheduled for that day...well, now she is mad...can we say jr high?  I might even give her high school... this is the same girl that ditched us when we made plans to go to the bar, at the last minute, and never let me know.  this is the same girl that was mad at me when I told her I was diagnosed with PCOS (see a few entries previous)...why do I continue to make friendships with girls?  This is just not a good time for me...my bf and I haven't talked in well over a month...the other bf blew me off and has yet to call me back...I get so sick of this and I feel like this is the last type of stress I need right now.    I have been in so much pain lately...when I wake up...pain...when I go to bed pain...and most of the time, pain all between.  I have been trying to keep such a positive outlook on this, but I really don't know how much longer I can pretend it isn't there.  There are days I think I am going to fall flat on my face because my legs are so numb with pain...but I feel like I don't have a choice in my schedule.  I feel the worst for b.  He asked me the other day why I don't play with him...that breaks my heart.  I really need to focus on continuing to be a mom...i am so completely exhausted when I get home from work, but I should keep pushing, it isn't fair to him.  I try so hard to walk normally and pretend everything is okay...it is worse to try to explain to people what is going on.    I finally had a breakdown last week.  I think it was Thursday...my blood results came back and the dr wasn't there to talk to...the nurse couldn't tell me what they meant...I was exhausted, I was in pain, my friend had just gotten pissy with me...i just couldn't take it.  So, my other friend called for something and i didn't have it...and I just broke down.  How embarassing!  I am still trying to pull myself out of the funk.    It is so hard to allow myself to talk to someone about what is going on...I feel like they will think I am whining.  I am just at a loss as to what to do...my mom suggested walking on the treadmill.  I tried to explain how much I hurt, 'oh, my legs hurt too, but walking helps'...okay...that sounds like you have muscle pain...not the same thing, but of course, she is convinced it is exactly like her, because everything I do is exactly like her...frustration.  I can't admit I need help, but I can't continue to do everything myself either.  I just feel like crawling into a hole and hiding out for a long time...         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
518116,indUnk,"       I just finished reading through my past blogs...obviously, I have not a whole lot to do today...anyway...it is funny how I have the astounding ability to embarass myself.  The difference is, as of late, I can be the one laughing the loudest.  The sad thing is that I still do not have a great sense of self-esteem...but oddly enough, it is like I have accepted who I am and am at peace with it...don't get me wrong, I still have moments where I try to be someone for other people but I'm trying to get better with that...I need to stop trying to justify my actions and just respond 'take it or leave it, it is who I am and if you don't like it, there is the door'...  As for S...well, we are talking again.  It is weird...she has the same sick sense of humor and as a person who has had a past with ed, seems to be with me eye to eye on many levels...I don't think I can call her my bf...i think she just understands me more than anyone else in my life (girl friend wise).  I have gotten over the stealing thing...I forgive her but it makes me understand I need to be smarter than that and take it for what it is.  My other bf is getting married...I am bummed.  I was really hoping to see tickets go done so I could fly out there to be with him but it isn't going to happen.  So, I will see him for a minute or two at his reception here and go from there.  It will be interesting to see what his wife is like...supposedly, when S was talking to him, his fiance kepts making statements and finally t told her he would have to call her back...which makes me wonder if that is why he wanted to get off the phone as soon as she got home when we talked...S is dying for the reception...her mr x will probably be there and his wife is now pregnant so she wants me to try to get a picture...lmao!  I continually make changes to myself...and, hopefully, they are for the better.  It is truly amazing to see where I have been.  I think a lot of the growth with my emotional health can be accredited to the met.  I really feel like my hormones have finally leveled out and am able to stay even keel most of the time.  There was a time where I really thought I must be crazy...I couldn't understand what was going on or why I was so depressed...I'm starting to believe most of it was from the hormones going crazy...I feel like a new person and it is good to be here!

Oh well; I'll have to make a .jpg out of it and throw it up on a website somewhere so that everyone can see it. Heh.

470861,indUnk,"                  The Read Thru of Our New Play   &nbsp;  Last night at 7pm, we held the first read thru of our new play!&nbsp; 10 people showed up to be a part of the experience, including a playwright that we hadnt invited.&nbsp; We did our best at making the whole experience as professional, yet informal as we could.&nbsp; We distributed folders with a copy of the script, a ledger pad to take notes, and free pens for all!&nbsp; We also provided wine and beer to get everyone in the mood.  &nbsp;  We were all very nervous to show our work to these hand-selected folks.&nbsp; After two months of working very hard on our play, I think each of us was afraid that the play wouldnt be as mind-blowing as we had hoped.&nbsp; Overall, it went very well, but there were definite moments that made my face flush with embarrassment and frustration.  &nbsp;  First off, the girl who read the stage directions (which happens to be a HUGE part in our play) sucked ass.&nbsp; Ali barreled through the directions just to get them out of the way.&nbsp; Although everyone had a copy of the script in front of them, her lackluster performance caused everyone to tune out when she spoke.&nbsp; Because of that, I feel like they all missed out on some key character development moments.&nbsp; Ali used to work with us in the past, but since she quit the company, I have become so unimpressed with her level of passion and commitment.&nbsp; After last night, Im pretty sure I never want her to do anything for us or with us again.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In any case, the reading went well.&nbsp; I have such high respect for both Kelly and Meg (the other people who co-wrote the play with me).&nbsp; They were such troopers throughout the whole night and at the end, when they could tell that I was frustrated and a bit upset, they did everything in their power to turn my attitude around.&nbsp; They have made working with them a highly enjoyable experience.  &nbsp;  But Im getting ahead of myself.  &nbsp;  At the end of the reading we held a talk-back session.&nbsp; We received some wonderful compliments as well as some very thought provoking questions.&nbsp; I was extremely pleased with the level of effort everyone put in towards understanding our play.&nbsp; But then, HE spoke, the playwright we hadnt invited in the first place.&nbsp; This is the first thing that came out of his mouth: I really love the concept of your play.&nbsp; However, I took 18 pages of notes that I would like to share with you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For about 20 straight minutes (during which I took a bathroom break), HE gave us criticism after criticism.&nbsp; Sure, some of what he said was definitely beneficial to us.&nbsp; But I think I lost all respect for him when he pulled out a piece of paper and said, Im going to teach you guys a very simple lesson on writing.&nbsp; He proceeded to draw a stick figure.&nbsp; Next to it he drew a box.&nbsp; In between the box and the stick figure, he drew a lightning bolt symbol of sorts.&nbsp; In every play you need to have a person, a goal, and a problem.&nbsp; Once you have that, everything else falls into place.  &nbsp;  WHAT?!?&nbsp; WHAT WHAT WHAT?!?&nbsp; I sat there as politely as I could, but who did this kid think he was talking to?&nbsp; Im sorry, did I just pick up a pen yesterday?&nbsp; Did I spend two months working on a script, only to forget that I must have some sort of dilemma within the story?&nbsp; Is the play about 3 people who just sit and stare at each other for an hour?&nbsp; UGH.&nbsp; I was immediately pissed off and furious.&nbsp; WHO did this kid think he was?!?  &nbsp;  With my face beat red from fury, I thanked him for his comments and we closed the meeting.&nbsp; Yes, we surely have more work to do on the script.&nbsp; As we learned last night, there are a few holes and a few things we can expound on.&nbsp; However, I can guarantee you that the protagonist, antagonist, and resolution were so blatantly obvious that all HE did was prove he wasnt paying nearly enough attention.  &nbsp;  Anyhizafter the meeting, Kelly and Meg pulled me from the dredges of my disappointment.&nbsp; I do need to learn how to take constructive criticism better.&nbsp; I also need to lower my exceedingly high expectations of myself.&nbsp; Ive been trained as an actor, not as a writer, so of course there is still a lot I need to learn.&nbsp; I just dont need someone drawing stick figures to explain the mechanics of writing to me.&nbsp; suckmyballs.  &nbsp;  Angie and I hopped into a cab after the meeting and spent the next hour discussing the show.&nbsp; She went through all of her notes with me and we worked out some of the residual issues that I was carrying with me.&nbsp; I eventually ended up drinking a bit too much, shoving my face with chicken nuggets and grilled cheese when Paul got home and collapsed into bed around 2am.&nbsp; I woke up this morning gasping for a glass of water.&nbsp; I guess a pack of cigarettes and a bottle of booze will do that to you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So, we continue to write and rewrite and we move forward.&nbsp; Im SO glad we did the read thru and I am muchly grateful to everyone for joining us on this special occasion.&nbsp; I think Ill go home tonight, pull out my dolls, and try to teach myself how to be a better writer.  &nbsp;  If Barbie wants to marry Malibu Stacey, what issues will they have to overcome in order for that to happen?&nbsp; No, THINK Joe.&nbsp; You must have an issue for them to resolve.&nbsp; You cant just have them make-out for two hours.&nbsp; THATS not a play!  &nbsp;  For good measure, suck my hairy balls playwright extraordinaire!&nbsp;                 ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 &nbsp;  Crushes suck.&nbsp; When theres a crush situation, usually one person has the upper handnamely the object of the crush, who most likely doesnt have reciprocal feelings.&nbsp; Im always the one with the crush; Ive always felt like this is a handicap, even though Im not one to wear my heart on my sleeve.  &nbsp;  I hope I dont ever speak to, hear from or run into my old USSC.&nbsp; I cant even stand to hear/say his name nowadaysit makes me sad and a bit hurt (angry/bitter).&nbsp; Id much rather hate him now than remember how full of stupidity and hope I was, when I thought I was in (unrequited) love with him or that there was a slight chance he (at one time) might have been interested in me.&nbsp; Hell always be the one that got away, the unresolved unrequited crush, I suppose.  &nbsp;  I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.&nbsp; I hope you miss me.

We're trying to make ourselves more available by letting employers know they can email us, but I have a feeling that we need some other way for them to contact us.  Does anyone know of a free voicemail service?  We may even want to look at how much getting the phone company's voicemail system is.  At least there we could have calls transferred to our voicemail if we were online or busy.  It's funny, but I've asked the above question without doing an Internet search first.

4317011,Accounting,"                  urlLink    I'm zee blonde  urlLink     Ok, so this is my boyfriend Joshua and me. The picture was taken right before my company Christmas party in 2003. I work for Paramount Computer  urlLink http://www.pmount.com  which sells refurbished HP and Compaq equipment. I do the Accounts Payable  and  Receivable. Originally I was just Receivables, but the girl who did Payables  sucked . The problem though was that she was the 'company daughter'. She had been there almost since conception, starting off as a receptionist and moving up to A/P. She had been trying to attend college for the past 7 years. Would start off with a few classes, then drop down to one, and fail it. She was a total partier and even when she wouldn't have class until 2 in the afternoon, she couldn't get to work until 11am, work a couple hours, and then leave for her one class. So yeah, A/P was doing pretty badly, but they couldn't get rid of her, so they 'promoted' her to 'sales assistant' and split her duties up between me and two other people in the company. Our receptionist handles the credit card stuff, a guy who majored in Accounting but is actually in internet sales audits the freight, supply,and utility accounts, and I take all phone calls relating to A/P and cut checks for all the bills. It's fun, let me tell you....(sarcasm). It was pretty cool at first because the accounts were a   mess.   So I got to do all the researching and comparing what our vendors showed we owed versus what our aging displayed. I like all that kind of stuff, problem solving. But now A/P is in shape, so my job is pretty boring. Unfortunately, while doing A/P, A/R has slipped a tad bit. So now I get to focus on that side more and hound people for money. That is my least favorite part of the job. Being on the phone all of the time, given excuses with the run around...oh I can't wait until I get my orders to go to OTS! Get me out of this paper pusher hell!  Now back to Joshua, I would much prefer to talk about him. We met back in 1999. We both worked for United Video, which was eventually bought out by Blockbuster. He hated me at first, lol. We always joke about how I had a crush on another guy who worked there, and would always talk to Joshua about him. Joshua started getting pissed because he didn't want to hear 19 year old immature talk about this other guy. Instead of just stopping, I went on the attack and said 'You're just jealous because I don't like you!' That annoyed him even more and he pretty much ignored me after that. So what did I do? I began hanging out with Joshua's roommate so that I could find a way to be around him more often. Eventually Joshua and I became good friends and when he needed a place to live, he came and stayed with me. We've been together ever since...awwww.  But on that note, relationships suck. The only thing that keeps me going is the knowledge that ALL relationships have issues no matter who your with. We have had many problems and for the most part have worked through them. We have planned a life and a future together which I am looking forward to. If only the small day to day stuff didn't get in the way. In some ways I want to use this blog as a forum to bitch and moan and get stuff off my chest, but on the other hand I don't want to talk badly about my spouse. It's the way I am with so many things, I'm on the fence and sometimes I hop off on one side, and then I jump over to the other. Basically Joshua had a   really   hard time growing up. He has changed for the better in so many ways, but it still is not good enough for me or my family. He has progressed by leaps and bounds and knows it. He says he has put forth the effort and feels that now I should start changing for the better as well. Basically I need therapy. For what I'm not too sure. I have been dragging my feet, but it's something I know I need to do. Nothing is ever good enough for me and I can be a complete and total bitch. Is that something therapy can overcome? I mean Jesus, maybe I would be a happier person if he would get a job, or if he could complete one class at the local Junior College. Do I really need therapy, or do I need to get out of the relationship? If I seeked help for my emotional problems, would that give him incentive to not be so lazy? And I just hit the nail on the head. Why am I so worried about whether therapy will help  him  get motivated to keep changing? I need to do it for myself. I am a very competitive person, and it is coming through here. 'I am a better person than him, so why should I keep becoming better, he needs to catch up with me and  then  I can start growing as well.' It's just me being arrogant. Ok, enough of this, I just solved my problem. Thanks for reading!       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've missed London. Nice weather. Like those of Brisbane winter days. The weather is usually perfect during the week by rains and is cold on weekend.  I always love the coldness.  The first SMS he sent me was..  'beautiful gloomy day! our kind of weather'  sent on  24 May 2004  at  08:25:39.   It was the weather, and england that got us talking then.  I SMSed him, i wrote  'I suppose it all could have ended up differently but it didnt. If we ever have yet another chance, things would be different. I suppose it wont happens.'     It followed by  'I wonder, would we ever get to talk again? I've left the silence as it is. I might be leaving for England soon. Let's talk again before i leave, okay? answer me.'

4285714,Student,"   Well another day and things look no better.  I  really  appreciate those of you who left comments. It's really nice to have someone who understands and wants to strangle my hubby besides me. I am definitely going to check out the website that was suggested.  As for right out asking him if he's cheating....I know that won't work because I have no doubt that if asked he will say' no' whether he is cheating or not.  I'd like to think that he is not cheating but all the signs say that he is. Most of my suspicions are based on me being sneaky. I checked his cellphone while he was asleep and there was incoming and outgoing calls to the same number, many of them,  so being the nosy soul that I am, I called the number and got a voice mail for someone named Sabrina. That's the moment I decided that he was definitely cheating. He is supervisor of a large corporation and I know he talks to many people on that phone for business but this number stood out because there were so many of them. Now for the last week he's been coming home late every evening, he says there's a 'boiler' down at work but if I try to contact him at work I can't get him, that coupled with the fact that he's not speaking to me confirms it in my mind.  Geez loueeeze......I didn't start this blog as a means to whine and I don't want it to turn into that. I'm actually a strong person and I can make it on my own but it's not the making it on my own that's breaking my heart, it's the losing my husband. We have no common children, my daughters are 12 and 18 (yep! I started young ) , he is 8 years older than me and I was sure hoping that would mean that he would be more mature than the guys my age.............guess not! But he is very close to my kids and I don't want to shake up their world either with a divorce. He has kids of his own from a prior marriage, 23, 21 and 19 and we all get along wonderfully.  When we started dating, I was a full-time student working towards my AS in nursing. After we married I quit school to work (( I am a CDA (Certified Dental Assistant)  so that we could save up money to buy a house of our own, which we did 4 years ago. I haven't worked for the 2 years since I had all my surgeries and now I am ready to go back and finish my degree, I have half of the credits required to finish but alas now we  'don't have the money'  which I think is a load of BS, we have the money for everything else. So now I am thinking' I put my educatin on hold to get a home that will either go to him or be sold in the divorce (there's that overactive-imagination thing again) and I'm going to have to figure out how to raise my daughters on$13.00 an hour' which isn't gonna happen.  Soooo.............my plans are to go to the college on Monday and sign up for at least 2 classes and get a short term loan and then come the first of the month use his credit card to pay off the balance so I can get on with my life.  I'm not a sit back and sulk  kinda girl, I'm an 'okay, if this is how you want it then let's rumble' kinda girl. I'm still young (35) and attractive and have many years ahead of me to continue down this path we call life. I won't sit around and be put upon, if he's moving on then so am I.  So anyway.......Thanks for listening :o) and thanks again for the input. I agree with the passive agressive mentality of what he's doing and it sucks! Grow up already! I also agree that 'men suck'. I'm off to check out that website.  On a lighter note...my favorite time of year is here again. My daughter is a varsity cheerleader for her high shcool (as well as a senior this year) and next friday is our first footabll game. Go gators!!  I'm still trying to figure out how in the hell to put a list of other blogs on the left side of the screen, I've emailed blogger for help but no answer yet!!  Ta for now and live life to it's fullest!!!    Dawn  ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4284753,Advertising,"       I am getting a massage today. Hopefully my neck will be fixed :)  I bought 3 books at Barnes and Noble yesterday.  I don't know why I do that when I still have 2 unfinished books sitting around, one at the office and one by my bed.  These ones are  different  though...  I'll read them from start to finish.  Actually I don't remember the last book I read cover-to-cover.   Hmmmm?  Even Moneyball, which was the last book I read and totally got into, I skimmed.  ADD is a bitch.  I think that's why I prefer reading magazines.  I was really surprised (in a good way) to hear from Sean again.   I have the house to myself for 4 days.  Love it.  I have been banned or screwed up my account on ebay.  This is probably a good thing.  Good for my credit card in any case.   I need to start looking for a new apartment.

4281580,Military,"       Howdy all.  If you refer to my last post, you noticed that I rambled on about my two buddies Ryan and Bryon. Potentially this past weekend was to be great, as long as Ryan the flake came through. Rye and I were to meet Bry in Pamona at 1 in the afternoon. I am driving the 2 hour drive, when at 12:15 I get a call from Ryan. Bastard lives 4-5 hours away and he hasn't left yet. Was I surprised? NO. Was I pissed off? Not really. I arrive at Bryon's house at 12:50 because I am a reliable friend who is always on time. We contemplate taking bets on if the bastard is going to come or not. Not really wanting to lose my money, I decide against it.        Ryan shows up at around 6:00. He is lost 3 miles down the road in San Dimas. San Dimas High School Football rules! Anyway. We pick his ass up, and decide that we are going to go to one of Bryon's friends birthday dinner at 7. Ryan is a vegetarian. He doesn't even eat things that are made with eggs. Bryon and I are avid carnivores who will eat anything smaller than us. Where do we go for dinner? Outback. Hilarious. With the smell of sweet cooked animal in the air, Ryan is obviously perturbed. He starts arguing with mega bitch waitress about his salad. I don't know what her problem was, my guess she needs to get it in the butt. Anyway. Out of respect to Ryan I get a dish with Chicken. I figure its less offensive then cow. Bryon gets a steak salad. Bitchy waitress takes a couple hours to do just about anything so we head out to Dave and Busters for more drinks at around 10ish.   Dave and Busters are assholes about I.D. You cant get into the place without an I.D. which doesnt even make sense since they ask you for it at the bar again. Needless to say, one girl we were with forgot her's so her and her boyfriend didn't get to go. Assholes.  We continue to get our drink on and play stupid games. We play this virtual reality battletech game. Pretty sick.  Our pool table finally comes up. We decide to play girls against guys using slop. Big mistake. Those girls were so damn lucky, we lost the first 2 games pretty fast. One of the cocky girls we were with decided that it would be a good idea to start playing for something. Ryan offers to take off all his clothes and run naked. Not a surprise. We all come to the conclusion that there will be some clothes coming off, details to be hashed out later.   Now guys don't need alot of motivation when it comes to competition. You throw some boobies into any equation, and a guy becomes 10 times better at anything. We destroy the girls in 2 games. They do not live up to their bargain. Guess they werent very slutty. Damn.  We came home at around 3:30am and went to bed a little bit after that. Just like old times with 2 of my closest friends.   Seriously, I can go on forever but I'm guessing that only 2 or 3 people have even read this much. I will keep Sunday short. Went and saw 'Without a Paddle', ATE at the star of India. Chilled with Ryan until he left this morning. Good times, Good friends. I'm glad everything turned out alright.    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4280767,Student,"           I feel much better now...not so guilty. In another sense, I feel icky, really dizzy and my stomach's still kinda upset. but oh well. I can't believe I'm updating this again...it's the second day in a row!! of course, it is new....and I don't have to worry about anyone reading it....'spretty cool.  I can't wait for school to start, thank goodness for wednesday. Maybe I'm weird....I just want to be able to have some social contact (although, this is Recluse Lydia I'm talking about...) and stop hanging around being bored all day every day. Plus I'll get to drive, woohoo.  Speaking of driving, I should get my license tomorrow. I mean, I AM going to get my license tomorrow. I guess I should look over my rule-booky-thingy but I'm really not too nervous, I know the test and I know I'm a good driver, and I don't have to drive the manual for the test. So even though I haven't driven for a week or so, I still think I'll pass. I'd better pass, because I refuse to take the MTD and have to walk all the way to that bus stop, it's insane. sigh.  I hope my mum gets my clothing allowance taken care of tomorrow so I can get some jeans...I don't really have a pair I'm willing to wear to school. and I did my job, I figured it all out and typed it up and printed it and submitted it for her approval...so technically she should really take care of it. I wouldn't mind having some of the rest of thatstuff before school starts, either.  I wonder if she's just gonna let me use my credit card for my allowance this time. Even though it's not a cash card, but she keeps saying she trusts me, so...it's cool though, I feel so powerful with that thing. I think maybe I need to ask her to make 'emergency' more specific, lol...  once again, I have no idea how this post ended up so long. wow.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4256474,Student,"       The human being - Homo Sapiens. That is our species. We are all part of it, and we all share similar attributes. Yet every human being is unique, every single one is hugely different from the next. I'm not just talking about out phenotypes(what we can see, our physical attributes), or our genotypes(what's in our genetic code ie XY or XX for male or female). I mean that no matter how much we all think the same, wear the same clothes, eat the same food or breathe the same air, we can never be exactly like another human being. Twins may look the same, but usually have quite contrasting personalities (Anyone ever read any Sweet Valley Twins books? Or am I the only loser in the world...guess so...) Human beings are special, even the simplest of thought processes involves complex reactions in our brain that can produce all sorts of effects. And we do it so easily, without even thinking, we think! And try thinking about not thinking, its impossible! No matter how much you tell yourself to clear your mind, you end up thinking about not thinking, it's a scary thing... Humans have an incredible capacity to think, to invent, to create, to speculate, and its all there at our disposal. The World really is our oyster. Ever looked inside a computer? We created that, a human being worked such complexity out, its genius, its amazing, and it makes me feel proud to be alive. Sometimes I feel like I should be doing more with this immense capacity to learn. Studying does tend to be tedious, but its something that enhances our capacity to use our mind, and it's been essential to all the inventions we have now. Imagine if the inventor of the Toilet, Thomas Crapper (that's where the word crap comes from, I promise!), had decided he just couldn't be bothered to study (what he studied, I don't know, but I doubt it was called making toilets for dummies), and then didn't invent the toilet, the world wouldn't be what it is today! Sure, someone else might have invented it, but you never know. It feels like such a waste, that humans only use a third of their brains capacity, and even then we don't use that space much at all. Think of things we could do if we used our whole brain. Who knows, even telepathy might be possible. Think about how complex the gene code is, and how hard it was to decode, it is absurd to think that the human mind is capable of understanding something we cannot even see with the naked eye. We still don't understand so much, and there are so many discoveries still to be made. Yet it all hangs in the balance. So many things could happen that could lead to the end of the human race, that it is frightening to even think about. Ever taken the tube in London, and thought that at any time terrorists could attempt a bomb attack? It's scary, and sad, because for innocent people, who have nothing to do with angering these terrorists, death is unfair. What about a possible nuclear war? There are world leaders out there who with a simple command could initiate the launch of a nuclear missile, causing a war that would end up destroying the world. And those are just the human possibilities. Think about all the things that could happen in space that might unbalance the earth's orbit, and send it spinning to an untimely end? That would be the end of us. And it is possible, because as you read this, out galaxy is spinning around in an unpredictable path around the universe. One day it may be sucked into a black hole, or crash into another galaxy, or get caught up in a supernova, and we will have no say in what happens! That's why, you've got to be amazed at how lucky we are to be alive, at what a gift it is, to think how complex the human body is, and how we might not even have evolved if that fishy thing that climbed out of the water billions of years ago had decided it liked the water and couldn't be bothered to venture on to land. Okay, Okay, so there so it's a big if, but that's the beauty of it, anything COULD have happened, and what happened? WE did! For me, life is a beautiful thing, and I'm going to cherish and nurture mine. As for the capacity to learn and enhance my mind, well, its great, but I'm on holiday at the moment, so studying can wait...  PS - To those who dont agree that human's are indeed special, i say that our innate ability to find ways to survive and further dominate all the other species on this earth muct clearly desmonstrate our superiority. Just by comparing our gene codes with those of other species it is evident that there is something about us that makes us superior. Humans manged to build vastly complicated societies before they could talk, think of neanderthals. They could communicate, but not exactly talk in the way we can, and who says bees cant communicate. I agree that all living speices are something amazing, but to be human is to be top of the chain. Simply being alive, with all the mechanisms we have working all the time is a magnificent feat. The examples of a rabbit digging a hole and bees creating a community are comparable, but once compared seem dull and simplistic in contrast. Think of what we have achieved in order to be superior to nimals. We envied birds power of flight, we invented the aeroplane, the parchute, the hanglider and even the space rocket! We envied how fish could swim deep underwater, so we built the sumbmarine and learnt to scuba dive. And we are still learning, tahts what makes us so amazing, humans can adapt quickly, and learn and improve themselves in a way that animals can only do with much difficulty and on a much smaller scale. Humans rule the world and being one makes me feel special. Be proud to be alive. Be proud to be human.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4251564,indUnk,"                 Joshua Holland has an  urlLink alarmist article  up on  urlLink AlterNet  on “Why Conservatives Are Winning the Campus Wars” that contains this interesting statistic:  While progressive student groups are mostly self-funded, by the mid-1990s roughly $20 million dollars were being pumped into the campus Right annually, according to People for the American Way.   What does 'self-funding' mean? No PIRG funds? No grants? No school funds? Just tin-cup panhandling among the destitute proletariat? And how does $20M get 'pumped' into the campus Right? That's not 'self-funding'? They're being funded against their will? (Does a wealthy conservative go on campus and inveigle defenseless, naive students into starting conservative groups by promising them money?)   Then he trots out this shopworn little trope:   That money and expertise are directed at [among other things] demonstrating the liberal academic 'bias' that justifies many conservatives' reflexive anti-intellectualism.  So if you just define your political vision as the 'intellectual' approach, your adversaries become, ipso facto, troglodytes.

4236222,indUnk,"       I decided this would be fun. My opinions on:  Abortion: Yes. If I'm not having babies, who the hell am I to tell a woman that she has to have one?  Affirmative Action: Yes. People argue against it, and I bought it until I read a UChicago/MIT Study that basically proved that people with 'black-sounding' names like Jamal, LaToya and Chamique are 50% less likely to be hired, even with similar credentials, than are people with 'white-sounding' names like Tyler, Burt, and Natalie.  Age of Consent: Tricky. I guess 2 year difference makes sense, but put the age of consent at 15 unless the other partner is over 30.  Animal Testing: It depends. Shampoo, no. Things that cause cancer and such, to a limited extent, yes.  Death Penalty: Hell no. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.  Downloading Music/Movies: Hell yeah.  Decriminalization of Drugs: Marijuana, sure. I read somewhere that the reason pot was criminalized in the first place was because it was mistakenly linked to some guy's murderous rampage around the end of the 19th century. Hard drugs, no. On second thought, decriminalizing marijuana detracts from killer movies like 'Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle', so I'll have to call it a maybe.  Factory Farming: No. This country consumes WAY too much as is. Organic stuff tastes better, and while animals don't really have rights in my mind, torturing them is also not cool.  Free Trade: No. It leads to exploitation of third-world countries with different laws, encourages outsourcing of labor, leads to the dependence of third-world economies upon corporations. In short, not good.  Funding of Arts: Most definitely.  Gay Marriage: I don't know why this discussion happens in the first place... Denying gays the right to marry is like telling black people they can't marry white people. It's ridiculous, bigoted, and discriminatory. If that IDIOT Bush wants to protect the 'sanctity of marriage', he needs to make use of that rock he has instead of a brain and realize that something with 'sanctity' is connected to religion, and therefore SHOULDN'T be regulated by government in the first place. The whole argument is moronic... yes, a no-brainer.  Gun Control: Yes. Background checks are good, and I think all assault and automatic weapons should be banned. Who needs an assault weapon to hunt deer?  Immigration: In the age of terrorism, we need tough border restrictions, though recognizing the rights of illegal immigrants after background checks (to ensure that they're not terrorists) is also necessary.  Hardcore Pornography: Why the hell not? Deconstructing taboos is the first step toward true open-mindedness.  Human Cloning: Tricky, but yes, provided it's voluntary. Stem cell research also kicks ass.  Military Draft: Of course not. If people don't love the country enough to protect it, why should the government force them into service?  Minimum Wage: Yes, though it should vary depending on age (teenagers from high-class families get less compared to lower-class adults) and socioeconomic status (poor teenagers get more than rich teenagers).  Prostitution: Yes, with restrictions. Controlling STDs in prostitutes would be a good idea.  School Vouchers: No. It dodges the problem with our public schools, and the amount that kids from the failing schools get is laughably low, not nearly enough to pay for a half-decent private school. The voucher system, if instituted, would be just wasted money.  Taxes: Higher. Idiot Bush thinks advocating tax cuts to the richest is going to fix the economy? He needs to think again. EJ Dionne, Jr's Washington Post editorial this morning provided some fun statistics about the Bush tax cuts: The Office of Management and Budget (a federal office) reported that 1/3 of Bush's tax cuts went to people averaging $1.2 million in household earnings annually. Households with incomes in the top 1% received an average of  $78,460 , whereas those in the middle 20% averaged a cut of $1,090. For all of you keeping score, that's a 72-1 ratio for the rich.  RIDICULOUS.  United Nations: It's laughable as is, but needs to be revamped. Maybe it'll prevent dumb US presidents from taking unilateral action...  Universal Health Care: Of course. At least until drug prices go down. A family without healthcare would literally bankrupt itself without some type of coverage.  War on Terrorism: Necessary, but should be defensive, not pre-emptive. The active component of the War on Terrorism should be deconstructing the mindsets and actions that lead to terrorism: fundamentalist Islam, imperialist action by the US (yes, we should take some of the blame), and lack of education.  Welfare: Yes. Unlimited for those who are handicapped in some way, capped for those who are too lazy to get work.       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4234833,indUnk,"       Urine Constituents  Urinalysis is one of the most powerful diagnostic tools used in the medical field today. Hundreds of tests can be performed on individual urine to determine the condition of the donor. Urine contains thousands of different types of compounds. It is literally the aqueous trash of the body. A cup of coffee has over ten thousand compounds alone. Drug testing laboratories have narrowed the choice down to two or three tests for determination of a suitable sample. If the urine sample falls out of the parameters the sample will be labeled 'too dilute, unsuitable, or adulterated' depending on which parameter is incorrect. pH - is a relative measure of acidity or basically, with a range of 0-14. In the middle is 7.0 which is considered neutral. Acids have low pHs usually less than 1. Bases, such as bleach have high pHs around 10.5. Urine samples must have a pH in the range of 4.5 - 9.0. Both acids and bases will destroy drug metabolites, so the labs check to see if any are present. If a chemical additive is used, it should leave the pH relatively unchanged, within the 4.5 - 9.0 ranges. Specific Gravity (SG) - is a fancy word for density. Simply drinking tons of water can fool a drug test. By measuring the SG a lab can detect if the donor is trying to beat a drug test by dilution. If the sample is too dilute, the SG of the urine sample will be below 1.005 g/ml. A lab result like this might come back as inclusive; test not performed, or sample too dilute. It is against the law to fail an individual for providing sample(s) which are too dilute. On the flip side of the coin is high density. If a sample has a density above 1.020 g/ml, then an additive has been used. It is considered proof of adulteration if the SG is at this level and is legal to fail an individual for having a SG above 1.020 g/ml. Creatinine - is a measure of kidney functions to determine how dilute or concentrated a urine sample is. The creatinine has to be below 20 mg/dl for the sample to be considered too dilute. Creatinine levels above the 20 mg/dl are considered acceptable. Creatinine is found in all muscle tissue and originally begins as creatine. Creatine passes through the body in two ways. First is consumption as it is found in all types of meat. The second is production by the body. As muscles are broken down and rebuilt creatine is converted creatinine. Creatinine in high levels is toxic, and so the kidneys filter out the creatinine from the blood and pass it on to the bladder. Creatinine extraction from the blood is at a very constant rate and the level in the urine is constant varying only with the length between urinations. Therefore creatinine levels less than 20 mg/dl indicate a bladder which is continually being emptied in an attempt to pass a drug test. Labs sometimes look at other constituents of urine with a ten-panel dipstick called a multistick. The ten tests on the multistick are: 1. Leukocytes2. Nitrite3. Urobilinogen4. Protein5. pH6. Blood7. Specific Gravity8. Ketone9. Bilirubin10. Glucose     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope it is helpful. :) when I am finished here I will go work on some more hats. (I have only had a few donations, I hope things pick up.) I have made two out of tan alpaca. One is felted, shaped and dried. It's a rolled brim style. I finished knitting the other last night. I will try to get around to felting it later on today. I think I will move on to some a little simpler in style and color. I think I'll use the good old acrylic left overs from my stash. I have a nice variegated lavender, purple, green, and white and pair it with a solid lavender. Yeah! That's my next hat. As soon as I figure out how, I will add some pictures of my hats.

Aerocrow  and  Xcalibur : The Beginning    Here is probably the very first picture I have ever taken.   Aerocrow   is a   WAR   and I am a   MNK  .

Lumiere   (Aerocrow) and   Max   (Xcalibur).  As for today's post...  Yesterday night was very awesome.   Purrti  ,   Haites  , and I headed to the dunes and proceeded to build a pt. Within minutes we were fighting crabs along   Siren Beach  . After about 4 hours of pting and 2 deaths (sorry guys), we are all level 16. I have learned   Divine Seal   and   Curaga  . Nice. And, of course, level 30 is that much closer.  Tonight, since   Haites   won't be on (douche), I will be hopefully getting a pt in the dunes with my   BLM  . If all goes well, I will get at least level 15 tonight (currently level 11) and be done leveling my   BLM  . If things go  really  well, I will get level 17 and be able to have   (  Warp  )  , but that is highly unlikely.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4214747,indUnk,"             Lately I've been sleeping on the floor for about the past 2 weeks. I've come to realize that it may not be the best way to sleep. Which brings me to an entirely different question.    What did people way back when, such as Adam and Eve, sleep on? Leaves for clothing....I doubt they had a pillowtop california king mattress to catch some zzzzz's.    I found the floor very comfortable for about 10 days. Now it seems to be hindering me more than helping. Maybe it should be done in moderation. Nonetheless, I shall try the futon again.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4209555,Military,"             Let me take you through an ordinary day for me - at least ordinary until I start up school again in a couple weeks. I woke up bright and early....I think it was around 12:30pm. I would have slept longer had it not been for the sun and his evil rays invading my bedroom and pillaging the darkness I had hidden myself in. So, I gathered myself for a moment and rolled over onto the floor. With my face pressed into the carpet and my ass pointed straight up posed to do battle with the sun's evil rays, I slowly came to my senses. I wiped the crusties from my eyes and blindly stumbled for the bathroom. Very rarely does a day go by where I do not inflict some sort of physical damage on myself. Sometimes these feats of daring are intentional, other times they are not. This day would be no different.  It began simply enough. My roommate was already up. We will call him Kiwi since he hails from New Zealand and apparently that is what they go by. I don't think I've ever called him by his rightful name, nor do I really have any desire to do so. He sat motionless watching TV as I banged my shoulder in my first attempt at getting through the bathroom door. My other eye opened at that point and things became much easier.  I only had minimal time to do my daily rituals of shit/shave/shower before I had to hasten to work. Work was about 40 minutes away and began promptly at 3pm. So I had about an hour and change to do the necessities. Plenty of time.  Work was something I really didn't enjoy all that much - not that everyone loves their job, but I'm working for my sworn enemy - not many people can say that I don't think.  I really don't care for structure all that much.  I don't like stupid people, though I myself can sometimes fall into that category.  I don't like arrogant people who are put in charge based solely off of their time in their job and how they scored on some fucking test.  People shouldn't just be given responsibilities based solely on these merits.  Shit, some of the people that have been appointed over me wouldn't know their ass from a hole in the ground....as cliche as that sounds, its the damn truth.  Ignorance if fucking bliss.  But alas, I am forced to deal with these things day in and day out.  I can't really quit....not without going to jail anyway.  Yeah, if you haven't guessed by now, I'm in the military.  The branch of service is not important - they're all pretty much run just the same.  Me being of the ilk I described above working for the military seems kind of a paradox, much like braille on a drive up ATM machine.  However, it is just a means to an end and I play their game.  After all, the schooling is free and they offer to take a chunk out of my school loans which I had accumulated in my first attempt at a responsible lifestyle.  So into work I go.  Today wasn't anything special - a lot of people gone on leave today and only a small handful of us left over.  I think the one hilight of my night came when I threw small plastic caps (dust caps for electronic equipment) at the blonde I work with.  This was your typical junior-high flirtation at its worst.  It did not go without reward though - although not as I planned.  One of the caps landed on a table between us.  I got up out of my rolly chair to grab it before she could use it against me.  In the process of lunging forward, my chair rolled out from under me.  When I failed to acquire the dust cap, I jumped back to where I thought the chair was.  However, my luck being what it is, the chair wasn't there.  It had moved slightly back and off to the side and I think I could even hear it snicker as my arms flailed madly for that brief second before impact.  There I lay on the floor staring up at the ceiling tiles, the echoes of laughter filling my ears.  Well, it could have been worse I guess.  At least someone was entertained.  So....that was about it.  I won't bore you with the details of my work.  I'll just say it consists of butting heads with some of the more ignorant people placed above me.  I can't wait for school to start up again.  I'm between semesters now and I need something to take my mind off of this mindless crap.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4208071,Student,"       Heres a few thoughts about Nelly's Tip Drill video just because I can.  I got this video from my boy steven (aka porn boy). So thanks for the hook up bro.  You thought a Nelly MTV-friendly video was bootilicious?  Some a these gals have cheek coming a good foot off the haunch. After the first few versus's you'll quickly see why calling a girl 'tip drill' is both a compliment and a cut down at the same time. The St. Lunatics(I asume thats who they are), and Jermaine Dupri get to be a part of this almost porn affair and seem very happy for the opportunity.  Obviously some of these tip drills are dancers ‘cause the booty control says professional. The gal with the leg behind her head needs my number. And when Nelly swipes his credit card between two perfectly globular cheeks this whole video has been charged to the game. I give it a 9/10. Definately one my all time favorite videos at this point.   Sex tip of the day- yeah I know I already gave a few earlier but what the hell. Most women do NOT like doggystyle...Tis a shame I know.

4197354,Publishing,"            I pee allot …..In fact Im pretty sure that I pee more than any one human being should in one day. “Why do you pee so much Larry?” you ask. Well for one I drink damn near a gallon of water every day at work… now you may be thinking to yourself “ Damn that’s a shit load of water” .. And you know what your probably right. But I get really thirsty so fuck off…Secondly I just started taking some new diet pills. For those who aren’t in the  know, one of the main things that diet pills do aside from giving you heart attacks is they act as a diuretic. Not diuretic as in “ I farted but Im pretty sure I just shit myself” but more of a “ Every time I pee its clear” diuretic.  So where am I getting at… Ok so here’s the story .  On one of my many trips to the bathroom today I witnessed something that took me as being a bit strange. As Im walking into the bathroom to use the urinal there is a elderly gentleman doing his business as usual. Now this isn’t ordinarily out of place but this old guy had a technique for wizzing into a urinal that I personally have never seen used in practice. Now most guys myself included will hold their wang with one hand directing the flow of wee-wee while allowing their free hand to either hold their pants to prevent  getting piss on them, or to support themselves by using it as a brace against the wall. This old guy did neither.     As I walked into the restroom  I glance over at the old fellow and I swear to God  he was taking a leak using NO HANDS!!!!… Imagine if you will an old white guy at least 70 years of age taking a wee while mid Macarena. I couldn’t believe it. Now I know the majority of people reading the Blog ( Grace, Jules) Have never had the pleasure of being able to pee standing up. Well let me tell you this you need to control your dong when you pee.. Believe me I know… Ive tried the No hand technique before out of sheer morbid curiosity. Let me put it this way, have you ever turned on a water hose full blast while having left it unattended?  Yeah that’s what its like… not a pretty sight I assure you.  But some how this dirty old man was able to pull it off with out getting a drop on my shoes.. Hell I guess 70 years of experience may have helped a little bit.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4196367,Non-Profit,"       watched the olympics opening ceremonies this evening. it's amazing how many nations were represented, some i'd never heard of before. they're on the lookout for terrorists, my mother told me. good old mom, always keeping me abreast of the worst-case scenarios.   anyway, i realize terrorism isn't a joke, but it's become that ubiquitous condition of our times. its like, 'the call for tomorrow is: hot and humid with a chance of rain and possible terrorism.' i think the belief in fear itself and the advertisement of this belief is, in and of itself, a form of terrorism. i hate that new commercial with bush and wifey where he says something about 'choosing which child to find first on sept. 11.' he can just SIT there in his recliner and glibly sneak this gem into the palpitating hearts and bombarded minds of  terrorized  americans!! it makes me want to yak.   i'm not freaking out b/c i've been freaking out all my life anyway. on bad days i'm a malfunction. on good days i breathe and pay attention. and on great days, well...i fantasize about being a misunderstood prophet. in reality though, i'm just a lightning rod for whatever's around me. i'm empathy to the point of overkill. i'm just annoying. geez, i can't even commit to being a proper narcissist.   i fantasize about being in love. i touch my cheek and pretend its someone else but it never, ever feels like it. everybody is getting married. if they aren't married, they're cohabitated. if they're not cohabitated, they're dating. and if they're not dating, they're single  on purpose.  the cheese stands alone.

4194876,indUnk,"          So, last Friday seems to be the beginning of the end for me literally. Getting ready for work at 7am I happen to shut my bedroom door only to hear 'CRASH, CRACK, SNAP!', yes friends and foes (those who will enjoy this story no less) that was the sound of my bedroom mirror crashing to the floor and breaking into a thousand pieces. Needless to say, seven years of bad luck is not what I need at this point and time in my life. After having my heart broken in about the same manner a week prior to this I was sure nothing worse could happen. Well, considering I was stuck with the guy for two days after crying my eyes out and then catching poison ivy maybe this will seem like cake.              WRONG!!!

So, I figure ok, make some breakfast and things will be fine .....no, again. As I'm making my egg whites, the sleeve of my bathrobe catches on fire. Sure sign at this point I'm pretty much going to die. I manage to stop the flames and proceed to get my frazzled ass in gear for work........ugh!              Get to work and my ex-boyfriend, we'll call him MP (for Multiple Personality), a man, I mean little boy with emotional problems, that had dumped me a year earlier after returning from Paradise (Barbados) on instant messenger, writes to me to say that He's sorry and would like to call me to discuss......WTF! Yeah, ok...because obviously I must be sitting here thinking of you after over a year...nooooooooooooooooo. I've been through at least 50 dates plus since and one guy I truly liked since the fact.....I've moved on and you should too!               So in one day, I broke a mirror (causing the bad luck), caught on fire, and was apologized to by the most irrational person on earth.....so just when I think its all said and done MP's best friend calls me Sunday night to ask me out on a date (we'll call him Social Climber, because he promotes and thinks he's 'big time'). How about NO!              So Monday rolls around and I'm walking to work. It was nice outside, the air was good, the sun was shining, the usual Queens Greeks were drinking their cappuccinos and smoking bad home made cigarettes at the corner cafe and a man was outside doing his morning jog, or so I thought...as I'm walking up the subway steps to get to work he runs up the stairs behind me and grabs my ass....not a little pinch either a full on up the butt, in the crack, grab the whole cheek type of grab..........as I turn around to beat him with my purse (as any normal nyc woman would respond) he runs down the steps but stops to pull down his pants and flash me........oh happy monday to all!!!!!              Also, the man of my dreams, who didn't mean to break my heart has called me twice (because we have decided to stay friends) and both times I've missed the call in a matter of a minute.

Fucking hell I'm beginning to sound like some old tosser, maybe its just because I work in a pub and see the negative side of it more than I do the positive (of which there are many, beer for example has been helping ugly people get laid since 1845)  My mate and his girlfriend have split up, now this has been on the cards for a while and I think the only thing keeping them together was the fact that they own a house together, but they have finally gone their separate ways and parted company, except that they haven't. They have decided to keep the house for the sake of their investment and for my mates dad who would be otherwise made homeless. So they are going to sleep in separate rooms, except that there not because me and the girlfriend haven't moved out yet, so there they are two single people spending every night in the same bed, and just for good measure Sunday morning after they had both been out on the piss the night before they hopped on the good foot and did the bad thing at her request I might add. Which you may think is alright after all they are two single people with no commitments or attachments but surely that is not the way to split up with someone.  Anyway my original point was about people drinking so now I will get to it, it has been over a week now since they split up and I don't think the girlfriend (well ex-girlfriend anyway) has spent a night out of the pub since and not even that she has started smoking loads more dope than she normally does. Maybe it's just me but what's the fucking point its not actually going to do anything or make things better is it for fucks sake and its not even as though she is going to the pub to see her mates and has a few drinks cos and I'm not having a go here but she hasn't really got any mates except my girlfriend and a few others none of who are going down the pub with her.  Why are people insistent that alcohol makes things better it fucking doesn't all it does is makes you think about something else for a few hours then you wake up in the morning feeling like shit and the problem is still there, and half the fucking time if your trying to drink to forget something then chances are something will remind you of what you are trying to forget and then you will be a fuckload worse cos your all pissed and emotional so the thing that is supposed to be helping you feel better in fact ends up making things worse. Why the fuck can't people just deal with things and move on and to quote the streets 'Dry your eyes mate - there plenty more fish in the sea' ex-fucking-actly have a good cry or mope about for a bit whatever then get on with it. alcohol to me is a way to enjoy yourself and make a good night better its not a fucking magic drug that makes you forget everything fuck if that's what you want then go get some fucking rohypnol.  Anyway back to my mate. He on the other hand has taken it quite well and I think this is because he didn't really want to be with her anyway by texting, phoning all the single girls in his phone book and going out clubbing and attempting to shag anything that moves (and a few things that don't). I think the reason he has slipped back into this single male slag lifestyle so well after four years of being in a relationship is because he hasn't really stopped. He was still going out at the weekend and trying to shag anything that moves and texting, phoning all the girls in his phonebook, the only difference now is that he doesn't have to hide his actions from a possessive overbearing girlfriend.  She however is now tentatively taking the first steps toward a new relationship with the local friendly drug dealer. Who better for a pothead to go out with than the gut that keeps her in weed? Now I don't really know the guy but I have met him in the pub a few times and to me he seems like a bit of a bellend, hey they should get along just fine.  Returning to an earlier point my mate is very obviously on to a bit of a good thing here because he goes out tries to shag and succeeds or not as the case may be, so goes home at the end of the night and climbs into bed with his ex who then tries it on with him! You show me a single man in this country that would turn down that opportunity and I my friend will show you a liar! But how do you think the new man in her life feels o.k so they aren't together and haven't slept with each other but still there is something there and they have been on a few dates and it is probably only a matter of time, so he takes her out for dinner they have a good night he walks her home gives her a kiss goodnight and the next thing he knows is she has hopped into bed with her ex-boyfriend and if anything happens or not is beyond the point it can't be a very nice feeling knowing the woman that you want to be with is sleeping next to another man.  Enough moaning for now. Later     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, well, well. We had nothing of that. Best burger? If this is true, tell me:  - How can you put a price tag on the ONE hamburger that is the best in Chicago? If the one I am eating is the best, does that mean the one the guy next to me is eating is not quite as good? Or is it better? I want to know! The name is misleading. It should be the 'best hamburger s  in Chicago.' Fix it.  - The only way a burger can be deemed 'the best' is if it has been eaten. If it's not eaten, then what was it, the best-looking burger? best smelling? And don't tell me they could eat half of the burger and tell. What if the second half is grossly undercooked, or has a large squirming tapeworm in it? Human finger? Didn't anyone else see that episode of Buffy? Therefore you cannot base the quality of an individual burger. The name should now be ' Chicago's best burger recipe(or preparation). '  - I live in Minneapolis. How am I eating Chicago's best burger if I'm not in Chicago? This is not Chicago's best burger. It may be the best burger FROM Chicago; and since it's not the burger that is the best, but the recipe, it is in actuality the ' Best burger recipe(or preparation) FROM Chicago. '  - But wait! Who is to say it's the best? It is not mathematical, it was voted. Not only was it voted, but it was voted by an uneven representation of demographics!

4161674,Student,"             WARNING:  POTENTIAL 'SPOILERS' AHEAD!  Just got done watching the movie 'The Fisher King' - loaned to me by our own Gizmonic Guy.  Now, I don't want to give away too much of the plot, because I AM recommending this flick to any who might not have seen it yet.  In a nutshell, it tells the story of a VERY self-centered radio 'shock-jock' (think Howard Stern - but with a harder edge).  Jack has the 'perfect life' until one of his cold-hearted bits of advice to a regular listener results in disastrous consequences.    Racked with guilt at what he inadvertently causes as a result of his mean-spiritedness (a mass murder and suicide), Jack ends up on skid row.  In fact, if it weren't for the tender mercies of the woman who takes him into her home and into her heart, he would be totally out on the street.  One night, after getting particularly 'liquored-up', Jack ends up on the wrong side of town.  He is accosted by two young hooligans who decide to douse him in gasoline and set him on fire.  Fortunately, he is rescued by the not-altogether-there homeless guy, Parry (played brilliantly by Robin Williams).    The story continues by telling the tale of how Jack tries to 'make it up' to Parry, whose wife was lost in the aforementioned murder/suicide.  Jack actually becomes a compassionate person - perhaps for the first time in his life.  He (for a time at least) ends up meeting and helping out others who, not unlike Parry, are less-fortunate and/or down-on-their-luck.  By way of review, I've got to say right off the bat that this is by no means a 'perfect' movie. It definitely could have done with a bit of judicious editing here and there, IMHO. Nonetheless, it was a brilliant story and had some great performances in it.  I thought Mercedes Ruehl (as Jack's girlfriend) was particularly good - which makes sense, I guess, seeing as how I understand that she took home an Oscar for her trouble!   Beyond all that, I thought that the themes explored in the film were exceptional!  In a lot of ways, this movie dealt with some of the basic tenets of Christianity (compassion for others, true love vs. superficial love, forgiveness, self-sacrifice, redemption, etc.), however I doubt you'll ever find it on the shelf at your local Christian bookstore.  ...Which is sad, really.  It bugs me that 'Christian entertainment' always has to be so antiseptic and whitewashed.   I wish the Christian filmmaking industry could get off their holier-than-thou butts and make some movies that would really speak to the people.  Here's what I say...meet people where they live and stop making it look like that in order to be a Christian you have to come from a smiling, happy, well-dressed, successful, middle-class, two parent and 2.5 kid family - one whose biggest 'adventure' never takes them too far out of the 'burbs.   This is where my own attitude has changed in recent years I guess.  I used to buy into the idea that all Christian media had to be 'wholesome' and have strict 'family values'.  Now that I'm older and more mature - and have been through some rather painful life changes - I realize that we as Christians need to admit that this is an imperfect world that we live in; and that to ignore the hurt and pain and suffering that are going on all around us is to deny the true message of Christ!   Jesus didn't hang out with the wealthy people of his day.  He wasn't hanging out in the suburbs with the middle-class Jews, enjoying some delicious backyard barbecue and Canaanite Cola out by the pool!  No...he was hanging out with the lepers, the prostitutes, the down-on-their-luck, the sinners!  How we as Christians today have gotten away from that simple truth, I REALLY don't understand.   This is where I butt heads with those who want the church to be a 'museum for saints' instead of a 'hospital for sinners' (as my favorite radio preacher, Pastor Greg Laurie, would put it).  Some pastors and church leaders want a tidy little whitebread church where they can show up every Sunday morning seeing well-scrubbed, well-dressed middle class white folk sitting in the pews, hands folded neatly in their laps, waiting to absorb every word that he or she 'brings down from the heavens'.   Meanwhile, some of us (including the extraordinary people behind this 'blog') see the hurt and the poverty and the neglect that is taking place all around us - and we want to reach out in Christ's love to those who are affected.  The gospel, after all, is a message of hope.  Those who are comfortable and happy don't really need hope, now do they?   All right, I'll get off my soapbox now.  Guess I just got all fired up after watching 'The Fisher King'.  Whaddayaknow...I guess this film touched me pretty deeply.  Amazing, isn't it, that God can use a secular movie to make me feel like I need to seek after him more closely?  But then again, that's His style, isn't it?  ...Using the 'foolish' things of the world to confound the wise?  (1 Corinthians 1:27)   Check this movie out sometime.  See if it doesn't make you think (at the very least) or maybe even change your worldview (at best)!           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4160359,Technology,"       Amanda Parsons is a girl I know from high school.  She is probably technically in the 'Woman' category by now.  I haven't talked to her since I moved to Tennessee back in the late 90s.  Why did I suddenly think of her?  Because of the Presidential Elections.  She always said that she was going to be the first Female President of the United States.  She said the only thing that would stop her is if some other woman got voted in before she became of legal age.  I believed her.  If I ever find out that she is running, I'm going to vote for her.  I don't even know what party she is associated with.  But back in the 7th grade, I believed her.  I believed that she really would be President some day.  She was smart.  She had personality.  She had a a good heart.  That most of all is what I want in a president.  Smart and good-hearted.  Bush doesn't have either one.  If she still has those qualities, I would still vote for her.  In all actuallity, she probably doesn't want to be President anymore.  No doubt age and experience have left her jaded to the concept of Politics.  Changing the world is probably not on her agenda.  She may even have a kid or two by now that take up her entire life.  But if she ever ran, I would vote for her.  I've never voted before, and I don't plan to vote this year, but for her, I would.  Because I believe that she would be a good president.  Thats all.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4150820,indUnk,"        urlLink Accuser files civil lawsuit against Kobe Bryant; experts say it could cripple criminal case : 'said their client was owed money for pain, 'public scorn, hatred and ridicule' she has suffered as a result of the alleged attack last summer. '  This is just rediculous. I can't believe the grounds under which someone can sue another person. She is suing him because there is a question of her moral standing...and the American public may know that she is a slut. Hmmm...whose fault is that may I ask.   I wasn't in the room with these two but I have to question the character of a woman who would go alone in a hotel room of a married man... and not just any man, a successful and famous one. I guess I would make a poor juror for the prosecution. It's sad to know that in a day where the information about what is need to prosecute a rapist is out there and this woman may have failed to gain enough conclusive evidence to put her attacker behind bars.  I have to say that I'm not really on this girl's side. But, on the other hand, I'm not totally on the side of Bryant. He was so in the wrong for even putting himself in a position like that. He too has failed to learn the lesson set forth by other superstars.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4149882,indUnk,"                 Well after a break from the heat, it is getting hot here again. My little son has decided that he want to wear his overalls (the long pants kind). He never liked them before, but today, when it is hot, he wants to wear them. Go figure. I took the kids to swimming lessons today so they got a chance the cool off and play.  While they were doing that, I sat in the shade and cast on for my  urlLink shapely tank . The yarn I am using is Berroco's Cotton Twist color # 8311 which is a nice shade of red. I had originally bought the yarn to make the Chevron Tank, but decided that the yarn wasn't suitable for that project. Since the yarn itself is great yarn, I decided to switch projects.       I did a lot of casting on this weekend. I cast on for my  urlLink Kyoto  -- the yarn for this project is Casecade Yarn's Pima Silk. It is a very nice feeling soft yarn. I love the way it feels. I joined the second Kyoto knit-along. It will be nice to see all the finished kyotos out there.        The absolute best thing about today is that my husband and I got a year's of free gym dues. We are starting a digital photography business specializing in panoramic photographs. We did a set of panoramics free for our gym so that we could use them on our website as an example of our work. They loved them so much that they asked if we would do panoramics of their other two gyms. So they are giving us free dues in exchange for the photoshoots. Woo Hoo!! Our first paying customer.  Sadly, tomorrow is the last time DS will have a session with his speech therapist.  He is turning 3 on Saturday and will be too old for the Birth to Three program.  He did qualify for the developmental preschool at our public school.  So he will get more speech therapy, but not from Laura.  We'll miss Laura and hope we can keep in touch with her as friends.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4149439,HumanResources,"             It took some getting used to finding out that my boss is younger than me.  She's a nice enough person, but pretty flaky at times.  Luckily, she's easy going & me and the other gal in my dept can get away with cracking jokes at her expense.  She walks right into them & it's hard to keep our mouths shut sometimes.  Easy target.  I've been working on an online Exit Interview form that loads the data directly into a database.  So, I had to keep entering sample data to make sure everything worked right.  I told her I had quit about 8 times that day and that based on the ratings I put it, she wasn't doing very well as a manager.  I wasn't even looking at what the numbers meant that I was entering, just making sure all the fields worked.  But she was both offended and amused at the same time.  She said she was going to do one of those 360-feedback sessions to find out what we really thought about her.  I don't know about you, but how can you really be totally honest about your boss in a feedback session like that without it coming back to haunt you later on?  And my department isn't big enough to absorb the feedback & make it relatively anonymous.    Should be interesting to see what happens.  She told us she's back on her medications again.  Her sister was murdered last year by a boyfriend and needless to say, it's been very hard on the family & my boss especially.  Though I sympathize with her wholeheartedly, I still think there needs to be some separation between home & work.  It can make for some rather uncomfortable moments when she starts to reminisce or talk about what's going on with the trial, the family, etc.    I really do enjoy my job though.  I've carved out a little niche for myself & am happy with the outcome.  I've always been a computer geek, but never felt like I had enough experience to actually get an IT job.  Instead I putter around in Human Resources, but enhance my role in the department by creating webpages, a dept website, and other websites.  Right now, I'm finishing off a new website for Career Development.  This one is going to be pretty high profile and will get a lot of attention, so let's hope all the links work correctly!  My boss leaves me alone for the most part, which is good.  Compensation & Benefits is the part of HR I'm in, though I really only do the benefits part, while my boss & the other 3 gals do all of the compensation stuff.  So, I really have little in common with what they do.  Works ok for me though. We found out today that we may be moving into our new facility earlier than expected.  That'll be nice.  It's closer to my house & a much better facility.  The only downside is that our department will all be in one big room basically.  They've eliminated most of the offices & it's going to be very loud in there.  Get a few recruiters & the trainers going on phone calls & you can barely hear yourself think.  Might have to bring my headphones with me.             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mostly because the guys who are serious about it often make a lot of noise when they train, are big and scary-looking, and are  urlLink brutally strong .  Some are using steroids, some are not.  Some truly are obnoxious assholes.  But the majority are either misunderstood because of a lack of social skills or simply mistreated because people tend to judge them based on a stereotype rather than actually getting to know the person.  Hug a powerlifter.  Ask him if it's OK first, though.  If you're a   urlLink hottie , just jump the guy and hug him to death.  We don't get a whole lotta action most of the time.

4139413,Student,"   Yesterday I spent the day cleaning house and watching sappy movies on the Lifetime Movie Channel. Actually I watch one that was pretty good, but the rest were just sappy. I didn't go anywhere, do anything, was barely on the computer at all. Today I have felt like crap. I have been dizzy and light headed all day. I went in for physical therapy, but didn't finish it all. When I got home, in the mail I found the letter from SSI finally. The day has gone down hill from there. I knew I was going to be denied. I don't have a problem with that at all. I am no longer disabled! I am happy that I am no longer disabled! I want to be able to take care of myself. BUT! I can't get any straight answers out of the SS department about what the bottom line of my status is. The paperwork sent me today said that I was a possible canidate for continued benefits under the 301 program. But in another place it said that I AM elegible for continuation under the 301 program. I went in to talk to someone about it. I called twice about it. No one can tell me for sure if I will have an interuption in benefits or not. I HAVE to know and beable to provide documentation so I can have my HUD refigured and apply for food stamps.

Well, I did some regrettable things: 1.  I told Matt how I feel about him, even after all this time, and then I kissed him.  He pulled away, walked away and the next day, he remembered NOTHING, not a SINGLE thing I said or did!  I felt so sick, so damn REPULSIVE!! 2.  I stayed when Kim left; I should have left with.  #3 explains why. 3.  I made out with Marcus, after trying to hook him up with Kim.  I only hit on him AFTER he told me about the French kiss between Kim and Matt!  We got close to sex, but suddenly he was blew me off!!  He told me, nicely I guess, to get out of his car.  He said we should go back inside.  Hey Amy, REPULSIVE much? 4.  Rob and Walker were flirting with me.  Eww!  Rob’s weird and sleeps with his eyes ½ open, and Walker’s like my dad’s age!             I should explain.  I’m naive when I drink.  No, I’m friendly, that’s how I see it.  I’m a happy drunk!!  But Kim says I’m a drunken slut.  Josh says I’m basically I’m a drunk naive bitch.  People who are my friend or my sibling’s friends just see me as a fun drunk!             I saw Sarah though; she’s about to graduate from ECU.  I also saw Deena Szary; she goes to ECU also.  I also met two guys, Josey and Ander.  They’re black (so of course nobody wanted drunkard Amy around them); they were so cool.  Josey sounds like a talk show announcer; Ander was really quiet, but had sweet almond eyes.             April 20th- I saw the old trailer park; there were lots of changes.  Mama’s pissed at me for not leaving with Kim.  Don’t worry, Mama, I am too, but more so!  I missed Jonny’s first Easter.  Mama says,  “Did you forget you have two kids at home?”  “Its nice to see you’d rather not be spending Easter with them!”              Why argue?

4135826,Student,"       Sunday afternoon I got a call from Emilie.  Come on out and play.  No, I'm tired.  Come on!  Fuck you.  Let's go watch a movie.  Leave me alone.  Insistent as she was, I couldn't decline. I figured, I can sit at home and let my brain rot while watching another B-grade straight-to-TV movie, or I could go to the movies and pay Hollywood to send more shit to my town. Staying home was free ... but I just  had  to go out. Hadn't left the house in a bit anyway.  'What are we gonna watch?' I ask.  'The Village.'  'I'm staying home.'  Today's horror movies are crap. They all follow the same formula. People live normal, uneventful life. Something strange happens. People die. Sex and nudity. More people die. Hero confronts the evil and wins. Dependent on the director and script writer, you can add puns and one-liners at random anywhere in the movie. Don't forget your cliches.  'Bourne Supremacy,' I suggest.  Fine.  Emilie's a good driver. She's the kind of person I want to be in the car with when I  don't  have a death wish. My cousin Pat, on the other hand. Driving with him is a good way to die if you like The Who.  We arrive at the movie theater. Loew's, not Island 16. Loew's, not the more comfortable, more expensive, and adolescent-unfriendly Island 16. Loew's, where teen hormones run rampant and people are generally idiots. Not Island 16, where we pay for a good environment. Damn I should have insisted on Island 16.  The entrance to the theater is packed full of kids. Age range 12-14. They're all smoking, fondling each other, and blasting rap music. Someone talks about their slutty girlfriend. Someone talks about their abusive boyfriend. There's a whole row of them sitting on the island, wearing frilly dresses and surf wear from the Gap.  Inside on the line there's a group of guys. Age range 12-14. Mental age range 3-5. One of them is bald, and prone to fits of screaming while talking. His eyes bulge out of his face when he talks about the greatest joint he ever smoked. The other guys laugh and chug out random catch phrases.  My life is a straight-to-TV movie. Everyone I come in contact with is a bad actor, and within the course of this movie, they'll be dead. Too bad it won't be by some giant black monster from outer space that feeds off of brains to live and is sustained by radiation from the conveniently nearby nuclear power plant. Instead, their killer will be cancer. Or an STD.  At least my life is a comedy.  The line to the concession stand is not too long. In fact, it'd be a lot shorter if this fatass and her posse didn't cut in front of me and Emilie. God she was annoying. If I thought the bald crackhead on the ticket line was bad, I was wrong. He's Jesus compared to this girl. This one screamed. Loudly. And right in my face too. Of course, she wasn't directing it at me. No, it was just casual conversation with her friends. About what, I don't know. Must have been a topic that completely justified obnoxious screaming in public.  She couldn't stand still either. She's the kind of person that makes you wish you could strap her down to a chair and force-feed her Riddilin.  God they're annoying, Emilie says.  I agree.  Like I said, she couldn't stand still. First she cut us in line. Emilie and I moved to the other line. Then the girl leaves her line, and walks in front of and passes us. Then she comes back again. And again.  And again.  I got my popcorn, only to find out that the butter is now self-serve. Emilie leads me over to the butter distributor. There are two of them. Two guys were there already putting butter on their stuff. Well, one guy was at least. The other couldn't figure out that pushing the red button makes butter come out. Age range: 15-17. Mental age: 2.  He finally figured out how to do it though, with an exclamation of enlightment. 'A-ha! I've found it!' He sounded like he found out what happens at tangent 90. As I put my popcorn under the distributor, he cuts right in front of me and takes his dear sweet time with the butter. He drowns his popcorn with it. 30 seconds go by. One minute. Two minutes.  Artery age: 52 and clogged, susceptible to high blood pressure and heart attack. Or angina pectoris, whichever comes first.  Bourne Supremacy is awesome. No explanation needed, no review needed. My neighbor during the movie sucked.  Emilie and I are watching the movie. The guy and his girlfriend come and ask if the seats next to us are taken.  Nope.  He sits down.  Click.  Click.  Click.  He's chewing his gum. Real loud. And popping it.  Age range: 20-22.  Mental age: fetus.  At every plot twist in the movie, I'd hear, 'Awwwwww shit!!!! Hoo hoo!!'  Don't go to Loew's. It's a b-grade horror movie that has no happy ending. An H.P. Lovecraft story.  Outside, the kids are still loitering in front of the theater. They're still fondling each other. Still smoking. The rap music is still really loud, but now it's coming from the parking lot. A Chevy Blazer drives by, filled to the capacity inside. And outside. Two girls hung from front door windows outside the car, and the driver would speed up and then immediately stop.  And they all laughed.  Age range: 17-19.  Life expectancy: five minutes.  Adolescence is dangerous.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4132730,Non-Profit,"       Corrine had a loving and secure childhood. She was provided with the bestest of everything. Dad was a successful businessman and mum was a devoted housewife. Yes, she's the only child, so her temperament was considerably more confident than her parent's ever was. It was proof of the loving atmosphere that Corrine had cultivated in her early teenage years.  Time flies, We are into our 8th year together. Corrine's graduation from college had just taken place. Both parents had proudly attended the ceremony at Temasek JC, each taking enough photographs and video footage of her graduation to embarrass even the most devoted child. Now that she had completed college, her parents expected her to go to Australia to further her studies. She had long planned to continue her education, but when it actually came time, She was unsure. But doting dad eventually had it his way. Corrine was to be gone in Australia for the next 4 years or so.  We had promised to write to each other and call each other constantly, a time where emails ain't very popular. But, like what everyone expected, after a few weeks, the phone calls became less frequent and the letters in the mail stopped coming. Corrine had been there for almost 2 years. It was time where exams and tests are at their critical stage for me. The class work was harder than anything I ever had before. So I hunkered down and mapped a strategy to make it through the rigorous school, by keeping to myself and focusing on bunker mentality, like what all my other classmates like to put it.  Half-way thru the rigous path of school examinations, the devastating news came. It was April 15th 2000. Corrine was involved in a car accident round Sunshine Coast, Brisbane Australia. It happened before dawn on the day that Corrine was to have put herself on a flight to Tasmania where his father would have been waiting. The details from that point were sketchy as she was travelling in her brand new Ford Fiesta LX alone. The roads there were narrow, hilly dirt roads that to this day are intimidating to even the most seasoned city drivers. A blizzard hit. According to local police, the corner of the car caught Corrine, slamming her into the windshield and throwing her onto the pavement. Of all the things to happen to me in my life, none would be quite as significant as this one. Everyone was devastated. Nothing prepared me for the intense loss, anguish, and fear, let alone the parents, who have raised this only child expecting and giving only the very best to her.  Grieving is as much a part of me at that time as a foot or an eye. Many people told me of the stages of grief I would go through. There were days when I felt sadness, missing her presence, her hugs, laughter, and smiles. At that time, if you heard my laughter, it's not because I've forgotten or stopped mourning. It's because with the help of friends I am slowly beginning to see through the storm to daylight again. It is said that something like this shows you who your true friends are. Many of these people are common friends of ours, and I thank them deeply. Her parents fought hard, never losing hope of winning the battle. But I lost a soulmate, a friend, a sincere partner on April 15th, 2000. The battle wasn't lost, however, the victory will be hers in the end.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4126747,Arts,"       Does anyone else think there's always something a little creepy about the articles the NY Times does about sex? Especially  kids  and sex. I'm thinking first off of the one about New York City guys taking Viagara before going out at night from last fall, and now we have this week's  urlLink magazine cover story :  Friends, Friends With Benefits and the Benefits of the Local Mall . The article is actually pretty good, especially after you get past the first couple pages, but nevertheless big chunks of it come off as thinly veiled child porn. For those of us who attended highschool recently, not a whole lot in the article is surprising--although I will say it appears to be a whole different world out there in the suburbs, and meeting people on the Internet appears to be a lot more accepted and cool than I'd thought it was--but the piece is truly written for those who haven't attended highschool recently, our parents and their generational allies. Here's a little excerpt, about Emcho, clearly the kind of preternaturally good looking, healthy, socially casual guy that made everyone else in highschool virtually swoon with envy and self-hatred:  'Tall and lanky, with brown hair and a crush-inducing smile, Emcho said there are benefits to being highly rated on a site like facethejury. There was the college girl online who invited Emcho and a friend over to a party at her apartment. ''I was online writing my senior paper,'' Emcho said, ''and this girl instant-messages me and says, 'Hey, I saw your picture on facethejury.''' She invited Emcho over that night. They had sex in her bathroom, Emcho told me, and met up a few more times, but he says he cut it off when she started talking about wanting to date him.   Emcho and Haris said they're both partial to ''preppy suburban girls.'' As Haris put it, ''City girls are cool, but suburban girls are crazy cool!'' (Meaning, Haris explains, that suburban girls are ''easier.'') Recently, he and Emcho met up with two high-school girls. One girl offered to sneak them all into her house, where she and Emcho hooked up on the floor, while Haris and her friend used the closet.'  I'm just not sure this belongs in The New York Times. Here's one other excerpt, from an e-mail conversation a highschool girl forwarded the author:   Boy : I wish you lived like next door. . . . It would be so much easier. . . . Like I don't know about you, but I wanna [expletive].    Melissa : U always wanna [expletive].    Boy : True.    Melissa : Haha.    Boy : But that's cuz we've been talking about it and haven't done it. It's built up.    Melissa : That's bc u haven't picked me up yet silly. . . . Well I'm gonna go lay down. U know my number and where I live if things work out soon.    Boy : Hey wait. If I can do you wanna come over?    Melissa : Sure. So just call me.    Boy : Do you have condoms?    Melissa : Yes dear.     Boy : I can come get you right now if you want.    Melissa : Um gimme a sec. . . .    Boy : O.K.?? I'll come get you now if you're ready. . . .    Melissa : But I'm gonna be boring tonite . . . and I'm just telling u I'm not in the mood for nething but str8-up sex.  Okay, okay, maybe it's really  me  that's made uncomfortable and sort of envious by this stuff. This kind of life does sound like a lot of fun, after all. But still, I don't know, we've got a lot of outlets for this kind of journalism in our society--do we really need the crotchety New York Times with its crotchety audience doing articles like this? In any event, the article is worth reading, mainly for its exploration of whether teenagers actually  enjoy  any of this hooking up stuff. Having missed out on virtually everything during high school, I like to hear that all the things I missed out on just made people depressed and volatile. Now, if only I could believe it were true.             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4121521,indUnk,"       Different lesson plans require the application of different learning theories. And in most cases, a single lesson plan will probably have to follow more than one learning theory, since what can be taught in one lesson is usually more than a single skill. The principle to follow, therefore, is which learning theory can best serve the purpose of different parts of the lesson plan. For instance, when teaching a chinese lesson (like a particular text from the textbook), behaviourism will first have to be applied when teaching the new words. This is because the students are not at all familiar with the new words, and they have to be 'spoon-fed' with the meaning, pronounciation, and the way the chinese character is written. From the teacher's demonstration of which stroke of the chinese character comes first, the student will be able to know how the word should be written, without which the student is rendered helpless. Then the student can be tasked to practise how the character is written. By doing so, the student will be able to, through 'drill and practise', remember how to write the character correctly. Thus, by following the behaviourist learning theory, the stimulus here is the teacher writing the character on the board, following the correct order of the strokes. The student responds by practising it himself, and the teacher further reinforces by going through the word with the student again. This is quite the traditional classroom scenario, and the students learn by 'conditioning'. Behaviourism usually forms the basis for higher learning: in this case, chinese character is the basic knowledge needed in order to form words and sentences. The teacher can also follow the cognitivist learning theory in the same class by teaching the student the patterns the strokes of a chinese character follow (like the order is always from left to right, top to bottom, the dot usually coming last, and the like). The teacher can also point out certain 'expert' ways of remembering the order of strokes, causing the student to learn how to apply them to future situations.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I sit and force thoughts out and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I once read that if you are trying to write free flow that even when you are stumped as to what to write you should just continue to write, even if it is the same word over and over again, as eventually something will come.       But that is not what I am doing now.       I was extended a job offer this morning. Actually that is more like:   I WAS EXTENDED A JOB OFFER THIS MORNING!!!!       I am so happy... this is the beginning of so many things. I was beginning to doubt my desirability on the job market and really feel like the light at the end of the tunnel is rapidly moving further away. Right now, at this moment in time, it is hard for me to visualize a time when life will be easier and not so drama-ridden. When I will be single and I don't have to tip toe around my own home. When I will have a home. I have been searching in the wrong places, I think it is time for me to start building that home around me instead of waiting for a place to open up and take me in.

4107135,indUnk,"       It is early morning, and I’m just waking up.  My bed—it is a futon actually—is unbelievably comfortable. Three soft mattresses, piled onto each other, three satiny blankets and three really expensive pillows. All have been washed and ironed with lavender water to help me sleep.  From outside, I hear monks chanting, the sound of water hitting the pavement as shopkeepers spray off the stretch of sidewalk in front of their stores, and traffic—in constant gridlock in the downtown area outside my apartment. I couldn’t put together a more beautiful symphony of sounds to wake up to—a perfect combination of ancient, old and modern. I am in Kagoshima, Japan and I am damn proud of myself for whatever I did or didn’t do to get here. I haven’t opened my eyes yet, but when I do, I’ll see the sun rising from behind a volcanic mountain outside my window. A fluttery sensation on my face causes me to open my eyes more quickly than my normal meditative morning routine. I feel something on the end of my nose. I cross my eyes to get a better look. I see something blurry and black. And big.  What the hell is this?  I sit up. To my left, a full-length mirror is mounted on the wall. I glance at myself. Fear and panic and horror shoot through my veins. A momentary sight flashes through my head—-Kool Aid being drunk through a twisty straw...that is the speed with which the terror fills me.  By nature, I’m not the type of person who freaks out easily.  I make some exceptions. This is one of them.  Seated contently on my face—-spanning the bridge of my nose to the top of my upper lip is a giant cockroach, so hairy I’m tempted to ask about the quality of the baklava in his homeland.  I bolt from my futon, catching a strong whiff of lavender as the blankets fall to the floor. I grab the nearest magazine and brush the filthy creature from my face. It lands on the tatami, the traditional Japanese straw floor, with a dull crunchy thud. Despite the girth of this bastard, I know from experience that they can disappear into the woodwork in a matter of seconds...and when they return, they’re guaranteed to show up with 200 of their nearest and dearest.  I’m breathing and moaning in such a way that the neighbors are undoubtedly impressed with the sexual prowess of whatever man has me so worked up.  I'm willing to bet money on the conversation that is happening next door, 'Those American men, they are great in bed.'  In moments like these, logic can really escape you. I run to the far wall of the studio, which serves as the kitchen. I grab my one and only company-issued frying pan. I'll be eating out from now on.  In my head, this plan makes perfect sense. I run back to the potato-sized roach and scoop it up. I carry it out to my balcony, which, in addition to my volcano view, more directly overlooks an open-air shopping center, already packed with stylishly dressed women. I want to fling the cockroach from the pan onto the ground below, but I can see that it would only land on some poor shopper’s head.  The roach lumbers out of the Teflon area of the pan and, before I know it, he’s crawling up the handle right toward my hand. I act quickly, depositing him on the balcony railing. I’m still in a panic, the cockroach makes eye contact with me and sneers—he could easily join the band GWAR, no costume required.  “So, bitch, you put me out for a little sun...” the cockroach grumbles with malice. “Don’t you worry. I’ll be back...and you’ll remember with fondness the day I decided to crawl on your nose—-there are other places I prefer.”  I don’t know what he means by that, but it brings me to tears. I’m sobbing, I’m hyper ventilating, I’m about to scream...A cockroach has actually taken me hostage on my own balcony.  A defense instinct emerges from that deeply animalistic part of my soul. I am a warrior, defending my $600-a-month, 12-square-feet. I will not surrender. This is war. Unfortunately, I am not well versed in the language of violence.  I being to smash the cockroach into the cement ledge of my balcony with the flat bottom of the frying pan…screaming the two words (or is it three?) that only a Midwestern girl screams in battle...  “Die-jack-ass! Die-jack-ass! Die-jack-ass!” I cry with each thrash.  Finally the roach is nothing more than a chalk outline on the ledge.  I’m still breathing heavily, but my lungs are clear. I am safe. I am free. I look to the sky—-smoggy from the traffic, ashy from the volcano, smelling faintly of ramen from the shop downstairs. The world has suddenly become silent. Peaceful. I’ve been reborn. Everything is serene.  Really serene, now that you mention it.  What happened to the monks? The hoses? And traffic? Traffic never stops here.  I lower my eyes. The bustle of the mall below has ceased completely. Literally, thousands of pairs of brown, almond-shaped eyes are fixed one me. I am one of only about 20 non-Asians in this city of two million. Store owners, cab drivers, shoppers, stray cats...they’re all looking at me.  I’m reminded of Madonna as Eva Peron in the movie Evita, singing Don’t Cry for me Argentina to the crowd. I further lower my eyes.  The terror returns. I am wearing a giant pair of bright red underwear that could surely house any random sampling of three of the bodies that are staring at me now.  That is all I am wearing.  Again, as one of only a small number of foreigners in the city, possibly the only red head, and definitely the only girl to clear Japanese customs with such an aresenal of industrial sized underwear, the attentive eyes convey one thing and one thing only:  “Sarah-sensei? Is that you?”  Sadly, the answer is yes.  I am paralyzed with embarrassment. For a moment, there is silence.  Finally, one brave soul shouts up, “Sensei, what is the meaning of jackass?”           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4105030,Science,"           By:  urlLink Brian Berger Space News Staff Writer Thirty-five years after the world watched three Americans leave Earth on a mission to be the first to land on the moon, the United States is plotting a return to the lunar landscape. But while the destination is the same, the motives have changed. Then the goal was to prove to a divided world simply that it could be done and done best by a free society. Now the driving motivation is to demonstrate the technologies and hone the skills needed to venture beyond Earth’s own backyard. U.S. President George W. Bush, in dropping the exploration gauntlet during his speech at NASA headquarters in January, said the United States would return to the moon by 2020 “as a launching point for missions beyond.” Beginning no later than 2008, Bush said, the United States would begin launching robotic missions to the moon to prepare the way for extended human lunar expeditions. Bush said the moon is a good place to test the equipment and approaches needed if humans are to operate in even more challenging space environments. And the moon’s natural resources and other attributes, he said, have the potential to reduce the costs of further space exploration. Paul Spudis, a planetary scientist and a member of the presidential commission advising Bush on implementing a national space exploration strategy, said the president got it right when he called for going to the moon first. “We are going to the moon to basically take the first step beyond low Earth orbit,” Spudis said. “The key thing the president articulated in the vision is the use of lunar resources. It’s something we don’t know how to do, but something we need to be able to do if there is to be a big future for humans in space.” Doug Cooke, NASA’s deputy associate administrator for exploration systems, said the U.S. space agency’s moon agenda is still very much a work in progress. “At one end of the scale, we are talking primarily about preparation for exploration beyond the moon -- developing vehicles, spacesuits and other hardware and testing operational capabilities and techniques,” Cooke said. “At the other end of the scale, if there are outside interests that want to develop the moon and they come into play, that could drive us harder toward more permanent capabilities.” Cooke said NASA is hard at work evaluating a range of approaches to accomplishing the broad objectives spelled out by the president. NASA has put out a broad call to industry for long range lunar mission proposals and hopes to award several study contracts before the end of the year. Cooke said NASA should have a better understanding of the range of possible approaches by September. Some moon advocates, such as Spudis and Klaus Heiss, director of High Frontier, favor picking a promising plot of lunar real estate and plopping down as much infrastructure as needed to sustain a variety of human and robotic activities. Others, such as Marc Cohen, a researcher at NASA’s Ames Research Center, are advocating building a mobile habitat that can traverse the lunar surface to new destinations while waiting for its human occupants to arrive. Regardless of how NASA gets there, Cooke said the driving motivation behind going back to the moon is to prepare for increasingly challenging missions. “We’ve always thought the moon was important, at the very least, for preparing future exploration,” he said. “It has been 35 years since we did it for the first time and a lot of the experience we gained during the Apollo program has been lost.” As NASA sets out to design the vehicles, habitats and other equipment it will need for extended stays on the moon, Cook said the agency also would be keeping one eye on Mars. “We need to be mindful of the long range of exploration,” he said. “The more that we can do that is common for what we will need for Mars missions, the more efficiently we can progress down that path of exploration.” Perhaps the most tantalizing feature the moon and Mars have in common is the presence of water -- a critical element for sustaining a human presence, and not just for drinking. Cooke sees water, whether present in the surface or atmosphere of Mars or frozen in the lunar surface, as a valuable source of fuel for all manner of space vehicles. “The water ice is probably the first thing that would be investigated because it might have immediate application to various missions,” Cooke said. Those applications, Cooke said, include providing potable water, breathable oxygen and fuel for nuclear thermal or chemical rockets. The search for water could well lead to the lunar poles, a destination favored by Spudis and others in large part because of the intriguing signatures returned by the Lunar Prospector and Clementine missions of the early 1990s. “You can readily make the case that because of the presence of [potential resources] in the dark areas and near permanent sunlight offers an ideal environment to learn the things we need to learn,” Spudis said.

4101175,indUnk,"       A week from Thursday my father is undergoing 2 operations to fix his broken heart. He is growing weaker by the day and admitted to me tonight that the 2 minutes it takes him to shave in the morning leaves him feeling completely winded.  How difficult it has been to watch him grow weak before my eyes, this man who has always been as strong as an ox, as healthy as a horse -- this man who never took a sick day in his life (or even an aspirin, for that matter). How frustrating it has been to hear him insist that he knows better than the specialists, to hear him refuse treatment, to know that he is living in the land of denial -- while his heart muscle grew weaker and weaker. And how painful it has been to answer the phone to my mother's tearful cries, fearful she will be a widow if he keeps refusing the operations needed to restore him to health.  Actually, I misspoke above. I do remember one day (and one day only) that my father called in sick to work. And it was not because he was sick. It was because he went to feed our goldfish on his way out the door one morning and discovered that my sister's goldfish had jumped out of the tank and was barely alive on the dining room carpet. Mind you, he never wanted those fish. When I was 5, my sister and I begged for goldfish. He said no. So he was less than thrilled to arrive home from work one summer day to learn that my mother went and bought 2 goldfish anyway. My sister and I quickly lost interest in those fish, but not my Dad. He came to love them and I will never forget the sad look in his eyes that morning Sunshine jumped out of the tank. He spent the whole day nursing that fish and moving her back and forth in the water, trying to force air in her gills, but in the end he couldn't save her. But he did make sure she was was laid to rest in a proper burial under the buckeye tree my uncle Bert planted in our backyard when he was a boy.  I could write all night about the kindness of my father's heart and the gentleness of his soul -- about all of the stray animals he let us keep, about how he visited my grandfather every single day at the nursing home until his death, about how the first thing he did the moment he walked into the house from work was play with his 3 daughters -- but it is late and I need to be getting to bed.  Thank goodness after a month of my family begging and pleading and fighting with him, my father has listened to reason and has decided to go ahead with treatment. So I await August 26th with nervousness and hope. We have been told he will feel like a new man when the operations are completed. But I don't want a new man. I like the old one just fine and I am anxious to have him back.        ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4100686,Technology,"             Ok, this is a bit off topic, but it is scandalous and has implications for all bloggers, and also for many who don't blog.   There is an outrageous suggestion that has been floating around for a while, and seems to have resurfaced after the recent Mydoom episode - that of  urlLink paying to send email.  The spin is that charging to send email will cut down on spam, and that spammers will be turned off spamming if even 1 cent were charged per sent email. This is a really quite ridiculous assertion. Old-fashioned paper mail costs almost a dollar to send including stamp and envelope plus ink, paper etc - and our good old fashioned letter boxes are still laden with junkmail. Paying to send junkmail does not deter the sender.   If one were to examine the contents of ones oldfashionedpapermail letter box one would probably find a good deal of junk mail from supermarkets, discount warehouses and fastfood outlets. What does this suggest to me? This suggests to me that the sender/s own a chain/s of stores and certainly have the available capital to print copious amounts of glossy four colour, if tacky, brochures. The postage cost is no deterrent.    I once house shared with someone who actually LIKed reading junkmail, she would sit down with a cuppa and laugh at it all, you know, the vibrating pillows and the face massagers shaped just like - well never mind, the point is that it didn't annoy her that much. And spam doesn't annoy me that much either. In fact, some people even compose  urlLink poetry  from spam... even spammers themselves are reportedly becoming, increasingly,  urlLink poetic.   And for those who are annoyed by junkmail; spam, like paper junkmail, can be filtered from an inbox by the e-quivalent of those 'No Junkmail' stickers that some people used to stick on their boxes.    Charging for email is a moneymaking scam and more revolting in its sales pitch then spam itself.  It is another attempt to control and censor virtualspace with money, in line with recent attempts to charge for Linux and to sue for free music downloading.    I am incensed.

My Mother is still in her Dream world of where her 'Son' is perfect.  HA!!  Someone that spent time in prison, is perfect?  and innocent??  And she defended him to me!!!!!!!  Just like old times.  That's okay.  I did get to point out that for the 5 years he was in prison.  I was the one there to help her.  But I see it was all for naught, in her eyes anyway.  It's all going to be fine.  My world isn't ending over pictures, movies, dishes or even the box of food they took.  I'll replace what needs to be, and blow off the rest.  Also, since it was the only place that the boys and I could stay, you'd have been proud.  There was no drama.  I didn't say a word to start any fights.  Some have called me weak for this.  But, trust me it takes more strength to not live the drama!  The few family members I still stay in contact with, know I'm ready to break away.  The thought of leaving everything and one that you know is usually scary to most.  Not to me...Not anymore!  Have a good Day!!  God Bless and Take Care.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I'm  drawn to you  ever so fiercely... You occupy my very first thoughts in the day, and also my very last before I drift off into the night. Everytime we depart, I feel the energy, the life that you eject into me... I can feel it stir in my blood, I can feel it pump my heart... And I can't wait to see you again.

4090403,Consulting,"                 Dear Cats,  When I say to move, it means go someplace else, not to switch positions with each  other so there are still two of you in the way.  The dishes with the paw prints are yours and contain your food.  The other dishes are mine and contain my food. (Please note, placing a paw  print in the middle of my plate of food does not stake a claim for it  becoming your food dish, nor do I find that aesthetically pleasing to the slightest.)  The stairway was not designed by NASCAR and is not a racetrack.  Beating me to the bottom is not the objective.  Tripping me doesn't help  because I fall faster than you can run.  I cannot buy anything bigger  than a king-sized bed.   I am very sorry about this.  Do not think I will  continue to sleep on the couch to ensure your comfort.  Look at videos  of dogs and cats sleeping.  They can actually curl up into a ball.   It is not necessary to sleep perpendicular to each other, stretched out to  the fullest extent possible.  (I also know that sticking tails straight  out and having tongues hanging out at the other end to maximize space  used is nothing but sarcasm.)  My compact discs are not miniature Frisbees.  For the last time, there is not a secret exit from the bathroom. If by some miracle I beat you there and manage to get the door shut,  it is not necessary to claw, whine, meow, try to turn the knob, or get  your paw under the edge and try to pull the door open.   I must exit  through the same door I entered. (In addition, I have been using the  bathroom for years....feline attendance is not mandatory).  The proper order is kiss me, THEN go smell the other cats' butt.  I cannot stress this enough.  It would be such a simple change for you.  To pacify you, I have posted the following message on our front  door... Rules for Non-Pet Owners who visit and like to complain about our pets:  1.  They live here; you don't.  2.  If you don't want their hair on your clothes, stay off the furniture.  3.  I like my pet better than I like most people.  4.  To you it's an animal.  To me he and/or she is an adopted son  and/or daughter who is short, hairy, walks on all fours, and is speech-challenged.  Dogs and cats are better than kids.  They eat less, don't ask  for  money all the time, are easier to train, usually come when called,  never drive your car, don't hang out with drug-using friends, don't drink  or smoke, don't worry about buying the latest fashions, don't wear  your clothes, don't need a gazillion dollars for college, and if they  get pregnant, you can sell the results.

4077712,Accounting,   Many on the left think that we need to find out why the terrorists hate us so much and find a way to make them like us.  The only way we can make them like us is to convert in mass to their radical version of Islam and subjigate our women like they do.  I don't think even our liberal friends would find that an acceptable solution.  While having 72 virgins for being a martyr sounds like a pretty good deal for a man I don't think the 72 virgins would exactly be thrilled serving 1 man.  Most men I know have a hard time keeping 1 woman happy.  I think the Nevadans found the best way for creating wealth and enterprise in a desert as well as employing people in meaningful jobs.  Build casinos and brothels.  It is just a suggestion.  It is Friday and I have many important things to do so I will make this a short post.  I think the Arab people should brainstorm and come up with better ways of maintaining a culture other then by killing their own people.  Until they do we will come up with ways of making sure they do not kill us.  ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4075308,Student,"          see also:    urlLink  http://mostlyfiction.com/contemp/haddon.htm       I don’t do this with every book I read. It’s what you do in primary school; choose a book and take it home. Bring it back the day after and write a review. This isn’t really a review; More an account.  I’m writing about this one though, because although fictional, there is a great sense of triumph at the end of the book. Written by Mark Haddon and winner of the Whitbread Book of the Year Award (JUNE 2003), this book tells the story of fifteen year old Christopher Boone, and his struggle to find out the truth about Wellington, and his mother.  Christopher suffers from Asperser’s syndrome. He loved lists, patterns, numbers and the truth. He hated things that are brown or yellow, crowds, changes, and being touched. He believed his mother died of a heart attack, which is what he was told by his father.  He lived a happy, settled life, until he discovered his neighbour’s dog, Wellington, dead. He began a search to find the murderer of the dog, and began to write a book about it. In his book, he includes mathematical facts, and his view of other people’s minds, and the way the brain works.  This book stands out for me, because there are so many times when you feel truly sorry for him, and he’s the kind of person you’d want to meet… if he were real. His disability causes him to think like an infant; innocent and immature. Yet he is able to cope in most situations, so long as certain rules are applied. His food must not be mixed. People must not touch him. Even his own parents aren’t allowed to hug him.  I think our lives are like that sometimes. We don’t want everything to be complicated, and get annoyed when people are clingy. And yet some of us are bored so easily.  For me, Haddon’s book is a story of a child’s personality, and the way it works in his favour, to achieve the goals he sets for himself.  Thank you Mr. Haddon. Looking forward to the next.

4074829,Manufacturing,       Please note I was very drunk at time of writing…  I hate myself &amp; I want to die. Why? Because I can never imagine loving anyone as much as I hate loving my best friend’s girlfriend. I KNOW! I wish I knew how to stop it but I don’t. Fate has given me such an impossible mission. How will I ever find anyone to match  Dream Girl ?          ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4074829,Manufacturing,"       Boy, do we have a lot to catch up on. On Monday morning as I got into bed I texted Miss A & Miss B. A replied straight away. We sent a couple of messages each &amp; then she suggested a quick chat. Our quick chat lasted 2 & a half hours! It was great, we got on really well &amp; I had her really laughing! She sounded cool & a little mad! I’ve always liked a touch of madness in my women. Eventually it was decided that I should go &amp; see her for lunch. I agreed despite the fact I’d had no sleep since Sunday morning and that she live a hundred miles away in Braintree, Essex. Still I thought it would be an adventure, a tonic to spruce up my life of monotony. She described herself as having a shock of blond hair, 5’8” & wearing a rainbow coloured coat &amp; rainbow jeans. So I got cleaned up & headed off to meet  Rainbow Girl . I went cross-country as opposed to the motorway &amp; arrived about 2.30. We’d arranged to meet at Sainsburys. After about 5 minutes she appeared. I couldn’t miss her; she was a resplendent splash of colour in a sea of grey. I liked that. I walked over & said, “You must be  Rainbow Girl ”. We shared an awkward hug &amp; then went to a pub on the town square. It was a nice pub & we chatted for ages, it went really well. Then we had to go &amp; pick up her car from a garage, get KFC (which I resisted) for her eldest & go to her house. We then returned to the pub on foot. By this time it was apparent that I wouldn’t be going to see Easyworld after all. She said I should have a proper drink as I’d been on cokes since I had a pint when I arrived. I explained how I couldn’t because I had to drive home. “Sleep on my sofa” – “Ok, let’s drink!” I didn’t have to be in Crapsville to see The Boy till 3 the next day so why not? As the night drew on we laughed, we flirted, we argued about Britney’s hotness &amp; we simply had lots of fun. I really liked this slightly mad woman & I fancied her too. I got the feeling this may have been mutual. We stumbled back to hers after chucking out time &amp; after a coffee she went to bed & I slept on the sofa. I was very, very tired &amp; went off almost instantaneously. She woke me at 6am! The kids would be up in a minute & she’d rather I was up. Fair enough. I liked  Rainbow Girl ’s kids even though I only spent a couple of hours around them. I’ve since been told that they liked me too, which is nice.  Rainbow Girl  left to take them to school, when she returned she said she wanted to lie down on her bed &amp; that I should join her. So we laid there for a couple of hours, chatting & laughing. The whole time I really wanted to kiss her but like the fool that I am struggled to gain the courage to make that first move. With the clock ticking towards my departure time I finally leant in &amp; gave her a kiss. And it was one hell of a kiss, soft, slow & lingering to which she responded fully. All the while my fingers were gently stroking her neck or in the back of her hair. It was a beautiful first kiss, a kiss of such quality I shall forever be proud of it. This was not all good though.  Rainbow Girl  fixed her glare on me &amp; said, “You can’t kiss a woman like  that  & then just go!” She was right, I didn’t want to go &amp; she didn’t want me to. So I phoned  Temper Tantrum  & asked her if she could pick  The Boy  up from school &amp; I’d arrive a couple of hours later. “No, I’ve made plans now” was her curt reply.  Rainbow Girl  being a single mum insisted that I shouldn’t let  The Boy  down. So I had to leave. It was desperately obvious that if I wasn’t going we’d be having sex. So we kissed goodbye & I set off for Crapsville. I was livid, absolutely fucking gutted. I’d got about 10 miles when I got a text from  Rainbow Girl  saying I’d left her confused &amp; frustrated but she wasn’t hungry anymore. When another came a minute later saying “ well not for food anyway!” I should’ve done a handbrake turn there & then. Instead I ploughed on: M11, M25, M1 all at 90mph wearing a face like thunder. I would’ve cheerfully strangled anyone who got in my way during those 2 hours. I got to Crapsville at quarter past 3 &amp; spent the next few hours with  The Boy  watching Return of the Jedi & having several lightsaber duels- all of which I had to lose!I didn’t resent  The Boy  one iota but I was full of contempt for  Temper Tantrum . However, there was no way I was going to allow her the glee of knowing she had cost me my first shag for 10 long fucking months! I went round to see  Funny Dance  for a couple of hours before work &amp; told him the tale, much to his friendly amusement. Then at work I spent another couple of hours on the phone to  Rainbow Girl . Again it was great. We talked a lot about the kiss I “should have never have given”. She told me I’d left her frustrated, throbbing & soaking wet. That’s never a bad thing to hear is it? Come 6.30 Wednesday morning when I got home I was absolutely knackered having only had 6 hours sleep since Sunday morning. I slept like the proverbial log. Yesterday passed without incident though throughout I’ve been jolly, bouncy &amp; refreshed. I shall call  Rainbow Girl  again tonight, somehow we have to find a mutually agreeable time for a second visit because as we are both very aware, we have unfinished business.

4071623,indUnk,"               My First Juiced-Up Experience!  So last night I went and got “juiced up”. I have to say this is my first time and I found that I was alittle lost.  I mean good grief they have nicknames for the Starbucks staff. As I was sitting back and listening to everyone talk I decided that maybe I should share what I learned last night, that way you won’t be so lost when you go and get “juiced up”.  Since I’m real good with list I thought a top 10 list would be appropriate. Remember this is all stuff that I learned last night while sitting at Starbucks for an hour and half with these people.   10. There’s a girl staff and guy staff. Last night we had the girl staff plus one guy. 9.   There seems to be two favorite Starbucks employees among the group. First there’s Starbucks Sarah and then there’s Smokie Smokerson. I had the pleasure of seeing both girls last night. 8. Smokie Smokerson seemed nice and looks pretty normal. She got the nickname because every time she has a break she’s always looking for an ash tray. I was also told she has a boyfriend that picks her up from work and he wears a white hate…they like to call him White Hat Guy. Grant described the hat as a beret type hat, but not! (whatever that means) 7. Starbucks Sarah is the gothic looking girl. She actually talked to us while she was taking down the umbrellas and seemed pretty nice. I think she also gave Ken a drink on the house. We tried to get Ken to go flirt with her but he wouldn’t. 6. Stalkers… as I sat there last night I realized that I was with a bunch of stalkers. They all know so much about the people that regularly visit Starbucks and they really don’t talk to them….I was getting alittle worried and creeped out at the same time. 6. Grant’s Girl. She did NOT show up to Starbucks last night!  If you don’t know Grant thinks this girl that wears glasses and a sweater is kinda cute. I do want to add that Grant is NOT stalking the girl….Rosey is. Rosey knows everything about her…well ok not everything, but she sure knows alot for never talking to her. 5. This group goes to Starbucks way too much! When Grant’s order was ready they said “Grant your orders ready.”  That was the big time for this group! 4. Starbucks gives free water. I know that’s not interesting but hey it’s good info to know! 3. Grant’s Girl again. I just would like to add that this group knows what time she normally visits Starbucks. I told you it’s creepy. Oh it’s 10:30pm if you’re wondering! 2. Slap bracelets are back in style. Remember those? Yeah they’re back so go get one! 1. When Grant was a kid he liked to dress up like Michael Jackson! I’m serious!!!!!!! He had the red leather jacket and everything….he even had the glove! Are you laughing as hard as I am now?  So over all the night was a lot of fun. I would rate the night as 8 or 9, only because it took me a few minutes to figure everything out. I highly recommend you go and get “juiced up”.  ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4066576,Student,"             Today, I worked from 11:00am to 6:00pm. Jay was waiting for me in Second Cup during I was working at St. Lawrence Market.  I ran into the coffee shop after work with lots of fruits and vegitables for free.  Those were from my work. My co-worker gave me some of fruits and vegitables whenever I work over there. I really appreciate her help and taking care about me. If I were her, I could not do like her. I should learn how to treat someone like her.  I met Jay at the coffee shop near streetcar stop in Jarvis street.   We were very hungry so, we took a streetcar for having dinner in a Korea Town. Our menu was 'Gam-Ja Tang' which is korean soup. It was so delicious. We got home around 8:30pm. I already took a shower. Therefore, I feel so fresh and I am ready to sleep.   Now, It's 9:30pm.   My roommate, Jay told me that she prepared some soup and side dishes for tomorrow morning meal for me while I was taking a shower in a bath. I know she wanted to take a shower, too. But, She made some food for me because I have to wake up early tomorrow. My work will be from 7:00am to 6:00pm.  I feel so sorry to her and thank her a lot. And She is waiting right now for using internet after me. Everything is after me for her. How can I be her best friend? Maybe, I will never be her friend just as a younger sister. And She usually take care of me. Thank you Jay.   I don't know how to say for this great support. Just thank that is what I can say to her right now.  Wow... It's 10:07pm. I should go to bed now. I have to wake up at 5:00am tomorrow.  She is eating some korean snack which we bought in Christie after dinner. She quite enjoy that. I am so happy to see that. Whenever she eat something, It looks so cute and happiness in her face. Especially, when she have lots of whipping cream on her coffee. KKKK...            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4055095,Government,"            Here's the maiden voyage of my blog.  I've heard of blogs for awhile now, but really haven't looked too much into what they were.  Of course, I'm always interested in reading other people's random thoughts.  So why shouldn't I share all the mundane crap that goes on in my life as well?       Work went well today.  Lots to do and not enough time to do it in.  We have 2 people out of the office, so we're short handed.  But we're not hurting.  I work in the County Clerk's Office and we're currently looking at changing the way we archive records.  For decades, we've used microfilm.  That's worked just fine except that our microfilm camera is as old as the hills and we are in desperate need of a new system.  So rather than buy a new microfilm camera, we're going to start living in the 21st century and switch to 'imaging'.  We'll be scanning the documents that are filed with us and storing them as digital images on the computer.  I am so excited because I'm a total computer nerd and this is right up my alley.       I've been experimenting with a scanning system for the past week and although it's simplistic in comparison to other systems that are out there, I am very impressed with the image quality and potential for what we can do with these scanned images.  Right now, if you come into my office and ask for a copy of a document, we have to make a copy from microfilm and it may not look that great because the filmer might not have checked it that well.  Or the microfilm may show some aging.  But digital images will never degrade!  Plus I can make you a copy of a document without getting my backside up out of my chair!  :)  Am I lazy?       Another benefit from going to digital imaging is the storage room we can reclaim.  Right now, our office is overrun with huge books from the late 1800's and early 1900's.  Then we have many cabinets full of microfilm.  If we can convert all that (eventually) to digital images, we'd have more room for the new cases that are filed with us.       Upon coming home from a nice, busy day at the office, I was greeted by an almost paved road.  The County is working to have our road repaved and buddy, it needed it!  It's had so many potholes for years.  They'd usually just come out and patch them up.  And we all know what happens to a patch job on a road.  It lasts what, two months tops?  At any rate, we're finally getting a brand new re-surfaced road.  Yay!       I also received a message that a friend of mine had her appendix removed today.  Apparently she began hurting yesterday (on her birthday of all days).  She went to a hospital in a city that I know nothing about.  I'd like to go see her, but I'm afraid I'll get lost.  She's supposed to get out tomorrow night, so I don't feel so bad about not seeing her.  I'll check with her when she gets back.  Poor girl.  She's had more bad luck with health.  First she was diagnosed with Crone's Disease, then just recently got over a bout with Pneumonia and then some bronchial problem and now she's gotta deal with this.  Good grief!  I'd certainly understand if she were to get depressed.  I know I would be.  But she still keeps going!  I'm glad she has the will power to keep going.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4053972,indUnk,"            Hey people, once again updating my blogger. This weekend I went over my dad's house, which was pretty cool. Friday night I had practice, and after that we went to applebee's(After an uber-fast shower, of course). Then my sister complained that she was 'tired' in the restaurant, so we ordered food and then went home to eat. Then I went to bed, and woke up to the great day of saturday! Oh boy! Well, we met up with my uncle, went to breakfast, and then went to some generic sports store in derry to get some of my football equipment. Then it was off to my grandfather's house, to fix the foundation under his house because it's rotting out. We were there until about 6:30, and then we left to get a pizza and settle down at home for the night. We watched 'Starsky and Hutch' which was an alright movie. Then today I went to church, then went to the mall to get  more  football stuff that I didn't get the day before. I saw Nick, Steph, and Jess at the mall, which was cool. After that we went to my grandfather's house  again,  to help him load something into his truck. After that (wow alot of 'after that's and then's) we got dropped off at home, and here I am now! Ooh tomorrow we get to wear pads to practice.... I'm feeling evil. Oh well, that's enough for now, i'll post tomorrow. Comment and make it positive!

4050670,indUnk,"       My goodness, how I love Kuntree.  Piglet was up around midnight sometime then at 2.  And she didn't go back to sleep.  She wouldn't nurse, wouldn't burp, was clean and dry and cuddled between Mom and Dad in bed.  She would not sleep.  At 4 Kuntree got up with her.  I heard her crying and told him to bring her back...he said 'I  told  you I'd take care of her now you go to sleep!'  Somehow he got her to go to sleep for a little while (on the floor next to Daddy...what's it with my girls?).  At a little after 7 he brought her in and told me that she was ready to eat.  After nursing her I ate cold pizza from last night (yum) and sat here yawning.  Piglet was asleep in her swing.  Kuntree told me to go to bed.  I went to get her out of the swing and was told, again, 'I  told  you to go to bed.'  Yes sir.  I heard Tater about 10 so I got up.  I miss her like crazy when she's gone.  Now Kuntree's telling me to go on to bed and he'll put Tater down for a nap.  Maybe this afternoon...          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4049904,Consulting,"             In Microsoft® Windows® 2000 Server, system state data comprises the registry, COM+ Class Registration database, system startup files, and the Certificate Services database. Restoring the Registry - If you use Backup to restore lost data to the registry, all system state data is replaced.  The registry is not contained within the SYSVOL directory, so this would not help repair the registry.  When you back up the system state data, a copy of your registry files is also saved in the folder %SystemRoot%\Repair\Regback. If your registry files become corrupted or are accidentally erased, you can use these files to repair the registry without performing a full restore of the system state data. This method of repairing the registry is only recommended for advanced users.   If there is an error in your registry and your computer ceases to function properly, you can restore the registry to its state when you last successfully started your computer. To do this, select Last Known Good Configuration. However, since you have already started the computer, and successfully logged on, the last known good configuration would be the configuration you are now running.  When you run Setup.exe with the /DisasterRecovery option, Exchange 2000 restores executable files and system settings without disturbing the existing Active Directory information for the system, such as mailbox and public stores. Setup in disaster recovery mode installs Exchange 2000 without resetting the server’s configuration to defaults, but instead, leaves the server in its last configuration. Setup /DisasterRecovery will reconfigure the local server, including program files, registry settings, and database paths.  DomainPrep is run once per domain to create the public folder proxy container and set permissions within the domain. You do not need to run DomainPrep in a domain until you are ready to install Exchange 2000. DomainPrep must be run in all domains where you install Exchange 2000 and in all domains that contain recipient objects, such as mailboxes or distribution lists.  If you install Exchange 2000 without specifying /DisasterRecovery then existing Active Directory information for the system, such as mailbox and public stores will be lost. These answers are therefore not the best solutions.  You are required to prevent unauthorized users from view email messages, usernames and password. You can achieve by encrypting email messages, usernames and passwords. By using a secure web server all HTTP traffic will be encrypted. In order to use a secure web server you need to request and install a certificate. By using a secure channel all IMAP traffic will be encrypted. In order to use a secure channel you need to request and install a certificate.  If Basic Authentication is enabled (the default), clients are not forced to encrypt the user name or password. If an intruder can watch the communication between a client and the server, this person can get access to users' account information. It is advisable to disable the Basic Authentication method, but alternatively, you may enforce the encryption of the communication channel. The option to disable Basic Authentication would prevent the username and password from being sent in plain text, but would not stop email messages being intercepted and read, and so is not the best solution   You can use MIME Base64 encoding (which replaced the legacy Unix-to-Unix encoding method [UUENCODE]) and plain text, to encode data using Internet standard transfer formats. Encoding is used to place data into a stream of bits for external storage or transmission, not to protect and prevent access to the contents.  All access to mailbox and public folder resources is validated, although you have the option to allow anonymous access to public folders. If the users used Anonymous (The Anonymous account corresponds to the Anonymous Logon system account of Windows 2000) then they would not be able to access their own mailboxes. Since all users are accessing mailboxes they will be authenticated using their own logon information.  By creating a storage group for each database on servers 1 and 2 you would be able to restore each database simultaneously. Circular logging is disabled by default, so therefore you would be able to restore the databases on server 1 and server 2 to the state that existed 1 minute prior to the failure would require the presence of transaction logs. By creating a storage group for all databases on server 3 you would be able to restore each database simultaneously.  Circular logging basically means automatically deleting transaction log files and their entries. Circular logging prevents duplicate consumption of disk space, but it is not compatible with fault-tolerant configurations and several online backup types, which rely on the existence of transaction logs. In order to restore the databases on server 1 and server 2 to the state that existed 1 minute prior to the failure would require the presence of transaction logs.  All databases within a storage group share the same set of log files, so transaction logs are deleted only after all databases have been backed up. This is one reason you should configure backup operations for entire storage groups. By creating a storage group for each database on server 3 you would not be able to restore each database simultaneously.  Circular logging basically means automatically deleting transaction log files and their entries. Circular logging prevents duplicate consumption of disk space, but it is not compatible with fault-tolerant configurations and several online backup types, which rely on the existence of transaction logs. Although the question does not state that up-to-the-minute recovery should be possible it is not recommended that you enable circular logging for storage groups that hold business-relevant data. With full-text indexing, every word in a store is indexed, making faster search and retrieval possible without requiring special mail clients. This is not required and unnecessary.  Backups of system state information, which covers Active Directory, Registry, IIS metabase, and data from other system components, such as Certificate Services. Therefore you need to restore the system state data to restore the metabase to a point prior to Stefan's changes.  The Inetpub directory is the root directory housing the web root directory, scripts, samples, nntpfile and other folders that contain data. Configuration however is stored in the IIS metabase, which resides on the local hard disk of each IIS server in a file named METABASE.BIN, which is located in the \Winnt\System32\Inetsrv directory, by default. Replacing the contents of Inetpub would therefore not help correct changes made.  Reinstalling IIS will not correct the changes that have been made. The result of a reinstall will either be to replace the metabase contents with a default copy or retain the current incorrect settings.  Databases restored to a different server require new database GUIDs. You need to select the 'This Database Can Be Overwritten By A Restore' check box for all those databases that you intend to recover. This causes the Information Store to patch the databases and assign new database GUIDs.  ISINTEG -patch is not a valid switch. Valid switches include -s (ServerName), -fix (check and fix), -verbose (report verbosely), -l (log file name), -t (reference database location), -test (testname,...) & -dump (verbose dump of store data).  Online backups are aware of the Exchange Server databases and their transaction log files. They guarantee that entire stores are covered even if only transaction log files are written to tape. The restore process will restore any backups including transaction logs that are required. New transactions will be written to wherever the new transaction log files reside. Their location is not relevant to the restore process.  Circular logging basically means automatically deleting transaction log files and their entries. However the restore process will restore any backups including transaction logs that are required. Future transaction logs will be deleted automatically, but this should not affect previous backup and restore operations.  When performing backup and restore, you receive an Event ID 1018, 1019, or 1022: Database is damaged error message. The error seen was 1010ESE reporting hard faults, which can be equated to hardware faults. This means that online backup cannot complete because the database is damaged. Check the hardware for errors and complete a restore of this database as soon as possible. When restoring databases and transaction log files, specify a working directory for the Backup utility. It is important to specify a folder different from the production log file location. During hard recovery, older logs are applied from the temporary directory to the databases before the more recent logs from the production location are replayed. This allows you to recover even those items that have not been included in the backup. Therefore you should ensure that the existing transaction logs are not overwritten.  If all your recent backups cannot be used, you will have to fix corruption using ESEUTIL.EXE with the /p switch. After running ESEUTIL.EXE, you must check the databases at the Information Store level using ISINTEG.EXE. Since current backups are available, you should use these. This is not the optimal solution   You can use ESEUTIL/g to check database integrity. This is a read-only utility that does not make changes to the database  Removing the existing transaction logs will prevent you from recovering those items that have not been included in the backup.  If you discover a corrupted database, you may attempt to fix the problem. If all your recent backups cannot be used, you will have to fix corruption using ESEUTIL.EXE with the /p switch. It is important to note that the repair is performed at the level of the ESE, which is below the Information Store. While corrupted pages are fixed and purged, the database is returned to a consistent state, but this does not mean that it still contains all the data that the Information Store needs to operate accurately. Hence, after running ESEUTIL.EXE, you must check the databases at the Information Store level using ISINTEG.EXE. The Information Store Integrity utility (ISINTEG) can find and eliminate database errors and problems in high-level data structures. To fix problems, you must specify the -fix option at the command line.   In a soft recovery, a database starts normally and the storage group is initialized. If the database is inconsistent — that is, it was not shut down properly — the ESE replays transactions from the checkpoint through to the log file, Edb.log. When it encounters a lost database, it reports that the databases are no longer consistent and ceases the soft recovery. To get around this problem, the administrator can run ESEUTIL/R. R stands for soft recovery and causes the server to resume the soft recovery. However, since the transaction log files were damaged not the database files this option would not help. The soft recovery process would have run though as soon as the server was started after the power failure, but this has not helped, (so causing the process to rerun would still not help).  If you experience Information Store problems, you can use ESEUTIL.EXE with the /g switch to verify database integrity. If all your recent backups cannot be used, you will have to fix corruption using ESEUTIL.EXE with the /p switch.  ISINTEG -patch is not a valid switch. Valid switches include -s (ServerName), -fix (check and fix), -verbose (report verbosely), -l (log file name), -t (reference database location), -test (testname,...) &amp; -dump (verbose dump of store data).  Following a successful restore of databases to a recovery server outside the production forest, you need to reconnect the mailboxes that you are interested in to newly created user accounts. In the scenario presented the Exchange Server exists undamaged. However, you would need to create new user accounts in active directory with which you could link mailboxes from the Exchange database files. For numerous mailboxes, on the other hand, use the Mailbox Reconnect utility to generate an .ldf import file, and then use LDIFDE to create the required user accounts in the recovery forest. Next, grant your account Receive As and Send As permissions on the production and recovery stores to open all mailboxes using your account, and then use the Exchange Mailbox Merge Wizard to play back the data from the recovery server to the production systems.  When you run Setup.exe with the /DisasterRecovery option, Exchange 2000 restores executable files and system settings without disturbing the existing Active Directory information for the system. Since server 1, (the only domain controller) fails and a new forest has been created, no Active Directory information for the Exchange 2000 system currently exists.   Even by reinstalling Exchange 2000 and configuring the installation to use the existing database files, the user accounts will not exist - since this information is stored within Active Directory and a new forest has been created.   By joining Exchange 2000 to the new domain user accounts will not exist - since this information is stored within Active Directory and a new forest has been created.   The desired result of a disaster recovery is a 1:1 copy of the original server. Consequently, the hardware configuration of the recovery server should match the configuration of the original machine. Reinstall the operating system. Use the same version of Windows 2000 Server that was previously installed, specify the original system drives, directories, and the old server name. It is vital that you install the same Windows 2000 components that were previously installed. The only difference is that the reinstalled server is a member of a workgroup instead of the production domain. Databases restored to a different server require new database GUIDs. You need to select the 'This Database Can Be Overwritten By A Restore' check box for all those databases that you intend to recover. This causes the Information Store to patch the databases and assign new database GUIDs.  If you want to perform database recovery operations while the original production server is available and users are connected to their mailboxes, you must install Exchange 2000 Server in a different forest.  When you run Setup.exe with the /DisasterRecovery option, Exchange 2000 restores executable files and system settings without disturbing the existing Active Directory information for the system, such as mailbox and public stores. In a new forest (as in the question) no Active Directory information for the system exists, so this answer is not applicable. ISINTEG -patch is not a valid switch. Valid switches include -s (ServerName), -fix (check and fix), -verbose (report verbosely), -l (log file name), -t (reference database location), -test (testname,...) &amp; -dump (verbose dump of store data).

I went to bed at around 5:00 in the morning, when my mom was supposed to wake me up at six. So I ended up having an hour of sleep. o_O But then I went to sleep again, after about an hour, and I woke up at 10:00. So about six hours of sleep in all. And this happens everyday.

I have my own bed and she had an inflatable mattress.&nbsp; Well she has a cat and that cat is so annoying.&nbsp; It claws everything and it gets in the way and it stinks up both rooms.&nbsp; There is the living room which is connected to the kitchen which is connected to the dining room.&nbsp; Then there is the bedroom which is connected to the bathroom.&nbsp; So its a pretty small place that she can stink up.&nbsp; Well that cat popped the inflatable bed, and since the baby who is almost two years old doesnt sleep in her own bed yet, I decided I would be a good friend and let her an the baby sleep on my bed....big mistake.&nbsp; I had to choose from sleeping on the bed or on the futong or whatever thing that she has in the livingroom that is broken so it doesn't even become a bed anymore.&nbsp; It just sits there like a cough.&nbsp; Well I sleep there, only problem is she is seeing two guys and when they come over at night they wake me up because they knock at the door and she gets it but they come in right where I am sleeping.&nbsp; And then when they leave, they wake me up again and i work from 9-5 m-f and have been getting up really early to go get an apointment with a coulselor for school.&nbsp; So I have been really exhausted for a long time now.&nbsp; So just to&nbsp;summarize, I sleep on the couch and get woken up all the time and she sleeps on my bed all confy and everything.&nbsp; So I'm really stupid or really nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My parents bribed me on telling me that if I move back they will help me pay for school, which is really good because I wanted to get out of there already so I get my bed back.&nbsp; And I get to live with no drama in my life because that girl is all drama.&nbsp; She bitches abut everything and everyone.&nbsp; I am so happy I'm going back home.&nbsp; I miss my parents and I stay friends with her because I'm moving out of there not because of her but because I want to go back to school and my parents will help me but only if I move back with them.&nbsp; I have only been out of my house for about two months if not less.&nbsp; So we will see how school goes now....  &nbsp;          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4013711,Education,"           'I would have preferred if we had given diplomacy a greater opportunity, but I think it was the right decision to disarm Saddam Hussein, and when the President made the decision, I supported him, and I support the fact that we did disarm him.'  -John Kerry on ABC News  Well JK, this is really interesting.  You looked at the intelligence, and made the same inference that the President did?  Anyone who says that Bush 'lied' or 'misled' this country for personal gain is simply exaggerating for political gain.  The last time a President did not act (not only Clinton, but Bush too) three thousand people died catastrophically.  If there is a risk to the U.S., and this was confirmed by MI6, Russians, and the U.N.; to not act would be criminal.  I agree that the war was unjustified, and that there may have been other tertiary motives.  However, to say that President Bush intentionally fought this war for oil or some conspiracy theory is out there.  Not one naysayer has been able to prove that the President had done this for personal gain.  See Bob Woodward's book; he doesn't take the president off the hook, but he does say that the intel was on the side of attacking.  Bob is non-partisan, and he did take down Nixon, so he has no problem taking on the republicans.  If anyone tells me that my wife is safer going to work, or that my young cousins are safer going to school because we obliterated a brutal regime, I would say good.  In the world of post 9/11, there is NO margin for error.  The primary job of the President is to protect the country.  When the 9/11 commission shows verivied intel that al-Zarqawi (the murderer who enjoys decapitation) was getting free services from Sadaam, that is a red flag.  When the Iraqi government stonewalls the U.N. and U.S. inspectors sent to investigate WMD's. that is a flag too.  But most of all, when Hans Blix left the country prematurely due to lack of cooperation, do we as a world nation just say - ok, you may carry on how you like?  The precedent has been set, America does what it says, and Hussein's flagrant violations of UN  resolutions and his own peace accord should have warranted immediate action.  Coming soon - my position on France!  Looking forward to commentary on this one, the bait has been set!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3994437,Arts,"        Taking rejection well....     Okay, the headshots were a complete wash. Out of 40 photos, only this one was even remotely worthy of being seen in public, and that was after two hours of digital touch up to tone down the black sludge around my eyes. It will work for now, but I will definitely have to get them done again.   However my voiceover demo was quite a success. I have six well produced commercial spots that I feel highlight my voice quite nicely. Now I need to figure out how I will have CD copies made. I have a couple of options, and it just comes down to cost, really. I could send the master to a CD-duplicating lab and have them run off copies. They would create labels and case covers and it would look polished and professional. Expensive, though, and there's a minimum run of at least 100 copies. If I make any changes to my demo or to my information (like get an agent or something) then I'd have to go through the whole thing again every time.  I could burn copies myself on my Mac and create labels with a CD-Stomper. That would be the most cost-effective way to do it, and I could burn only as many copies as I would need for any given mailing. If I wanted to make changes or rearrange the content, it's easy and there would not be any wasted CD's lying around. But that would also be quite time-consuming as I can only burn one copy at a time, then print the label, stick it to the CD... on the other hand, it also frees me up to try different types of media, such as the little mini-CDs or the new business-card shaped CD's.  I think I'll try a test-run and burn a few on my Mac. then I can take a day and drive all over LA and drop them off at selected agencies and see if I get a bite. I can save a few to mail off in case there's a voiceover casting call somewhere, too, and see if I can drum up some jobs on my own. If I can manage to land a couple of jobs, then that will give me some more content for my demo, as well as put some money in my pocket.  I've actually been quite industrious lately. I created an acting resume and posted it on the Backstage.com's resume section. There's a zillion of them in there, and unless someone is specifically looking for a 30-40 year old redhead with green eyes that sings alto, chances are it probably won't get a lot of hits. But it's there, and I can send a link to anyone via email, and that means if there's an online casting notice, I'll pop off a note and a link and see what happens. If you'd like to take a look at it, you can click on the link at the bottom of this page. Let me know what you think. Be brutally honest. I can take it.  On the other job front, things are looking pretty grim. I was actually turned down for a store manager position at Starbucks. Here's what they said, 'Thank you for taking the time to submit your profile for the store manager - San Fernando Valley position. We have carefully evaluated your profile, and while your qualifications are impressive, regrettably they do not meet our present need for the store manager - San Fernando Valley position.'  Is that joke or what?? I spent eight years managing the entire grip and lighting department at a motion picture studio, and they don't think I can 'meet the present need' for a Starbucks??!! Can someone tell me what the heck that's all about? I'm so insulted, I could spit. If any of you work at the Starbucks corporation, please, by all means, tell me why someone who's intelligent, educated, and experienced isn't suitable for managing a Starbucks retail location. Or better yet, give me a freaking job at the corporate level so I can find out for myself.  Well, kids, it's off to CompUSA to pick up some blank CD's and a label stomper.

I know it's not completely my fault for missing dinner tonight, but it still doesn't let me go.  I think me getting sick has to do with all this stress and traveling that I've been doing for work.  Hopefully with the ending of the programs that I've been working on and the ending of all this travelling that I've been doing, that I'll get better and put all of these illnesses behind me.  I feel really bad about everything with Mandy...  It seems that I've been sick for the brunt of the time that we've been together.  What's weird is that she has hardly been sick and I'm the sick one continuously.  And what's really weird is that before a few months ago, I hadn't been sick in years before!  But, again, I think this has to do mostly with the fact that work is taking a toll on me and my lifestyle.  I'm continuously working 50+ hour weeks and sometimes a 60+ hour week, especially when I'm traveling.  I hope it all goes away real soon with the ending of these programs this week.  If I'm lucky.  Let's hope I get better soon.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3989287,Tourism,"       Another highly absorbing and thought provoking exhibition opened on Wednesday in Hamilton;  Two talented women joined forces for their exhibition opening at the New Media Show in Hamilton, New Zealand this week.    The first was Maree Mills (lecturer in video production and experimental video at University of Waikato). Her installation  'Hau: breath/wind'  explores  'communication of ethereal and/or cosmological concepts inherent in the Maori world view, from a female perspective.'    Maree believes video installation is a  'multi-layered form of communication that can make some headway towards articulating aspects of tikanga Maori for the twenty first century.  Margaret Orbell in her book 'The Natural World of the Maori' says that 'Human breath was experienced as the counterpart of the breath of the world, which was felt to possess a kind of life.'   The harnessing of the elements in order to carry messages or the rising of winds to augur a spiritual presence is a concept notable in many indigenous cultures. In this work, a female deity is called forth by the elements, from progeny of the deceased, in order to assist the journey of the soul.' (Maree Mills, 2004)   I found  'Hau' , with it's connetations to the divine, and the subtle, yet highly seducive placement of the video footage, mesmerising and intriguing.  I feel this installation pulls you into the very chasm of creation and enables the viewer a tantalizing glipse of the circle of life.   The second was Margi Moore (teacher at the Waikato Institute of Technology). Her film  'Rory 2004'   Abby plays The Sims for 45 minutes (Video 22 minute loop)  'This video work is deliberately antithetical to most video games.  Unlike the games, is quiet, repeptitive, lacking in colour and has little or no activity.  Sound is excluded, offering little clue as to what is occuring.  This is the face of video games that parents rarely see, as we are normally removed from the activity.  The game is an occupier of time, a tool for entertainment, or at worst, a babysitter.  As the author of this work, I too am absent.  I set up the camera and left the scene so my presence did not impact on the experience.  Rory is the identity Abby gives herself as a character in the games.  As a viewer you are invited to contemplate her face and the subtle responses Abby has to the game she is playing.' (Margi Moore, 2004)   My reaction to  'Rory April 2004'  was that I found it both fascinating and disturbing; Fascinating because you cannot seem to take your eyes away from the obviously rapped attention on this girls face.  Disturbing because it is not YOU the girls is fascinated with, but something you cannot SEE; in the fact that you watch the face of a young woman who shows absolutely no cultural or social recognition of another being present throughout the whole video.  It is almost as if you are within the computer and a tiny part of her game without her recognition at all.  A strong message to us all and perhaps a glimpse of the very near future?  Both pieces are wonderfully and terribly powerful. A great sinergy of different world views and messages, joining forces to bring to us the power and talent of these amazing women.   Strong talent, bold statements, amazing creative energies!   If you are anywhere in Hamilton I definitely recommend a visit:  New Media Show 10-14 August 2004 (Maree and Margi)     Platform 01 Victoria Street Hamilton New Zealand     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3987552,indUnk,"       Friday was the biggest waste of a day.  Where to start?  I guess in the beggining:  Woke up way to early.  And why? To go to school for 6 hours.  The mentor training was the gayest thing ever.  I have never done so much pointless 'Team Building' in my life.  I have every school year when you have to meet your class mates and all that other stupid 'Meeting you new friend' stuff.  When that was over, of course it would be raining.  I don't hate rain (even if i should) BUT I hate when it is bright and sunny and raining. When it rains, it should be dark.  After that I called 3 of my people; talked to one of them, talked to one parent, and talked to some guy that didn't know when he would be back.  But at least I tried.  Only 3 more calls to make.  Friday was the first day I actually wish I add been at work.  The rest of the day just kinda sucked.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3985159,indUnk,"                 Went to Ann Arbor Yesterday, too apply once more to subsized housing so I can move to Ann Arbor affordably. I was accepted onto the list, thankfully. But the list is probably 3 years long or more wait. I am going to start indivually apply to 236 code apartment complexs down in that area. I steamed cleaned the to carpet's today and detrimned to bust my ass to get the wallpaper chores here conpleted, wall's primed, and painted.....then I can work on doing inprovements to the porch and front bedrood/bathroom area..all of which will increase the ability to sell my home at a better price/and or faster( crosses finger's) I just wish it was all over with already, the waiting, the not knowing is frustrating. I am tired of just exsisting..I need to start creating a life, a future for me and my kid's..None of which of that seem's to be happenign here..which moving  here was supposed to be the sole purpose. It didn't happen. Ann Arbor over all will help serve many function's for self indendence. The access to the mass public transit system, the amenditie's available, the doctor's , program's etc. Almost sound's as if I'm trying to convience myself it's worth moving. It is, it is just hard to mentally change my mind to owning, though just a moblie home..to renting.  It will do me some good. And I am hoping mostly it will do my children some good also.   On thr Kat front, we have been' talking' not because Kat was too , how do i put it? encouraged? anyways....to talk to me about what transpired, but I persisted. If anything I needed to talk about it. I learned a few thing's about myself...not much more I'll admit about her. Kat confuse's me that is for sure. Not all confusion is a bad thing..least it is making me learn some realitie's about myself, that I've blinded myself to over the year's.  We  get so set in our 'ways' and get blind to the surrounding's , including people we take for granted in them ...I am learning I am no acception to this injustice. Kat is still'stand offish' towards me and whats has transpired between us, I am also......I just seem to process thing's to a resolution faster then she does apparently. It will help  me( if I allow it to) learn patience with other's.       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There's probably going to be a farily odd mix of people, which is always good, it makes life interesting.  I'm really looking forward to taking in the inspiration of the beach and nature.  I love the city but the little things like being able to see the stars at night, and the sunsetting on the water.  Those things you just can't get here in town and serve as a source of inspiration to me.

3979562,Communications-Media,"        but you can't use my phone.  I'm finding it quite hard to be motivated by the  urlLink seti@home  project anymore. I'm running it on less machines as the days go by & I have to admit that I appreciate the lack of heat in the room. Sure it's very helpful during the winter but at summer time, it makes getting lost with no water in the Sahara desert look like a fun game.  It's also a very good tool to realize how obsolete your system is. When you notice that people who buy PCs to 'surf the web or do some word here &amp; there', can crunch work-units twice as fast as you, if you've had a good head start, might as well quit while you're ahead. & when you finally get your ass handed to you, you can always say that it's because you're not running it anymore. ;-)  Things haven't been very calm here today.

3971148,Arts,"            I'm 27 now.  It's not bad so far, seeing as I'm only eleven hours into it.  My mom left me a note on the table that says 'Happy Birthday!' on it instead of 'Please vacuum, dust, change litter boxes, empty the A/C pail, clean your room, do the dishes, and remember to take your pills.'  My dad's notes are far simpler, written on the back of envelopes from places that want money from me, saying 'PAY THIS NOW'.  He gets to the point.  But he had 'HAPPY BIRTHDAY' written on the screen saver for me, so that was pretty damn cool.      Mike got me a windchime for my birthday, and he gave it to me a few weeks ago.  My friend Eric got me a twenty-dollar gift certificate to Amazon.com.  Dawn bought me a pint of my favourite ice cream, and two of those big cookies from Hugo's with cats and mice on them (I feel sorry for people with a vermin problem), and a 'Happy Birthday' one.  Bless their hearts.      Jenny and Greg went in on a gift together, and Jenny has been vibrating like a tuning fork because she's so excited.  She said I'd absolutely love it.  I'd love a fifty-cent toy from a gumball machine if it was gift-wrapped.  I figure a gift is something given to you that is something you didn't have before, so any gift is a great gift.

This, apparently, is umbrella etiquette in Japan. -Even the cheapest ones ($4 or $5) are better quality than more expensive ones in Canada, probably because they need to withstand friggin' TAIFUS!!   Driving:  -The roads, for the most part, are very narrow and very winding (thereby testing my motion sickness), and at sharper curves there is a mirror so you can see around it and check if anyone is coming. Stressful, yes, but with speed limits that vary between about 40 and 60km an hour, and drivers who - for the most part - obey them, it is less scary than it would be in, say Ontario, where you always go 20km  over  the limit. -When you encounter another vehicle on one of the above mentioned roads, one of you will backtrack until you get to a space where you can pull over and allow the other to pass, and this is such a commonplace occurrence that they don't even usually acknowledge one another with a polite little 'thank you' wave!   Groceries:  -I paid over $3 for 3 tomatoes. And they are NOT that big. -The only vegetables that I recognize in my grocery store are tomatoes, carrots, potatoes, and green peppers (which are tiny). My stirfry is a little lacking, needless to say.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3970345,indUnk,"       Ladies and Gentlemen, let’s do a little bit of clearing up here on the whole car issue.  A lot of people think that because I drive an old classic car around that I have to hate everything new on the street.  Much to the contrary, I actually love to see cars that have been “tricked out” modified or what have you, much the same way I would like to see it done with a computer case and system.   I don’t claim that I understand everything that goes on here.  For instance, remember the fast and furious, with those cars with the really nasty California paint jobs.  It looked like somebody had dressed the damn thing up in a sweater vest.  The clear tail lights thing kind of loses me, especially on some cars where it just stands out as not belonging. So what exactly do I like.  I like to see a Honda civic that cost the guy about a thousand dollars and still makes that super sucking noise when he stands on it and rips the gears back.  I love to see an eclipse with all wheel drive that can stop on a dime in the snow.  Now that’s respectable.  Hell I even like the blue lights under the car sometimes, black tinted windows and a sound system that makes it sound like an earthquake is on the way.  I like a smooth paint job that you can just see reflecting under the highway lights as it flies along at a hundred or so.  I love to see low profile tire and cars that look like they would hit every bump on the road but somehow don’t.   But stick a coffee can on the end of your exhaust and claim that you’re getting horsepower from it.  Then take the sticker that came in the package and put it on your rear bumper or window.  Put a spoiler the size of the car on the back and claim it’s for high speed down force.  Now your pissing me off. These are the same people who tell me I should get a cat back system for my 1968 mustang… which does not have a catalytic converter.  Tell me that I should make it look like Eleanor from gone in 60 seconds, tell every charger owner it should like the General Lee.   I love cars… period.  I just happen to think that the people driving them are worthless.  I like them enough that if I didn’t already have a classic car I would probably have one of theirs.  But I do have a classic car, it does run pretty fast, and there isn’t a chance I’m going to give it up for anything.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The summer holidays started about a week ago, and up till now I've done nothing but waste my life sitting at this computer. I've been eating as much (maybe even more) than I would in term time, and then, I get far more exercise. I'm 5ft6 and I weigh around 67kg. I've always though I was fat. Probably since the age of about 6 when my mother was telling me I should eat less, and stop acting like a pig, because then I might not look like one. I've been on diets before, but I've not really stuck to them.&nbsp; However, this holidays is going to be different. I AM going to lose weight this year. When I go back to school, I want people to go 'Wow! Pippy, you look great!' Not just the usual 'Oh, it's you.' I want to be noticed for the right reasons, not just for being the sulky, fat cow that everyone hates. This diary, is going to be by Thinspiration. I am going to succeed this year, and I'm going to meet my target. In one month, I'm going to try and lower my wieght to 55kg. I used to weight about this much at some time last year, so I don't think itwill be too hard. However, this isn't going to be my final target weight. My ideal, dream weight would be somewhere around 8 stone. I would kill to look like that. In this diary, I'm going to record what I eat, write when I'm craving food and when I'm feeling down. This diary is going to&nbsp;be my motivation. My Thinspiration. This time, I will suceed.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They introduced it by saying that none of Saddam's poems 'has been released yet, but we can imagine, can't we?'   They call me Beast of Baghdad. They're hurtful and they're snide -- But that's because they've never seen My sweet, poetic side.

3963032,indUnk,"             The Olympics are a special time, aren’t they? Only during the Olympics does NBC drop their entire late night lineup for water polo and synchronized diving. Whoop-de-fucking-do. And at any hour of the day (or night, for that matter) you can catch some Olympic action on TV. The TV schedule for yesterday was such that at any given second during the day there was a minimum of two different events on at the same time. NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, USA, Telemundo, Bravo and all sorts of NBC-affiliated networks carry the Olympics at different times of day. Who cares? After watching the USA Olympic basketball team lose to an island roughly the size of Delaware (Puerto Rico), I am officially disinterested. 92-73 was the final score in a game brought to you by the words ‘selfish’ and ‘Iverson.’ AI needs to get benched. It’s all his fucking fault. Allen Iverson is a cancer on any team, and we really don’t need him to win. A backcourt of Dwyane Wade and LeBron James is better than one with a selfish player like AI, who managed to hit five of his many shot attempts today (I believe the final count is fourteen). Plus, the reunion of coach Larry Brown with AI cannot possibly be a good thing. Since they fought in Philly, who is to say that things are any better now? Perhaps the reason is the style of play is different elsewhere, and we don't play it well. But you simply just can't tell me that Puerto Rico has better basketball than the USA. So, in that case, what's wrong with the team???          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3962045,Consulting,"             My pointy-haired boss was upset over the Maintenance Plan document that we updating late. So what's so important about this document that none of us make use of it for the whole year? Only to satisfy ISO-9000 requirement! Is this quality? Is this the quality that ISO-9000 was suppose to help us achieve? I feel like this ISO-9000 stuff is just another legalised world-wide scam, generating tones of money for the otherwise unemployed QA auditors. Because I really don't see how our customers would benefit from this Maintenance Plan that we draft on our own, then we approve it ourselves, and keep it in the folder for the whole year long. Once in a while when we're lucky to be picked for QA audit then the auditor might ask for it. Otherwise, it would be there collecting dust until end of the year, and then we stamp it 'OBSOLETE'. And start with another new document. Now tell me that this is quality work and not wasting time.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3959283,Student,"        People are too sheltered.    They sit at home all day watching fake reality.    They watch TV sitcoms where everyone seems to have a “perfect” life.    Every once in a while there is a problem in their 'perfect' reality.    They make a joke out of this problem, and it is soon resolved and everything goes back to normal.    Many people think that life should be like that, when there is no way in hell that it will ever happen that way.    If people want to live like that…you’re a dreamer.    Nothing can be perfect.    People like to think that their life “sucks” or they are terribly depressed because of things not going their way.    The reason people think their life sucks is because they suck.    They don’t know how to look at what they have and see what’s good about it, especially the upper middle class people.    They have a lot of money and a lot of things.    They have so many things and yet some will be depressed.    They get upset because of one little thing that they probably never cared about in the first place.    I was once like this too once.    When I was like 4 my great aunt gave me a quarter to get a gumball.    I was so excited (come on I was four) and I was really hoping not to get the white gumball.    Unfortunately I got the white gumball.    I was so pissed off; I think I even started to cry.    I pouted and I pouted, but yet I just stuck the gumball in my pocket.    I was still pissed as hell but we went over to the park.    There was some sort of festival going on at the time so there were a lot of people at the park.    So I waited and I waited to get a swing, and I finally got one, and while I was swinging the stupid white gumball that I didn’t even want feel out of my pocket.    Some older kids decided it would be fun to take my gumball.    Two older kids came over and started to basically play keep away with the gumball.    They had me diving in the sand and everything getting horribly dirty just for a gumball I didn’t even want.    I even started to cry.    I started to call for my Mom but when I turned around the two jerks ran off.    I started chasing after those kids as fast as my little legs would go.    I didn’t find them, and I began to cry.    I cried over a gumball I didn’t want.    I think about this and I think to myself, “What the fuck was wrong with you Mike”.    I didn’t even need the gumball.    I should have cared less if they stole that gumball, I didn’t want it so who gives a damn.    Well I did.    I wanted candy, but if it was white I was going to be upset.    It’s just like someone getting their first car.    They want a car so bad, but when they see that the only car they can get is some junked car that all its good for is going from point A to point B…they don’t want it.    They want a car but they don’t want this one because it doesn’t look good.    The car runs fine, but it looks like shit.    I say to people, “you wanted a car right?    And this is all you can get?    Then take the goddamn thing you bastard.    I mean it’s not like your first car is gonna be a Ferrari”.    I can’t even drive yet and I really want a Mini Cooper.    Well I’m pretty sure I’m not gonna get it, I’m pretty sure I wont get a car at all.    If I do…It’s gonna    be something given to me that’s a million years old.    I wont care…I’ll have a car.    So any way I was saying that people need to see the good side of things.    I wanted a gumball, but since it was white I didn’t eat it.    I should have just shrugged my shoulders and ate it.    You can’t even tell the color once you put it in your mouth.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The operations being conducted in such close proximity to the shrine of Imam Ali are risky business. It seems almost inevitable that something is going to happen to the mosque, and supposing it's even moderately serious damage, we'll have a whole new wave of Jihadists on our hands.  Which reminds me of another disturbing point. Moqtada al-Sadr's men are not necessarily 'terrorists' or 'insurgents' but something entirely different. What the Mahdi Army has become is a symbol of the Iraqi resistance -- by Iraqis,  for  Iraqis. For all the talk of foreign extremists fighting the U.S. troops over there, it seems weird not to take into account the incredible power (particularly in areas such as Najaf, Falluja, and the Sadr City slums of Baghdad) of this kind of movement.

3950835,indUnk,"       I keep having this dream over and over.&nbsp; In my dream the world has ended... I think. Every thing is dead. Above ground you hear nothing no birds no animals no breeze. The trees are all dead the ground is black as coal you can travle for miles with out seeing another living soul. In my dream I am with a goup of seven people&nbsp;RNBAJJC are the first initals of each. I think that we are the last survivors in the town. Its really interesting nothing mechanical will work. Theres no electrisity at all. And every thing is quiet for days that is until Josh makes the mistake of playing with Reds gun and firing it. Then we find out that the town has gone to hell. There is a disease that has affected almost every one in the town... there are still about 50 normal people in the town not counting us. The disease that is spreading we came to call the grey.&nbsp; If a person gets the grey there skin turns...who could guess ...grey. the grey affects people by slowly making them deteriorate while there still alive its like a worse and faster spreading leprosy. The person affected most likly always is driven insane by the pain so it goes after other people blaming them for the pain it feels. This isnt like the living dead thing all these people all still living and believe me they do die.&nbsp; Butt any ways the grey spreads by open wounds scratches, bites, and so on. So after Josh fires Reds dame gun the things swarm in attacking us and each other. We have to fight our way out there slashing, blood, death and the like. Amaya almost gets her head taken off bye Reds firing the damn gun. Bubbles which we so love calling him doesnt know wow to fight worth&nbsp;shit but gives a go with the daggers.&nbsp; He almost cut up him self as badly as he got the greys. Caden killed some major peple as did red. I got about five of them. Amaya got three, Justin got 10, and the ran off. After we got over the shock of almost dying.&nbsp; We yelled at Josh for three hours. Not only did he bring all the attention to us but he hid behind a car the hole time we had to fight...I mean even Bubbles fought and hes a peace lover.&nbsp; We were in some small town by the coast Sea side or New Port probably. We were working on making our way back to Klamath Falls. The dream continues each time&nbsp;I have it so I'll write more latter.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Till I find way home to you.     &nbsp;   Many days I've spent, Drifting on through empty shores.    Wondering wat's my purpose, Wondering how to make me strong.    I know I will falter I know I will cry. I know you'll be standing by my side.    Its a long long journey, and I need u to be close to you.     &nbsp;   Sometimes it feels on one understand. I dun even know why I do the things I do.    When pride builds me up till I cant see my soul.    Will you break down these walls and pull me through?     &nbsp;   Cos it's a long long journey. Till I feel that I am wortth the price.    You paid for me on calvary.

3941274,indUnk,"        so i think bush is better for the economy than kerry. first of all,  kerry's robin hood rhetoric of stealing from the rich to give to the poor is in its very essence anti-american. we are a capitalist nation and believe in free enterprise. kerry wants to raise the minimum wage. that will not help. all that will do is raise the prices of everything else keeping the ratio even where it is today. bush supports a welfare program that does not penalize someone for saving money, owning a home, or getting married as the current system does. this is true. because i worked through (the first three years) college i was not eligible for the pell grant, a need based grant. i made $10,000 a year and paid all my own bills including college tuition without any loans. however i have friends who lived in government housing where they were paid a monthly check to live there and were given pell grants which paid their tuition as well as enough for them to live. i was penalized for working. by increasing welfare spending we will be perpeuating the welfare cycle. no one can deny the existence of a welfare cycle. people generally stay on welfare. this does not help the poor. (the government is not even obligated to support the poor but that is an entirely different argument) kerry wants to tax the rich more than the rest of us. penalizing success does not promote progress. it is not the american way. bush supports tax relief for married people, as well as people who own homes, and he also promotes  voluntary  choice in social security. he also is in support of the opportunity for small business' to pool their resources so they can afford to provide healthcare for their employees. small business' are the largest growing employer in america. kerry wants to use government money to support healthcare and the poor. this will have to mean increased taxes. the main thing is that our money is spent by us, the citizens and not the government. increasing government spending takes control away from the people. this is socialism. the government's main purpose in america is to protect our freedom not financially support us. kerry will not protect us and he will continue to lead us in a downward economic spiral. also, remember that the economy is on the upswing. the national unemployment rate is 5.5%. we are doing well as a country.

3932080,Student,"                  This week’s CD:   urlLink Autobiography  by Ashlee Simpson   ( Week of  7/19  to  7/26)    Release date:  July 20th, 2004  Rating:   6.4/10 (3.2/5)    Get Audible:  'Shadow,' 'La La,' 'Unreachable'     'Fighting For Ashlee'   To speak fairly, almost every factor imaginable is working against Ashlee Simpson’s career. Her older sister is America’s sweetheart; comfortably dumb enough to push commercial success, which in turn makes millions comfortable enough to accuse Ashlee of riding her wave. Considering Ashlee’s picture-perfect timing (dropping her album midway through  Newlywed’s  season 2), those millions have an argument, but “Autobiography”s moral seems to be that breaking through Jessica’s PG-rated seal is nothing less than a challenge. Sisterhood has been at fault lately, evidence being the Olsen anorexia scare and the forced inclusion of Haylie Duff on Hillary’s weak “Our Lips are Sealed” cover, which is just more pressure to mount against any potential Ashlee Simpson solo triumph.  Finally, and maybe most importantly, is that aforementioned seal being PG. John Shanks (the “Autobiography” producer) has previously coached Michelle Branch (check out that Maxim spread), Alanis Morissette (sample “You Oughta Know” lyric: “Are you thinking of me when you fuck her?”), and Sheryl Crow (check out that Stuff spread), none of whom exactly blend right in with Ashlee’s expected virgin Mary image.  Still, even with all that considered, Ashlee finds clever ways around the patented image that is her sister, which are annoying in the real world (black hair?) but surprisingly delightful in the musical realm, making “Autobiography” a worthy and interesting listen, albeit a case-by-case, hit-or-miss patchwork of twelve packaged tracks.     To Ashlee’s advantage, she hits best in cases when she hits hard, and she can really hit hard. To her disadvantage, though, she spends too much time softening up, and, at the other end of the spectrum, she can really get soft (we’re talking haiku Jewel). The album’s opening third then becomes both astounding and disappointing, because while it is like a platter of Ashlee’s best songwriting and lyrical skills, it sets the bar very high for the remaining eight songs. The title track is much deeper than it sounds as the theme song to  The Ashlee Simpson Show . Starting bitterly, a crawling bass foreshadows the brilliant chorus, pure indie funk chug with that synth guitar from the Cars’  “Just What I Needed” lurking in the background. Ashlee’s tender and frank delivery, perhaps, is the song’s convincing aspect, as she rambles through both flirtation and heartbreak effortlessly.  “Pieces of You” and “Shadow” both outdo their respective familiarities, the latter trumping Christina’s Grammy-winning “Beautiful” (although it does sound suspiciously similar), the former mixing folky Jewel and Jason Mraz’s “The Remedy” into one hell of a headlining single. Actually, “Shadow” should be the album’s second single, a brilliant quasi-ballad and album standout that hopefully won’t be kept from radio just because of its Jessica-bashing lyrics (“I was stuck inside someone else’s life/and always second best”). But easily most shocking is “La La,” a wildly aggressive track about, well, more than kissing. Ashlee’s homage to Hole is undeniable as she rambles through lines like “I like it better when it hurts” and equates herself to a “French maid” and an “alley cat,” brilliantly sexing her way through a Donnas-inspired guitar thrash. The listener, inevitably, is left higher than he/she (actually just he) ever thought he’d be, starting to consider (okay, fantasize about) the doubled “e” porn-star spelling of Miss Simpson’s now more-hot-than-cute name.   Higher highs only make for lower lows, though, as both “Love Makes the World Go Round” and “Better Off” prove. “Love Makes…” sounds like Jimmy Eat World’s “In the Middle” at a third the pace, and “Better Off” just can’t find a decent melody. So, halfway through the album, bipolarity has settled for better and for worse, conveniently in that order. What becomes notable, though, is that Ashlee has so exceeded sub-par expectations that you’re suddenly fighting for her, not against her, which subtly shows that her music speaks louder than her MTV-recorded words. And while you fight for her, she fights by imitation, wearing wigs and playing dress-up to alt rock’s greater goddesses, a strategy that works well, like an audible version of “I Want a Famous Face.”      Ashlee once again pleases with tracks like “Unreachable,” in which she works up a sexy jazz steam over a “Criminal”-reminiscent piano lick (Fiona). The chorus is beautifully melodic and Ashlee is surprisingly witty (“got me heels over head”), combining to make this piece the album’s diamond in the rough. Similarly, “Love Me for Me” instantly brings Maroon 5’s “Harder to Breath” to mind, but culminates in an Audioslave-worthy chorus (which may actually be degrading Cornell & Co. more than it is praising Ashlee). “Nothing New” begins with a fast, Nirvana-meets-“Hand in My Pocket” guitar line as Ashlee croons into a Natalie Imbruglia impression (seriously, almost dead-on) for the “Wishing I Was There”-rewrite refrain, and a final highlight is “Surrender,” much-publicized on her television show, which puts together the electro-funk of Puddle of Mudd’s “Blurry” with a surprisingly bluesy midsection.   All in all, Ashlee Simpson looks not to ride her sister’s fame but to dodge it, which much of “Autobiography” succeeds in doing. She has the singles and much of the bulk to make this is a killer debut, even if she is more the wild-card of the Simpson family. Yes, the album drags out poorly (the closing duo is nothing more than average). But for such an inexperienced artist, she really brings a lot of writing talent to the table, including words that at times can be hotter than Jessica’s body. About a minute into the first track, Ashlee claims to have “a million subtleties.” While a lyric like that could end some artists’ careers (hell, if R. Kelly shared all his subtleties, no one would ever piss alongside him again), it only levitates Ashlee’s. Fact is, with her little secrets, you might want to get to know many, if not every single one.                ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thank you for being a wonderful sister to me.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last night, I had the 'TALK' again with my brother. He disobeyed me again. So I lectured him on what he should and should not do. I pray to God that what I said to him is imprinted in his mind. Hoping that he'll try one day at a time to change his ways. That's all I ask. It's never easy avoiding addiction, may it be computer games, drugs or anything. But with time and perseverance on his part, he can do it. I just pray that he'll do it and make me proud of him... =)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, my plans for this weekend is not really that hectic. I'll accompany my sister to Bridges to have her hair cut. We'll see what happens if what my friends say is true.

3924466,indUnk,"             so here is a pretty good inaugural posting for my little site here... mr. chouinard does a good job of laying out the rough edges of the case that i hope to make with my life, through words and deeds. patagonia is a fantastic company, solely owned and operated by yvon and his family. his is one of the last of the outdoor equipment and clothing manufacturing companies that has not been bought out by a corporation. one could make the argument that this better allows for him to maintain his vision of an ecologically sound, and progessive for that matter (patagonia essentially midwifed the organic cotton industry), business. it is when groupthink and the search for that holy grail, the bottom line, takes over that these ideas which are, for the most part, unprofitable in the short to mid term take over, and 'externalities' become an acceptable byproduct of corporate business.  -------------------------------  Don't Buy This Shirt Unless You Need It  by Yvon Chouinard & Nora Gallagher   Featured in Patagonia's Late Summer 2004 catalog   Near the headquarters of Patagonia, on the central coast of California, the Chumash Nation enjoyed a good life for thousands of years. They lived in small villages and possessed fur blankets, intricate baskets and soapstone pots decorated with shells. They painted elaborate abstracts in mountain caves. In every village were game-playing fields and sacred buildings. Almost every day, most Chumash enjoyed a cleansing sweat in the village temescal. In each village was a granary for stockpiling food that would later be distributed to those in need.   Chumash traded exquisite olivella shells for black pigment, honeydew melons, pine nuts, wild tobacco and various herbs and salt. By the 16th century, theirs was a complex society of hunters and gatherers with a far-reaching, sophisticated trade network.   Other nations along the western coast shared this life. Gerald Amos, a member (and former chief) of the Haisla Nation in Kitamaat, northwest Canada, recalls a friend of his father who would leave home in the dark to paddle to his trapline four miles by water. He would spend the day walking the lines, checking and resetting the traps. “Along the way back to the boat, during the late fall and early winter, the coho salmon would be still in the creeks that they passed, so they would stop at one of these creeks and take a couple of coho, which they would clean and pack home in their backpack together with what-ever animals they had taken in their traps. The fish provided them with their supper later that night.'   Such lives are often called subsistence, which brings to mind the barest, hardscrabble survival. But there is another way to look at them. At Patagonia we choose to call them “economies of abundance.” In an economy of abundance, there is enough. Not too much. Not too little. Enough. Most important, there is enough time for the things that matter: relationships, delicious food, art, games and rest.  Many of us in the United States live in what is thought to be abundance, with plenty all around us, but it is only an illusion, not the real thing. The economy we live in is marked by “not enough.” We once asked the owner of a successful business if he had enough money and he replied, “Don’t you understand? There is never enough.”   We don’t have enough money, and we also don’t have enough time. We don’t have enough energy, solitude or peace. We are the world’s richest country, yet our quality of life ranks 14th in the world. As Eric Hoffer, a mid-20th century philosopher, put it, “You can never get enough of what you don’t really need to make you happy.'   And while we work harder and harder to get more of what we don’t need, we lay waste to the natural world. Dr. Peter Senge, author and MIT lecturer, says, “We are sleepwalking into disaster, going faster and faster to get to where no one wants to be.”   We might call this economy, the one we live in, the economy of scarcity.   Lest you think the economy of abundance is gone with the old Chumash, consider Europe. Europeans still buy only a few well-made clothes and keep them for many years. Their houses and apartments tend to be smaller than ours; they rely on public transportation, and small, efficient home appliances and cars. Europeans enjoy a 25 percent higher quality of life than Americans (while we consume 75 percent more than they do).   Or, look at the people of Bhutan, whose king insists on measuring “gross national happiness.”   Any person or nation can grow fatter and fatter, richer and richer, sleepwalking toward disaster. Or we can choose to remain lean and quick, wealthy in beauty and time and, that word that inspired our forefathers, wealthy in happiness.   In Patagonia’s environmental campaign this year, we looked at the plight of wild salmon and what it might take for us to become what Ecotrust calls “a Salmon Nation,” a nation of people who make choices that contribute to the health of whole watersheds and the economies of the people who live in them. A salmon nation is a nation of abundance, where people live in a way that fish can thrive. If you think this is an impossible dream, check out Seth Zuckerman’s essay 'The Gift: Salmon Recovered' and learn how wild salmon rebounded in Alaska after the state employed sophisticated tools like sonar, stream bank counters and airborne spotters to ensure their salmon were not overfished. In the last two decades, commercial catches in Alaska have more than doubled.   At Patagonia, we are dedicated to abundance. We don’t want to grow larger, but want to remain lean and quick. We want to make the best clothes and make them so they will last a long, long time. Our idea is to make the best product so you can consume less and consume better. Every decision we make must include its impact on the environment. We make ski jackets that are the right jackets, with no compromises, yet they are elegant enough to wear over dress clothes in a storm in Paris. (Most ski jackets sit in the closet nine months out of the year.) We want to zero in on quality.   In the economy of abundance, wild salmon are given back rivers in which to run. Trees grow to their natural height. Water is clean. A sense of mystery and enchantment is restored to the world. We humans live within our means and, best of all, we have the time to enjoy what we have.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jesus used his 'Two Hands' in raising the bread that was blessed and broken for us - the bread through which we as humanity are healed and forgiven.   'Two Hands' join two people together.

Ummmm... so yeah... that was about all that happened during the day.  At around 6:00 I headed down to BJ's house and Wes and Bret were already there. BJ was playing Megaman and he kept dieing... so I laugh at you, HA! A couple minutes later Dimitri showed up with Starsky and Hutch and Mario Party. We played Mario Party for like... 10 minutes until..... umm... we stopped playing it. When our pizza arrived we all sat down and watched Starsky and Hutch, it was my second time seeing it but it was still great. By the time it was over it might have been around 10:00-11:00... I really don't know what time it actually was, but meh. Ummm... I think I watched Wes or Bret play Warcraft for awhile... or me and Dimitri may have been playing games, but eventually we all ended up around the computer.  lol, why were there so many drunk girls.....  We started out on webcam with Ash and Steph and....... well..... they were drunk. They were dancing around all slutty like and they were sick and throwing up. Wes suggested they go to the hospital or something but they said no to that. And ummm... then we moved on to Cookie and her friends, they were drunk too... except for Cookie I believe. lol and yes, happy fun times. I sure hope nobody took any pictures of anything...... *shifty eyes*...... lol :p. lol and I hope my 'dancing' in the 'skirt' entertained you girls..... haha... I don't think so. And was my face really red? 'cause it was kinda hot in that small room with five guys and no windows....  When we all decided to go to sleep...... we ended up watching another movie at around 2:30. I watched the beginning of The Bourne Identity but fell asleep possibly somewhere in the middle of it. I think I woke up when the movie was over, and the others went to sleep.... and then woke up a couple minutes later. Wes, Dimitri, and possibly Bret stayed up all night playing games. When I woke up they were already on the computer and drinking their coffee, except for Bret who was still sleeping on the couch. I woke him up by plugging his nose.... lol... and he didn't exactly like that when he got up. I watched Wes on the computer for a couple minutes until BJ got up and then we played some games, possibly for 15 minutes.

The vast majority of the people here are very friendly and helpful.  There are a handful of people that want to hurt others but that is true anywhere you are.  Here they don't really target westerners since there are so few in the city.  Everyone who has visited has said they feel really safe while they are here.  All of the people in our neighborhood look after us and some became very upset when the Bali bombing happened and took it as their responsibility to guard us.

3889861,BusinessServices,"            By Mary K. Blackmar   At the very center of the Quaker faith lies the doctrine of the Inner Light.   Briefly stated, the principle of the Inner Light is this: In every human soul there is implanted a certain element of God’s own spirit and divine energy. This element, known to the early Friends as “that of God in everyone,” or the “seed,” or the “seed of Christ,” or the “seed of Light,” means to them in the words of John “the Light that enlighteneth every man who comes into the world.”  The Quakers believe that no first hand knowledge of God is possible except through that which is experienced, or inwardly revealed to the individual human being through the working of God’s quickening spirit. So George Fox, in his Journal, is repeatedly shown commending troubled questioners to the “teacher within.” In his long, anxious search for eternal life and peace, he found no help until he learned to listen to the inner voice.  So basic is the article of belief that it governs and explains the attitude of the Friends toward many things. they include the person and ministry of Christ, the scriptures, the establishment and authority of the church and its usages of ceremony, symbolism and sacraments, and especially the intimate obligations of the individual life.  Broadly speaking, the office of the inner Light is twofold. First, it discerns between good and evil, revealing the presence of both in human beings and, through its guidance, offers the alternative of choice. Second, it opens to human consciousness the unity of all human beings.  The Quakers believe that the potentialities of evil as well as good are latent in every one. But Quakers do not share the Calvinistic conception of a chasm separating God and humans.  They feel, with Barclay, that the idea of inherited or “imputed” sin is an “invented and unscriptural barbarism.” They believe that the seed of God is as universal and potent in us as the seed of evil, and, if not resisted but nourished and cultivated, will become the controlling force in our lives. As George Fox saw an ocean of light overcoming an ocean of darkness, so the modern Quaker sees the power of God available to overcome the evil in the nature of anyone who truly wants to do the will of God. To a great extent, therefore, we are the arbiter of our own destiny, having the power of choice. Salvation, in the Quaker sense, lies in our power to become the children of God.  Closely related to this conception of salvation is the Quaker ideal of perfection, affirming that by “minding the Light,” waiting for ever fuller revelation of divine direction, the illuminated soul may eventually find it natural to live above the power or ordinary temptation. Such a life is never static, but always in a growing frame of wisdom, “shining more and more unto the perfect day.”  The Quaker sense of God’s immediate presence is the groundwork for a consciousness of human unity. Believing that all people partake in some measure of divine indwelling, the Friends are able to believe that where goodness is, there is God.  So it is possible for Friends to sympathize with the sincerity of all religious seekers. In this spirit they discover with Peter, after his vision, “Of truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.”  The attitude of the Friends toward the scriptures is a natural outgrowth of their belief in the Inner Light, Since the written word arose out of the inspiration of the spirit of God in humans, it is the spirit and not the word which is the final authority of truth.  While some religious groups have emphasized the Bible as the final and finished charter of spiritual governance, the Quakers believe in a “continuing revelation.” As the Light has shone, in the past, it has stirred the prophets, the saints and the apostles to record their deepest experiences of life and truth. So in the future, as the Light continues to shine, it should lead to further and fuller insights, to the understanding of divine new purposes, and to new powers of fulfillment.  Though the Inner Light, or the divine spirit, has always been available, the Quakers believe that in Jesus Christ the fullness of God’s divine revelation is made manifest—“made flesh and dwells among us, full of grace and truth.”  Since a sincere Friend aspires at all times and in all places to be conscious of the presence of God within, ceremonies and sacraments have but minor value.  Baptism means an inward or spiritual experience, not a ritual act. Communion is also of the spirit, and entails no outward act, being but a conscious openness to all divine intimations. The sabbath may differ in observance from other days but is not more holy.  Because Friends believe so ardently in the possibility of “immediate” or direct communion, they have felt no need of elaborate ecclesiastical establishments, organizations or authority. They were and are individualists, as well as group seekers, and in their individual lives they assume the obligation of searching out and following the will of God as it applies to them.  Through their acceptance of direct accountability, they have endeavored to make of religion a way of life. Through their individual concerns they have resisted oppression and started great movements for the righting of human wrongs.   About the Author:   Born in 1873, Mary K. Blackmar was graduated from the University of Iowa in 1910 and went on to obtain a Master’s degree from Columbia University in 1928 at the age of 55. Her literary experiences include the writing of a column for a New York newspaper and working on Columbia University’s Columbia Encyclopedia.

You know that saying true love conquers all and when you hear it you bitterly laugh, it's true.  I never thought this was possible but he changed it all and we have been married over 2 years.  I knew he was the one for me one night when we went on a walk and we just clicked and I knew it even more when he kissed me.  But with this relationship came a loss of a friend.  I never meant to hurt this friend and I think of her often.  Things got so messed up that summer that I still haven't sorted them all out.  I know that I am blamed for everything and that she hopes that I rot, but she should know me better than that.  I never ratted her out like she thinks I did.  I wouldn't have done that because I had given her my word.  I know who told on her, but she wouldn't listen to me.  I have no clue what is happening with her but I hope she is doing well and I pray for her.  I know I just went totally off of my love relationship but I just needed to get this off of my chest.

Oh wait...there's a guitar!  No, wait...I want an Xbox game.   We had been there an hour and a half when I called my wife and said 'We're back at Square One!'.  That's right.  Ninety minutes and he had selected... nothing .  Unbelievable.  Can you imagine him trying to select colleges?  How about what tie to wear with that suit?  Which wine do I serve with fish?  I say all this to say.  I love my son very much.  And he is exactly like me.  I have learned how hard it is to actually spend money.  I got $50 from my Mom for no reason last year.  I couldn't buy anything.  I'm ridiculous.  When I was in college, I spent money like it grew on trees.  Now, I'm frugal.  I can't believe it.  I now realize I passed a learned gene to my son.  Poor kid.  When we finaly selected his items (He meticulously spent $90.84), he was ecstatic, exhausted and brain dead.  But, Kyle looked at me and said, 'I don't like spending money...it's too hard.'  I just hope he remembers that.   Especially when I give his son an $185 gift card to Geoffreys in 2032.

3884080,Student,"   i swear to god its like 90 degrees outside. but yet i wont wear shorts, i only have 1 pair and i rarely wear those.  i havent really been up to much lately. ive been working, thats about it. Yesterday me and shane hung out, we didnt have anything to do so we went to exclusive company and found these awesome stickers that say 'god doesnt care' thats it, theres nothing else on them, there red stickers with white letters and that simple phrase. there cool. So after we left exclusive we went to sinners and saints (the tattoo place) and we were there for 2 hours. we just hung out with the guys that work there, there all really really awesome people. it would be cool to work there. So i got really bored while i was there so i began drawing, i drew a skull with wings coming out the side and its flying over a headstone and grave. Well shane thought it was cool and so did they guy that draws the tattoos so he said he would 'polish' it up and shane put a down payment on it. so that means shane is getting my drawing tattooed on the back of his arm. thats awesome.  man, im in a really bland mood today, im not mad or happy or sad or tired, just bored. so i dont really have anything to write about.  I got the new AP, taking back sunday is on the cover and there is a really good article about them inside. so i suggest if you like TBS then you should go read it.  I signed up for the Alkaline Trio Blood Pact yesterday. its a fan club. and when you send away to join you get a t-shirt, a poster, a bag, a membership card, a button, pin, sticker, patch. it cost $34.20 to join.

3881543,Military,"           Here is another little incident that made me question our intentions.   There is a certain group of people in Iraq who have been declared 'hostile' by CENTCOM, and last we've heard, were to be engaged on sight. Well, three days ago some people came to the base to tell us that 14 people, who matched the description of this particular group, were gathering in the woodline near their town, doing I-don't-know-what. So we sent about 50 people (the town is about 45 minutes from here) and even sent up our crippled UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle). To our dismay, the 14 had disappeared by the time our people got there (even though our scouts had 'eyes on' all along... I never figured that one out). So we get all demoralized, and bring our guys back home. Oh yeah, on the way back someone fell off the back of a truck and hurt his neck, but more about that in a minute.   The next day, after one of our convoys got hit with and IED (that's a roadside bomb, and it was in the same area where the 14 were spotted the night before) there was a report of where the 14 were that day... actually two different people told us where they were. But did we go look for them? No. We just ingnored it AGAIN. As far as we know, those people could be setting up bombs everywhere or recruiting more people into their evil army. But we're just sitting here, letting them.   So about the guy who got hurt... If we were knowingly sending our soldiers into harm's way (after all, we were going there with the intent to kill these people if in fact they were who we thought they were), why not have a damn MEDEVAC helicopter right here, waiting in case one of ours gets injured? I guess that's just too damn obvious. Instead, when the guy hurt his neck, they talked about sending someone all the way out there (45 minute drive) to see if it was necessary to have him evacuated. How much sense does that make? It's not like we're paying for the helicopter to come pick it up...   In the end, the guy was alright, he's stuck in LSA Anaconda with no weapon, bulletproof vest or even boots (they must have 'forgotten' to drop those off when they took him to the hospital). But those 14 people are still out there somewhere, waiting for the right time...         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3880669,Telecommunications,"   I have been playing on the Internet for a couple of years, mostly tournaments, mostly breaking even.  I am about £1000 down, mainly due to a brief spell of trying $100/$200 comps and some poor cash play.  In a nutshell it is not easy to make significant, consistent money in Internet tournaments, especially playing the most common form, NL Hold-em.  I have detailed the difficulties with HE tournaments below.  On the Internet there is an additional problem which is that there are so many runners.  While 10% of the field gets paid, sneaking in the money (B&M and online) tends to minimise your losses or at best keep you afloat.  You make your profit by finishing top three, and preferably winning.  When your tournaments have anything from 100 runners up, you can go a long long time in between making the big scores you need.  By the way the same argument applies to playing festival tournaments on a regular basis.   However I am on an upturn online recently, having cleared $500 this week.  Of course I had some luck along the way, but I’m now much more sure that I am playing in games which have significant positive expectation.  These games are : super-satellites, speed tournaments and Omaha Hi-Lo.  As I have the week off I will (probably – no promises) post a little bit about each one and why it’s more profitable than a standard Internet NL tournament.  Without giving away too many secrets – coaches in the car part after all :-)   ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3877004,indUnk,"           Hey everybody I just got back into Berkeley this afternoon and am checking the blogger from the public library here while Landon finishes what he described to me as 'an important experiment' in his lab.  A couple of nights ago claire and I camped on the beach in a place called Manzanita, Oregon (only a couple of miles away from the rocks in Goonies!), and it was probably the sweetest place in the world.  I know a few people on this blog have talked about moving to the pacific northwest at some point, and I'd like to put Manzanita or any of the other 10 or so towns right around there along the coast on the list of places.  I am back in Chicago late Thursday night (the 12th).  Bagel, I would definitely be up for hanging out the night of the 17th, or any of the days after that.  I know that Landon is gonna be in town next weekend, so it would be awesome if you are still around then.  Shafer is gonna be back in town for a few days as well, so I'm sure lots of people might be getting together.  Once again, sweet posts from everybody! I would, however, have liked to hear a little more from stasi on how his dates have been going.  I've been away for about two weeks and so I'm assuming there are at least 5-6 dates to hear about (I'd also like to suggest a sweet Robert Ludlum thriller: The Janson Directive.

Do 4 strides at the end of the run (see below) TRAINING FOR SUNDAY, JULY 25TH: 70 minutes slow TRAINING FOR TUESDAY, JULY 27TH: 10 minutes slow, 3x5 minutes at about a 9:45 pace, with 3 min recoveries TRAINING FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 28TH: 35 minutes slow TRAINING FOR THURSDAY, JULY 29TH: 45 minutes slow TRAINING FOR SATURDAY, JULY 31ST: 35 minutes slow.  Do 5 strides at the end of the run (see below) TRAINING FOR SUNDAY, AUGUST 1ST: 75 minutes slow  Strides are runs of about 100m.  Run at a brisk pace for about 100 meters and jog back to the start.  Repeat 4 times.  Try to keep your pace consistent on the strides.  Here is the training for the Evening Edition:  TRAINING FOR SATURDAY, JULY 24TH: 3 x 10 minutes run, 1 minute walk TRAINING FOR SUNDAY, JULY 25TH: 3 x 10 minutes run, 1 minute walk TRAINING FOR THE WEEK OF JULY 26TH: 4 Sessions of 13 minutes run, 1 minute walk, 14 minutes run, 1 min walk.  Spread the sessions from Tuesday to Sunday, August 1st.   Here is the training for Stage 1:  TRAINING FOR WEEK 1:  2 remaining Sessions of 7 x 2 minutes run, 2 minutes walk TRAINING FOR THE WEEK OF JULY 26TH: 4 Sessions of 5 x 4 minutes run, 2 minutes walk.  Spread the sessions from Tuesday to Sunday, August 1st.   Good luck everyone.  Try to stay healthy, especially the Stage 4 team.  We are starting to increase the mileage in a big way.  Remember to stretch and to take it easy on the slow days.  Ice your feet and legs if you must (if you are experiencing pain), after stretching.  Have fun and be safe.  Keep on running.

I learned about how he created a way of sorting through sources of X-rays from star clusters. It was hard for me to understand all of it, because i don't know enough about astronomy. There was not a whole lot for me to do that afternoon so i helped the remote sensing interns to research death valley rocks. We didn' t have much luck. Later that day, Dr. Richmond introduced himself to me and talked to me about his joh and experiences as an astronomer. I learned that there are two branches of astronomy: theoretical and observational. He is an observational astronomer and offered to give me work if i need it (which i do). He said that i can help him use the telescopes to take pictures of variabl stars and evenutally learn to do it myself. This sounds very exciting to me.

Ridge said it's clear that al-Qaida has the capability to carry out such an attack. He said U.S. authorities don't have information on the time, place or method, but that they're 'actively working' to gain that knoweldge.  He also said al-Qaida is working under the 'mistaken belief' that such an attack would affect the nation's resolve.  --It's only a matter of time until these terrorists infiltrate our security.

3858248,indUnk,"       © 2004 WorldNetDaily.com   The Muslim imam who gave a closing benediction at the Democratic National Convention in Boston also served as a character witness to Sami al-Arian, the Florida professor indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on 50 counts of terror-related charges.   On the second day of the Democratic National Convention, Imam Yahya Hendi said the closing prayer of the night with some verses from the Quran.   Yet, last July, the 9-11 commission heard testimony from terrorism expert Steven Emerson that Hendi, one of the top Islamic clerics in the U.S., backed al-Arian – head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in North America.  On Feb. 20, 2003, the Justice Department released a 50-count, 121-page federal indictment of al-Arian, a University of South Florida professor who's awaiting trial on charges of funneling money and support to Palestinian Islamic Jihad.   Al-Arian's close ties to both PIJ and Hamas go back to at least 1995. Al-Arian used a group he founded, the Islamic Committee for Palestine, to plead for funds for PIJ and Hamas.   Conferences organized by ICP featured Islamic Jihad founder Abdel Aziz-Odeh, Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman (spiritual leader of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers), leading Hamas official Mohammed Sakr and high-ranking Sudanese terrorist Hassan Turabi, a close ally of Osama bin Laden.   -- Why does this not surprise me that the Dems would let this vile person speak at their convention.

Moore seems to have a knack for ignoring relevant information. Upon discussing the Coalition of the Willing, he only mentions the small countries that don’t possess troops, while leaving out the countries which do, such as Poland, England and Australia.24 And of course we’re supposed to be disgusted that our armed forces possess large quantities of low-income earners and minorities, and that recruiters often go to the more unfortunate towns, looking for people to enlist. Think about that argument. Leftists like Moore are upset when a company doesn’t hire enough minorities and upset when the military hires too many! Only someone as ungrateful as Michael Moore, could be appalled at the fact that low-income earners from places like Flint, MI are “targeted” by the military and granted the greatest opportunities that America has to offer- education, money, benefits, housing, training, food and heroism. But, of course, Moore sees none of these things. He is still too blinded by his hatred for the United States and his belief that the U.S. military is the embodiment of shame.

We also have a pet tortoise named Steven.  I'll have to post a pic of him sometime.  Random business Idea--Why hasn't anyone developed a beer/liquor delivery service?  The idea is genius--when you really want more to drink you're usually 2 sheets to the wind.  If a delivery service were available you wouldn't  have  to drive on that beer run.  The store could charge a premium price--let's face it when you're drunk you'll pay a little extra for stuff anyway.  It would all be legal because the merchandise would all be unopened and the driver would be over 21 and instructed to check ID of the person paying.  Cops would be happy because it would get drunk drivers off the road.    I think this came to me living in a college town--always trying to decide which of my friends were the 'least drunk' to get more drinks.  Anyway, enough random business thoughts.

3843387,Communications-Media,   The night catches up with me  There are those silences Long and dark I wait for daylight to stay a bit longer And let out a squeal of pain As light goes out of my brittle bones  There is no hope in my world There is no need for a helping hand My cries shall not be heard from this dungeon And finally those silences Will be crowned king of my land I have no reason to wait  The sun has set There is no moon The clouds wary of every passing bat There is no inclination left  The soul sold needs no salvation There is nowhere to escape  I wrap those silences around me like a shawl Holding them close  When sun shines again  I forget to notice How can I think of anything else Draped in those silences.  ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3830235,Marketing,"           After I heard John Reese continually mentioning the importance of ad tracking, (in John's Traffic Secrets course), I realized that my tracking which I had in place so far, sucks. That's why I got myself a new script with all the sophisticated bells and whistles an Internet marketer needs. It has a lot of great features like sales tracking AND split testing. Testing is that important and my old script (DynaTracker) did not allow me to do this. Moreover, I can now even track my sales from any ads. Of course, only for websites I have full control over. So tracking of sales for any affiliate programs will not work. At least, as far as I know about that.  The best part about this script is that it is very easy to install. With a lot of CGI programs, I am getting in trouble during the installation process at one point or the other but not with this one. You are guided through a step by step setup process which includes even some screenshots from the WS_FTP software so you can see how it needs to be done. This has been the easiest CGI installation I have done so far (I have done around 7 or 8). When you get clicks to your URLs, you can even see graphical representations of the statistics and it will calculate your ROI. Sales tracking is done by means of adding an image tag to your salesletter and your thankyou page. I haven't seen this in action, though, as it is just about 30 minutes ago that I did the installation. But I am pretty sure it will work great as this tracking software is recommended by a lot of Internet marketers including John Reese.   urlLink  Click here if you want to see this tracking script in action (goes to the ProAnalyzer page)             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3829823,indUnk,"             I am in a race to write everything down.  Why is it that my mind is clear with writing, yet words slur and bounce around my mind and mouth before drooling out?  What is up with that?  The ChatChicks encouraged my starting another blog for birth stories, so I did.    urlLink http://navelgazingbirthstories.blogspot.com/   I can illustrate why I feel a certain way about things instead of sounding like I pulled an answer out of my ass.  I think many on several lists think this sometimes instead of understanding that my answers are after years of thinking, observing, researching, and experiencing certain things.  I do not parrot back what I was taught; never have.  A woman today came in that I have been talking to.  She wants to rent the space at the office for a class.  She told me a story that brought me to tears and reverberated in my head for hours.  Apparently, as a teen, she got pregnant (as a virgin) and, being from a very small mid-western town, her mom took her to another town counties away to see if she was really pregnant, which she already knew she was.  This doctor took her into his office alone and told her that he had to make her have an orgasm before he could tell if she was pregnant or not.  He proceeded to molest her with his hand and, because of her innocence, she had NO idea this was not normal.  It wasn't until YEARS afterwards that she heard of a doctor doing this and when others were shocked, she realized this was not, in fact, normal at all.  Her mother, of course, was horrified when she learned what had happened.  I cannot imagine either soul's pain.  When we were chatting tonight, we were talking about Donna as she was sharing that she might want to be a midwife now.  She had thought of it before, but her previous midwife was so aggressive and Donna had no other experience with midwives, that she thought that that midwife's behavior  was  who and what a midwife is and was.  She said tonight that after her baby's birth with me, she realized that not all midwives were the same at all and that she could see herself as  my  kind of midwife.  I was more flattered and honored than words can share!  I spoke about how important it is to let people know... our toddlers... our neighbors... know there are other ways of being.  It is so much like when those of us who grew up in shit homes... abused, alcoholic, neglected, whatever... and that is normal to us.  Until we are out of the arena and see others' lives, we just don't even think anyone lives any different.  Why doesn't the abused child speak out?  Because she thinks  every  girl gets fucked at night!  Why doesn't the laboring mom tell the midwife to get her hands off her vagina?  Because she thinks that is the way it is supposed to be.   NO ONE SAID IT COULD OR SHOULD BE DIFFERENT!   A woman I am talking with about birthrape issues speaks about her mom witnessing the birth and not saying anything and, months into her postpartum work, she asks her mom why she didn't do anything to stop the midwife from hurting her.  The mom's answer:  Because I thought that was normal... it is what happened to me at my births, too.  It is imperative to create a new normal.  Speaking up, voicing the reality, smashing the illusion of truth is crucial to our Spirit's continuity.  It is much of why I write.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3823343,indUnk,"       Interresting times.    And I can end the blog right there, because for ME that's enough.  Those two words speak volumes.  That can be seen in context to many topics I have on my mind, one of which might be shampoo on my toothbrush.    But not today, I have something else in mind.  I seem to have the knack to meet the most fantastic women.  I can count them on my one hand, but one person shouldn't be  allowed  to be blessed with their presence even just for a day.  And then I lose them again.  Go figure.  At this rate even the Aussie women look more attractive, just for the sake of pinning my hopes a little lower.  That may be my problem.  Aiming too high.    I'm just a normal everyday guy with one or two slight differences.  Both positive and negative.  I have only one positive that I can think of RIGHT NOW, and unfortunately that goes together with finding the right woman.  Back to square one.    I have joked in the past that Fate is a lesbian manhater who has one nail sharpened just for me.  And I realized something yesterday.  ITS TRUE!  Damnit.  Now before I go on, please feel free to comment on whatever I write, but note also that I am NOT repeat NOT depressed or angry or remotely pissed.  Never take me too seriously, which is something I should tell ANY good looking gal right as I meet her.  Right.  Which does bring me to an interresting point.  Are there any good looking women out there who wants to take a complete stranger to their bed and make the hot luvvin' to him?  In the general area of the United Kingdom.  Preferably with a nice smile, dark hair (optional) nice breasts and a good butt.  They should also be eager to please and not be dissapointed in premature ejaculation.  Well then, DON'T CONTACT ME about it, because seeing as he is a complete stranger, how the hell am I supposed to have his contact details?  Sheesh.  You'd think that's logic.  Over the course of this coming weekend I might or might not post, seeing as my good internet buddy Ian aka Igkuk7 is coming to visit.  Good fun, I might take him to the ZooBar, a club/ pub in Leicester Square I know of where a blonde bomb with mighty cleavaged breasts is working as waitress, name of Mua.  Very nice.  And if she reads this, I think she has a really nice personality too.  Um.  Well, enough for the moment, I think, before I get myself into some real trouble.

3814881,Technology,"            The reformed doctrine of the sovereignty of God teaches us that he does all things.  That means that when something happens, God has done it.  But He does not just ordain the end, but the means as well.  And He has designed the world so that He does things best through certain ways.    Here's an example.  When God wants to make bread, how does He do it?  Countless of millions of times, He has done it by ordaining a farmer to plant seed in the ground, blessing that seed to sprout and grow, having that farmer harvest it, and causing a baker to mix the proper ingredients and bake it.  Several times in history He has eliminated some of these steps and done it by what we might call a 'miracle'.  Jesus with the four and five thousands come to mind.    But as we pray to God for our daily bread, we would do best to look for Him to answer through the established channels- by going to the supermarket, for example.  Finding our bread there does not mean that we have provided it and God has not, or that the mundaneness of the answer to our prayers makes it any less miraculous.  Gratitude and belief should never be conditioned on the 'supernatural' quality of God's work.  All of His work is both natural and supernatural at once.    Furthermore, we should seek to understand the means God has ordained for the end we want to pursue.  Attempting to work to an end contrary to God's means is foolishness, and asking God to bless it is arrogance.  Implications?  Youth ministry and education should be done primarily by parents.  Evangelism should be through worldview advancement.  Cultural reformation should be accomplished through repentance and reformation in the Church.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3811554,Internet,"       Actually, thats a lie.  I don't want to be tree!!!  Trees are dull. They never move, go out, party, or do any of the exciting things I aspire to be able to do in my own life.  I was asked an interesting question the other day by my mother.  My mother wanted to know if I believed in God.  I thought about it for a while, weighing up the pros and cons of destroying my mother's relious beliefs before telling her that I don't believe in God.  Its one of the things that I have considered plenty of times in the past and one of the things that I am going to discuss now.  I find the thought of one persona governing all of mankind to be absurd.  I know, he/she/it is meant to be all-powerful and all the rest, but I don't trust that.  Too many things can and have gone wrong, wars, plagues, racism and all the other problems in the world.  If we are to believe the Christian bible then we have to accept that God gave us choice.  This was his first big mistake for with choice comes the power to do wrong.  Something tells me that God didn't think this through fully.     I prefer to believe in myself(this is where it gets interesting). I don't hold God resaponsible for my actions.  I blame my parents for putting me on this planet but I take full responsibility for all my actions(unless I am crafty enough to frame another person).    I have full confidence in my abilities and I know that I will be the judge in deciding how well I do in life.  If I choose to laze around then I should expect to always be on the lowest rung of the ladder.  Any improvements in my life will be as a result of the effort that I have put in to improve my life.

Nothing in the world can ever repay what they did.   Mr Tan Woon Wee; HOD DnT & Teacher- This is a great guy who can show you that school is where one learns to take responsibility and teaches his students that hard work ALWAYS pays off. He's a degree holder but pretends to be unknowing malaysian educated teacher who doesn't understand what his students say but actually does and his favourite phrases are 'Y0U RUBBISH!!!', 'NO INTEGRITY!!!', 'CANNOT BE TRUSTED ONE!!!', 'NO SELF RESPECT!!!' 'YOU BETRAYER!!!', and a recent addition, 'You betrayerER!!!' when he says this he's actually trying to reprimand a student or make a point to a class in his seriously lack of vocabulary but incredibly understanding ability of bombastic words in English. The whole class including the student would be laughing uncontrollably right in his face. It looks as if theres no recpect but every student that knows him, remembers him, respects him and whose life has been somehow touched by him :)   Ms Saadiah Saadon; The best English Teacher that Greenview has and will ever have whose brimming with ideas, solutions and passion for her job and students. English would never be the same without you! Thanks a Million!   Mr Chionh Chye Aik; My secondary 3 form teacher and the math teacher who didn't give up on me. I had flunked my sec 1 & 2 math without a hope in the world of even touching a pass when he, like the light at the end of a cold dark tunnel of numbers, formulas and wierd equations, came into my life and showed me that math wasn't as bad as it seemed. I attained an A1 or an A2 in math for all tests and exams thereafter.   Mrs Law Chor Hoon; The secondary 4 math teacher of my class. A honour of having the most senior and oldest math teacher in the school whom is carrying years of service excellence under her belt or a dread at having the strictest teacher that we had ever encountered in our Tenth year of compulsory education? I may never know. Why? Well firstly, i found she gave to many worksheets, like ten a day; each a past year exam(paper 1 & 2) from other schools. Secondly, Thank God i had German classes or Choir on the day of her remedials, which was practically everyday except sunday which she staunchly believed was for the practicing of math and math only. Thus i so unfortunately[yeah right] missed her classes :) To top it all of, she would constantly tell all the teachers that 4E3 was the worst math class in her entire life and that she had no more blood to vomit(i never did see her throw up before though) and that math was the most important thing to this class. Well the other teachers supported us and despite her protests, we would attend the others instead insisting that we sucked in everthing else too and she was quite concerned to hear that and to our utter confusion, dissapointment and added stress, shared what we told her to the rest of the teachers again. The June holidays never arrived for the the class of 4E3... Save One :). whoelse?   Muhd. Zahier B Amza; I have known this young man since 1E3 and we have both grown and changed together. We have done every school/class/subject/group project together for as long as i have known him. Why? Simply because he is a Great Team Player and can be counted on always.   Muhd. Rahimi B Hussein; Another young man that i've known since 2000. We were put to sit next to each other since mid-2002 and all through 2003. I don't know how, but he tolerated my nonsense and allowed me to.. er.. 'refer' to his english/math/geog/social studies homework when i.. er.. didn't have enough time to complete mine... He was obviously a great resource person and one who was able to see the funny side of things.   Ashley Tome Joseph; With him we i was able to share my thoughts on life, school, teachers, homework, girls, games and priesthood. He is still a person i can call up to have a chat with and share a real language joke or a play on words that most in the school wouldn't grasp fast enough. We were part of a small handfull of students whose English Language ability was beyond the others. I remember Ms Saadon telling us to bear with her lessons when they were indeed to simple for us as it was for the sake of the class.  For my class, there were five of us who were considered adept in the English Language. Namely Ashley, Lydia, Sabariah, Elly and yours truly. This would be obvious when ms Saadon would blurt out in the midst of teaching a joke or phrase that ended with the five howling with laughter and tears and the others looking with appalled looks and firmly believing that this teacher and these students had well and truly lost it.   Lydia Norman; A girl who showed me that one must learn to let there hair down on occasion and not be too orderly all the time. An extrovet by character, i got to know her through the choir and when we took the same bus home. We became close friends who could exchange views on almost everything under the sun and felt no restrictions whatsoever because of gender differences.   Teddy, Aroon, Timothy, Ji Nin, Russell, Kelly, Amanda, Kai Deng, Perry, Pavel; German was the most interesting class i attended but you guys changed that.

Someone Special to Me:  There are many people who have made an impact on my life in someway and i have not recorded most of them because of a lack of time and memory space. There is one person i want to introduce to you. I have only met her twice and yet i keep asking myself, 'Why do i keep thinking, dreaming and wishing to have this girl by my side?' There are so many other girls in this world but she stands out the most. Why? I haven't the slighest clue. I just like her and am attracted to her. Think about this,' What makes the perfect girl to you?' Smart, Attractive, Sporty, Outgoing, Adventurous, Friendly, Logical, Level Headed and a great sense of humour. Sounds too much to ask for? Well yes. Initially i thought that too. Until i saw her and that all changed. All of the above could summarise her. Or am i exagerating? I doubt it. To her i have this message: In life, not all things go as we hope for. It does seem immposible from where we are. We are like two people living in the same country but worlds apart. Two systems, two views, two seperate paths to our destinies and two years apart. Against the odds, we met. The chance meeting is but a fading memory now. However i try to move on, i am held back by people i see on the street who remind me of the one thing i remember well, your face. Maybe i'm not trying hard enough to forget you. Should i try harder? I have already thought less about you and dreamt less. I hope one day, i won't just be recalling your face but see you in person, as i did once 11/4 years ago, standing next to me. Even if it were for a moment, it would last a lifetime...  1.8.87 & 1.8.89, December 2002- August 2004 Turn Left, Turn Right(not to be taken literally, duh)          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3801191,Student,"                 *MEEEMMMOOORRRIIIIEEESSS...AALLL ALLOONNNEEE IIN THE MOONLIIGHT...*  *er hem*  *switches off radio*  Was lookin at old photos today...yep, photos from WAAAAYYYY back when...  Yup, happy memories of my childhood... old friends... birthday parties...*sighs*  I've come to realise somethin today...  Friends come...friends go...  But photos are always there to remind you of all the happy times u shared with them.  I also took some time to ponder this point, how many of my friends from the past are still my friends now?  Well, i found out one thing's for sure, friends may come and go...but true friendships ALWAYS survive the ravages of time and distance...as i found out recently.  Recently, i hooked up with an ex-neighbour of mine, Samantha. Now, ive lost contact with her for many years, but when we met up, we chatted and fooled around just like we did in the past.  Ok, backtrack a bit...lemme explain to u guys our past...  Samantha and I were great friends when we were young. We used to cycle together every afternoon, and do all sorts of crazy stuff together. Stealin rambutans (yes, i was too young to know jak shit bak then...lol), playin with mimosas, fooling around in the park...ar..too many things to mention! We did lots of stuff together, and our friendship grew and grew...  Till one day...that fateful day...the day i would never forget...  Well, it was pretty normal, but for some reason i still remember that day like no other...  I still remember the only strange thing that happened that day, was samantha was unusually quiet for some reason, and right after our usual 2 hour session of playin... she handed me a piece of paper and ran off crying...  I didnt really think much of it until that evening. I pulled the letter out of my pocket and read it...  The reaction was immediate, teras welled up in my eyes, and i cried...  She was movin the next mornin, and she didnt leave me with any contact no....  I was p5 bak then, and i had a hard time gettin over that...  Well, its been slightly over 2 years since that day...and just a month or so ago, i met up with Samantha once again. I had found her through a friend of mine. We chatted for a week or so, and then we agreed to meet up.   That mornin, i was dressed in my finest (well, finest meanin a quiksilver polo and jeans anyway...), and sittin in coffee bean sipping a huge cuppa (wat is it with their huge cups???). All of a sudden, my world suddenly went quiet, and my eyes suddenly affixed onto a WOOOOOOOAAAAAHHHHHHH young lady standin at the door for some reason...the next thing came as a real shocker...  'SHERWIN TAY!!! IS THAT U?'  Samantha???  Boy had she changed since the last time we met...she had gone from the sweet, innocent, little girl-next-door, to an intelligent, witty looker...she had matured a LOT (same cant b said for me though). Still, though we just barely managed to recognise each other after so long...we chatted like old pals, picking up where we left off..and catching up on years of stories...  My point is? No matter how much time u spend apart from a friend, or no matter how little contact u make with the person, as long as the friendship is true...itll last forever                      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3793386,InvestmentBanking,"             It will be interesting to see how the campaigns deal with  urlLink this grim finding :   The overall income Americans reported to the government shrank for two consecutive years after the Internet stock market bubble burst in 2000, the first time that has effectively happened since the modern tax system was introduced during World War II, newly disclosed information from the Internal Revenue Service shows.  The total adjusted gross income on tax returns fell 5.1 percent, to just over $6 trillion in 2002, the most recent year for which data is available, from $6.35 trillion in 2000. Because of population growth, average incomes declined even more, by 5.7 percent.  Adjusted for inflation, the income of all Americans fell 9.2 percent from 2000 to 2002, according to the new I.R.S. data.  The Democrats will likely have a field day with that 9.2% number.  Of course, a careful review of the data show that the hit is being taken mostly by the wealthy, who have seen their capital gains wiped out in the Clinton-era market bubble.  So the Republicans can retort that the rich aren't really getting richer and cannot endure the higher marginal tax rates that Kerry is promising.  Also expect reasoning like this: 'The expanding deficit isn't being caused by the Bush tax cuts, but rather by the lack of capital gains to tax.'  Then there's this tidbit:   The stock market decline also affected the incomes of those between $1 and $5,000, which includes large numbers of children in affluent families with investments for college costs. Incomes for that group fell 7.8 percent over the two years, to $33.3 billion, as dividends fell and those who had to sell equities in the depressed market to pay tuition reaped smaller gains in 2002.  Maybe not Kerry, maybe not Edwards, but   somebody   in the Democratic Party will bemoan the decline in income among 'the nation's children,' conveniently leaving out the fact that it's really just the trust-fund babies.  As is so often the case, this report has enough raw data for just about everyone to find   something   to support their side of the tax debate. Hopefully the distortions will not get too out of hand (I'm not optimistic).

3787373,Consulting,"             I have a big problem with the Php5.50 jeepney fare.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for the jeepney fare increase. I think it's only fair. I had always thought that by not increasing the fare earlier, we're not getting as much out of it as much as what is being lost by the jeepney drivers. And I always had a problem with oil deregulation; you could find a bunch of arguments about the topic, but to me it's a matter of the government letting jeepney drivers shoulder losses that oil companies are not willing to take.  But all of that's beside the point. Here's my beef with the jeepney fare being Php5.50:  IT'S FRICKING 5.50!!!   There have been many theories about why the the prices have been increased to Php5.50, the most popular being that the President was playing politics with the jeepney drivers and throwing them a bone in exchange for their support. But why Php5.50?  Personally, I think the higher-ups are screwing with the jeepney drivers. Could you imagine being a jeepney driver at 6 in the afternoon, rush hour in Cubao? Your jeep is packed tighter than Diana Zubiri's tube top, the MMDA officer is leering at you like you're Joyce Jimenez, the dude beside you has worse B.O. than your favorite Bumbay, it looks like it's going to rain, and everyone else around you is driving like a maniac (it's always their fault). You're handed a twenty and a fifty, one's for three fares and the other's for five. Quick, how much do you give back to each? No calculators or pens, and no counting with fingers, either. And you still have to *actually* drive and get the people to where they're going safely, remember?  I'm thinking about it, and it makes *my* head hurt. And I used to go out with a physicist.  I really hope the prices for oil don't increase anymore, for the sake of the poor drivers. If they ask for another price increase, the government could really fuck them up for good. Like, peg the fare at Php6.75.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It feels like yesterday but when I count it in years it is ages ago. Or at least four years.I sometimes find my self trapped in time, going back and re-living all these special moments. It is one thing about things that happened only four years ago, but sometimes I just get a hunch, a feeling, that just won't let go. Like last month when I met a person that I recognized, but was sure I had never met before. It took a day or two after the meeting before I realized that this person reminded me of my grandmother, who died for more than ten years ago. When I was talking to this person I had no idea about why I felt so good and all warm inside. It was not the personality that resembled my grandmother, it was strictly the looks. I must admit that I don't remember very much about my grandmother, since I was not old when she passed away.But still, I liked the feeling. When I met her again the magic was gone, I didn't think she looked like my beloved grandmother anymore. Although this meeting has made me think about my grandmother, and sometimes I can get this 'hunches' about her. I can again see her in my mind sitting on the chair by the window in her kitchen, I can hear her very special dialect and some very special things she used to say.It feels grate that I can still make this things come back, things I thought I had forgotten, but had only hidden somewhere deep in my mind.When me and my sister wisited my grandparents grandmother always used to give us melon-icecream.

3777538,Student,"       the past few days have been sadly uneventful. as much as i would like to practise my writing, there is simply nothing to write about: no vivid fantasies, no falling in love, no catastrophies, no nothing.  even the 'fairy-tale', or greek mythology as the chinese papers call it, of greece becoming european champions is are hardly interesting - well, simply because it's just a football game. even the greatest tales of the greatest games don't do anything, so why should this one? after all, they are but games, playing things. if you would look at the core concept of football - of kicking a round thing to and fro - you will realize that it is truly meaningless. but well, i suppose humans get bored, and they have to do something.    in fact, i can hardly recall what i have done these few days - plenty of gaming surely, but nothing else. it is almost as though a void is present in my memory, and that, creates a strange (unpleasant) sensation, a sensation of emptyness that i once again start to feel. maybe the screw-up lies in me, but i am sure, life is indeed boring and uneventful. many, i believe, agree with me, many more will if they consider carefully; it has even been brought up in parliament. it may be that my young mind grows impatient with routines and seeks adventure, it may be that i do not appreciate peace and tranquility (i would hardly call my current situation that), it may (most likely) be i do not like how time comsuming and mundane school is, but as far as i am concerned, there is a problem. i do not know how to fix that problem, and i am troubled. unfortunately however, whining does not help, not mine, not yours, not anybody's. we just have to carry on, and hope something better comes. blah blah  because of this reason, coupled with my poor memory, 16 years of my life has given me hardly anything to look back on. i started this blog to hopefully remedy the same situation that would occur in the future somewhat. when times are as such that there is nothing to look forward to, not being able to look back is painful. if you would make a metaphor of this situation, it would be like being stranded on an island 3 metres wide, and 3 metres long, with nothing on it but sand and mainland nowhere in sight.   well, times are as such that there is precious little excitement. perhaps that would change, perhaps not, we'll see.

I was responding to&nbsp; urlLink this odious column by Kathleen Parker , who is one of those so-called 'compassionate conservatives.'  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Since they don't publish letters to the editor on line, I'll copy it here ....  &nbsp;    Kathleen Parker’s tirades against gay marriage are illogical and far too simplistic. Most recently (July 9, 2004), she asserts that gay marriage will harm children and that fathers should be particularly upset about this development.  &nbsp;  She lumps together all men who have children into one group, ignoring for instance those gay men who have had children and want to be a parent to their children.  &nbsp;  In fact, we all know people who turned out wonderfully even though they were raised in nontraditional ways, just as we all also know people who had terrible upbringings in traditional families.  &nbsp;  Actually, Parker should realize that sex and gender roles do not necessarily overlap in neat stereotypical ways. There may be feminine men and masculine women. Children obviously their gender roles from a variety of sources, not just from some 1950s television sit com model.  &nbsp;  Most importantly, it should be noted that in many states, including Washington, gay couples can already serve as foster parents and adopt children. By all accounts, they have done as good a job of parenting as anyone else. Why shouldn’t those couples be allowed to marry if they believe it is important to their children and families?       I got some nice responses from some people, and some noncommittal acknowledgement by others that they had seen my letter. &nbsp; &nbsp; Earlier gay marriage observations: &nbsp;  urlLink HRC Ad   urlLink Lynn Cheney   urlLink Gay Marriage  &nbsp;          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dawn of the Dead (1978): yes, this is the original, which is the sequel to night of the living dead. first, the bad. it is cheesy. half the music is terrible, the other half is wisely done. the acting is not the greatest. there are continuity issues left and right. the story never ends (in fact, the last chapter of the trilogy is day of the dead, although i won't be seeing that because there is no ending to that either). now the good. the blood is about as much as kill bill vol. 1. the special effects are kinda humorous, but really good for its time. it can still be appreciated 25 years later. and this is extremely entertaining. i haven't seen the remake of it (i'll see it in about a month), so i can't compare to that, but as far as a horror movie goes, this is one of the best i've seen. see it.

3771286,indUnk,"                 Well Mondays are always such a drag.  Lots and lots of paperwork and no motivation to do it.  My boss called me today and asked if I would be interested in advancing with the company.  Sounds interesting but I don't know if I want to do anything more than I already am.  I've decided I am just not a go getter type of person, I just want to live comfortably and take it easy.  But it was nice to have my bosses' boss say they liked the job I was doing.  Kudos to me!  I ordered some purses online and I am very excited, they should be coming sometime this week.  Yea..  Tomorrow I am going to Sandpoint to see some friends and soak up some sun (hopefully).  Off to bed I go.      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3766618,indUnk,"    ~The Start~    &nbsp;  I can't remember. But it seems to me that it is this 'little theory' which I declared in the cyberspace that caught her attention.    &nbsp;  If I have a million dollars, I would buy a house. do I have a million? No. That's why I don't have a house.    &nbsp;  If I have wings, I can fly. do I have wings? No. so I can never fly.    &nbsp;  If all the waters are drawn out of Pacific Ocean, but it still can't put off the flame of love between us. Can all the waters of Pacific Ocean be drawn off? No. That's why I don't love you.    &nbsp;  That's me, a typical science student. First you come up with an assumption, then you fit a suitable conclusion.If the proposed assumption doesn't stand at all, then everything is just bullshit. I guess this is what they call 'unromantic'.    &nbsp;  But she is an exception. she actually mailed me and said that I am an 'interesting' person.'Interesting'? What a word to use on me, it's like using 'faithful' on Mr. Clinton. I thought this girl must be a low-IQ organism, or suffering from serious brain damage.    &nbsp;  Anyway, her nick doesn't seems so bad -FLYINDANCE- that's quite a unique one.But I was warning myself: hello, this is the virtual world of Internet. Who knows what might be lurking behind a beautiful nick.Talking from experience, most of the time it will be a 'dinosaur' in disguise. The only differences will be whether it is a carnivore or a herbivore but, I know she is way different from a 'dinosaur', she is special.    &nbsp;  So I guess its time for the appearance of FlyNDance.Ever since she mailed to tell me that I am 'interesting', I was always wishing to meet her in AJCRR. Too bad, lady luck was just not on my side.    So I can only reply her letter to tell her that I will start to train myself to become an 'interesting' person, just to show that she is far-sighted.    &nbsp;  She replied my reply, I replied her reply to my reply, she again replied my reply to her reply blah blah blah... Oh no, I just started a chain-reaction.     &nbsp;  Actually what interested me the most is this paragraph she wrote in one of the mails....    &nbsp;  'I dance swiftly, amidst the crowd.   Your glance on me be it surprise,be it admiration,    it ain't going to stop my rhythm.   Because it's not your glance that made me dance,   it's my heart of youth.'    &nbsp;  I simply cannot relate this girl to any of the 'dinosaurs'. But if she really is a dinosaur, I am willing to let her have her fill.    &nbsp;  Tye, my best pal unfortunately, noticed my little affair with FlyNDance, and has been perpetually warning me about this.    &nbsp;  'HELLO! You don't even know what she looks like, why take the risk?? Maybe 'she' is a guy!'I can't blame Tye for his ignorance.     &nbsp;  Ever since he was dumped by Sally in Secondary 4, he has become a renowned 'playboy'.    &nbsp;  As the saying goes: 'Once bitten, Twice shy'.    &nbsp;  In this case, after Tye was bitten, he has mastered the art of skinning snakes alive, and make them into soup. But he got all the factors to be a playboy, I always think he is the 19 year-old version of Brad Pitt.Tall, handsome and got this tongue that causes diabetes in every women he targets. I don't think he can even remember how many girlfriends he has had.    &nbsp;  I went online that night, log onto channel AJCRR and yes! She is there. Before I can get over the surprise and the daze, she sent me a message.    &nbsp;  'Hey slorr, so late liao haven't sleep ah?'    &nbsp;  Now what? Now what? Ok ok, I had to calm down first. I swallowed hard on my saliva, took a few deep breath. Now where is that Tye when I needed him most at such crucial moment, somebody to tell me what to say to her. How am I going to attract her with my pathetic humour which has gone stale.    &nbsp;  'Slorr, me in a foul mood today. Can't sleep, you leh?'    &nbsp;  MOTHER'S (direct translation to chinese), what slorr slorr...    &nbsp;  'Ok, but you haven't greet me leh.'DAMNIT!..     &nbsp;  how can I forget simple manners to gals. To think they call me 'MR COURTEOUS' in school.If this thing ever leaks out in school, I would lose all my female fans.    &nbsp;  'Nice to meet you, miss long-hair.' I've been wishing that she's keeping long hair.     'Since you are feeling down, how can I ever be happy?' &nbsp; I know it sounds mushy, but Tye said: 'MUSHINESS IS THE FUNDAMENTAL TO ALL COURTSHIP.'And gals are a very weird species, they trust their ears far more than their eyes. So instead of doing 10 things to impress her, why not just say a sentence to move her. &nbsp; Tye said that:   'FlyNDance... hmm.. she would either be long-haired or a desperado, 'COs when gals dance, only 2 parts of them may fly: hair and skirt. So if she doesn't has long hair, that means her skirt flies when she dances, AH-HA!!.. this has a certain sexual hint in it...haha..'  &nbsp; 'Eh? How you know I got long hair?' &nbsp; BINGO! Heaven is on my side this time. It goes to prove that she is not a DESPERADO. Yes! &nbsp; 'Not only that, I also know you seldom wear skirt.' &nbsp; I increased the stake, if I am correct this time, peace on earth forever. &nbsp; 'Err... I guess you are right lor. But how you know one?'' &nbsp; 'Just guess.' &nbsp; 'Ok lor. Hey slorr, tell you what, me tired liao, you coming online tomorrow morning?' &nbsp; 'Ya, why??' &nbsp; 'Please please please say the you coming too, if not I am going to kill myself for letting you go tonight. I'll see ya tomorrow at 10 am then. Good night.' &nbsp; 'Er.. should be today at 10 am.. ok.. good night too.'I just blurted out a last sentence ....Offline. &nbsp; Suddenly I was so impressed by my performance just now. But is the season of spring really arriving for me??I wish. &nbsp; 'Slorr, what a coincidence ahh' &nbsp; 'Yeh, I am not late.' &nbsp; 'Ya lor, so qiao.' &nbsp; Girls are weird, I thought we already had an arrangement, why do I have to pretend that its not.They must have watched too many movies, and like to think that guys they met due to the thing called 'fate' is the best thing that can happen to their love life. &nbsp; 'Slorr, you talking nonsense lah.' &nbsp; 'NONSENSE? Ok, let me tell you what is nonsense. Summer's beach, the guy must be good at running, with broad shoulders, dark complexion with a tint of redness, sparkling eyes and loud laughter.Then he will call out loud the name of the girl, running towards her, carry her and spin 3 rounds anticlockwisely.' &nbsp; In real life, the guy on the beach may step onto broken glass or the girl may be too heavy which tore his arm muscles. &nbsp; Birds may just clear their waste on top of the guy in the mountains, or he might get a thrashing from the girl because he comments on the excess fats around the waist and hips.' &nbsp; 'Ok, good. I am not romantic, neither are you.' &nbsp; 'Slorr, you hate romance?' &nbsp; 'I hate romance? Nope, I am just using my knowledge of statistics to get a deduction, that guys must be TALL to be romantic, not HANDSOME!!! Some love novels even portrayed the guy as normal looking, but no-one dares to challenge the height of him! I object, because I am not tall.' &nbsp; '-Slorr.... objection overruled...' &nbsp; I think I am really outstandingly bo liao, talking to her about these until noon. &nbsp; 'Slorr, are you hungry?' &nbsp; 'Ya, you leh?' &nbsp; 'Yes, guess its time for lunch...Slorr..' &nbsp; 'Then do you think we should?' &nbsp; 'Slorr, I am just asking. I don't intend to have lunch with you.' &nbsp; 'Ok, good. I am not romantic, neither are you.'  &nbsp; I&nbsp;had lunch with Tye, we talk about the conversation with FlyNDance this morning. &nbsp; 'You moron. Told her you are not romantic, you siao ah? You have disgraced me man. How can you make such a big mistake?' &nbsp; '....I...I...' &nbsp; Tye grabbed a chicken wing with chopstick, and I can see the trembling of the hand and the wing. &nbsp; 'There are 3 'don'ts' in chasing a girl... &nbsp; One, don't forget to be romantic; Two, don't be too honest; Three, don't be too stingy on the sugar in our speech. &nbsp; In mandarin, we say 'nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai', you should know this.' &nbsp; 'This I know, but it has been a controversial topic over centuries. Women aren't really that, cheap' &nbsp; 'So why would they only falls for 'bad guys' like me? &nbsp; ''That's because 'bad guys' are usually romantic. Those 'nice guys' are usually, dumdums. So she would rather choose a romantic 'bad guy' rather than any of those dumdums. In maths we call this 2C1, understand? dumdum. &nbsp; 'Oh, Tye is talking about maths! Now I understand. No wonder I have always been left on the shelf.' &nbsp; In another words, gals wouldn't mind if you are not tall...if you are not handsome...they can bear with your inconsiderate acts...can forget your stupidity...but they can never forgive if you are not romantic...' &nbsp; 'Come on, this is so exaggerating.' &nbsp; 'Hey, most women have a 'knot' for romance, just like most men have a 'knot' for virginity.  &nbsp; To women they just can't understand how precious the thin layer of membrane is to men. Same thing, men can't imagine how important women treats romance.' &nbsp; 'This is bullshit! How come I've never heard of that.' &nbsp; 'The key word is 'knot', if you can untie it, fine. But how many had actually succeeded in that. practically none.' &nbsp; 'ok, fine. now I've done it. So what should I do to remedy the situation?' &nbsp; 'Face it. You are hopeless already.' &nbsp; I promise you I'll have a drink with you when you and her are over.' &nbsp; You SONOFABITCH. &nbsp; Midnight. I am trying to concentrate on my physics notes...F=ma, v=u+at...It's really a wonder that nature can be explained by just a few formulas and equations, and this we call science.. &nbsp; Then why is astrology and palmistry being labelled as superstitions? Science should only be one of the ways to explain truth, what can't be explained by science, it doesn't necessary mean that it's unreal....Close to 1 am.  &nbsp; Since I can't get anything into my head, I shall try my luck on net then, maybe she is there. &nbsp; 'Slorr, you here.' &nbsp; 'Finally, good night to you ' &nbsp; 'FINALLY'? Strange word to use it here. What is she doing here at this hour? Must be feeling down again. &nbsp; 'Yes, it is fate that brought me to you at this moment.' &nbsp; I am trying very hard to convince her that I am a bit romantic. &nbsp; 'Slorr, nothing to do with fate. I waited for you for one hour liaoz...' &nbsp; 'Sure or not? For what?' &nbsp; 'Talk to you mah or else I can't sleep.' &nbsp; 'You sick is it? Go see doctor lah ' &nbsp; 'Slorr, let's continue our topic.What do you think of relationships that began from the internet?'Oh my god, how should I answer her now? &nbsp; 'It's... it's very... romantic...' Indeed I am not a good liar, even my words are shaking now. &nbsp; 'Slorr, you bluffing. You not romantic one mah.' &nbsp; GAME OVER. I am finished! No choice but to drink with Tye. &nbsp; 'Slorr, you lagging? Or just daoing me?' &nbsp; 'No, I am wondering why is the sky so chio tonight?' &nbsp; 'No no no. Don't try to shift the topic, Slorr.' &nbsp; Sigh. I give up. I asked for it myself. &nbsp; 'Actually I think relationships started from cyberspace is considered as ROMANTIC, cos romance gives people an impression of unreal, and cyberspace is virtual.' &nbsp; 'Slorr, that's interesting.' &nbsp; 'Surfers keep a safe distance from each other and usually 3 types of people are produced in this way. &nbsp; The first type....The first type being those who present themselves on net with their 'secondary personality'. Usually all of us consists of multiple personalities, and in everyday life, what we present to the world is the 'primary personality', with the secondary one being suppressed, or maybe we don't even realised this other trait of us deep inside. So internet is the place where this side of us is revealed, both intentionally or without conscious knowledge.' &nbsp; 'Is it true? What about 2nd type?' &nbsp; 'The 2nd type are those who will transform themselves into the kind of man/woman he/she would want to be. There's bound to be 1 or 2 characteristics that you particularly admire, too bad, sometimes these characteristics are just couldn't be found in you. Cyberspace is the perfect location for this transformation to occur.' &nbsp; 'Slorr, you blowing cow is it? Type 3 leh?' &nbsp; 'I am not blowing cow, I read it from an article of TIMES magazine! Type 3 will be those who transform themselves into characters which are impossible for them to become in real life.For example, if you are a girl, you may act as a man on net. You may even become BATMAN or SUPERMAN if you want.' &nbsp; 'Hmmh.. That's pretty amazing.' &nbsp; 'The first type is the 'faithful' type, 'cos its his own personality that is being presented on net. &nbsp; The 2nd type is the 'foolish' type, 'cos he knows only how to admire others, always forgets his own strong points. &nbsp; The 3rd type is the 'pathetic' type, 'cos he is wishing 4 something impossible.' &nbsp; 'Slorr, then you belong to what type? Me leh?' &nbsp; 'I don't wish to believe you are type 3, 'cos I am not.I crossed the possibility of type 1 'cos its too common, because I think you are special. Being able to attract you, I think I am at least a bit special. So we belong to type 2.' &nbsp; 'Type 2, then who you wish to become? Slorr..' &nbsp; I certainly would like to become a person like Tye, humorous, romantic and eloquent, 'cos these are what I am lacking of. &nbsp; 'Slorr, what about me?' &nbsp; 'you? I don't know. you want to FLY and DANCE, probably that means you wish to fully enjoy your youth while you can.  &nbsp; But if this is somethng you wish yet you can't achieve, then there's 2 possibilities:1, you are aging, 2, you are leaving the world.' &nbsp; I think I said something wrong, cos she didn't sent me anymore message after this. I began to blame myself for being so perverted, why talk about these things? &nbsp; &nbsp; I should have discussed with her whether ZOE or FANN, who should be the queen of Caldecott Hill. Damn that TIMES magazine, poison my mind. Maybe she's lagging. so I waited... and waited. Girl its just a few minutes, but it felt like several hours.  &nbsp; I want to apologize, but do not know how to start. until she sent me this message: &nbsp; 'Slorr... let's meet...' &nbsp; Without hesitation, I used the hand that I had used it over 18 years to wipe my ass, typed 'O-K'. &nbsp; I am supposed to meet FlyNDance tonight , 8pm, at the entrance of McDonalds, the one beside YMCA. That's the best time and place to meet a girl you have never met before, according to Tye, 'cos they would have taken their dinner by that time which means we can simply go inside the Mac and have some fries and coke.She will be wearing a whole set of coffee theme attire and I will be wearing my usual blues, this is our way of identification. she told me she is not those 'cute gals' I may think she is, I said nevermind, I am not Brad-pitt either. then she told me she has long ago given up on this hope already. &nbsp; 'Slorr, you are early.' &nbsp; While I was idling, a girl tapped my shoulders from my back.Although I was already mentally prepared for anything that's going to appear in front of me, I was still astonished by this girl who stood in front of me now.If not for the coffee theme and that 'Slorr', I would think she is only asking for directions. She is one of those 'chio bu' that can only be found on Orchard Road, which I usually see while crossing the road. Maybe I suffered from a serious concussion due to the heavy blow, my mind was extraordinarily calm. &nbsp; 'Had your dinner right? I think we shall go inside the Mac first.' &nbsp; 'You are pretty smart huh? A good way to save money indeed.' &nbsp; AIYA! She knows me so well, I can only give her an innocent smile back.Since she's so pretty, I ordered 2 LARGE cokes, and even ordered TWO packets of fries. &nbsp; 'This time you treat, next time I'll let you treat.' &nbsp; I am not falling for that, miss. But I am glad she mentioned 'next time'. &nbsp; 'Slorr, are you disappointed when you saw me just now?' &nbsp; DISSAPPOINTED? Are you drunk? &nbsp; 'Why do you think I will be disappointed then?' &nbsp; 'Cos I told you I am not cute mah, so you must be quite dissappointed when you saw me' &nbsp; She is making zero-sense, but I know she is just trying to hint that she's actually cute.' &nbsp; Then why did you have to lie that you are not cute?' &nbsp; 'Slorr. I said I am not cute. I didn't say I am not pretty.' &nbsp; *$%$**%^*&amp;%$@!!! &nbsp; 'But you are also quite decent looking what it's not like what you described to me too.''DECENT'? A very vague word. To many gals, decent=boring. One good thing is that she didn't lie to me about the fact that she is keeping long hair. She also has a fair complexion which reminds me of HL milk I take almost everyday. &nbsp; It is now only that I found out she is from ACJC, but had spent her first 3 mths in AJ.Sitting in front of each other, we talk about many things. From her obsession with coffee to my hobby of watching movies. BTW, she had completely shook off my misconception of 'if she is pretty, she is brainless'. She appears to be an attractive girl, both physically and character wise, talking, smiling to me, occasionally being a little sarcastic and nasty.It's like a dream. &nbsp; We left the Mac at around 10 pm. Since it's still early, I decided to send her home and fortunately, it's just Ang Mo Kio, two MRT stops from mine. &nbsp; I would have second thoughts if she's staying at Pasir Ris. &nbsp; 'Slorr, congratulations! You are officially permitted to date me from now on.' &nbsp; She said this before the lift door closed. &nbsp; Back at home, I realized that I hadn't asked for her real name, maybe it's the influence of that stupid Tye.Tye told me :Never ask a pretty girl her name the first time you meet her, cos there are already too many wolves out there dying to know, so she will be more interested in you if you act bochap.  Then why didn't she ask for mine? Don't tell me there's a female version of Tye telling her not to? &nbsp; It's again 1 am. Time to meet her in ajcrr. &nbsp; 'Hi! Slorr you tired?' &nbsp; Of course I am tired after all the surprises she presented me, I would go straight for my bed if not for her. But why is she here also?.Isn't she tired too? &nbsp; 'Long time no see how are you?' &nbsp; 'Slorr you siao ah? 2 hours only leh... miss me?' &nbsp; 'A)Yes B)Of Course C)Abuden D)Dying to see you E)All of above. Answer is E.' &nbsp; ' ' &nbsp; Seems like she is really tired, even the smiling face are yawning to me right now &nbsp; .'You wanna go for a movie tomorrow?' &nbsp; Maybe I should ask her now, while she is half asleep, hoping that she will blur-blurly click 'OK'. &nbsp; 'Should be no problem. What show?.'HOOOOORAY!!. I am cheering for her fatigue. &nbsp; 'We decide what show tomorrow. Anyway what's important is watch with who. Not the show.' &nbsp; Tye's favourite line, I am just borrowing it. &nbsp; ' ' &nbsp; 'You should go sleep now lah.' &nbsp; 'Wait one little while. You haven't tell me you tired or not?' &nbsp; 'Ok lah, A bit. You leh?' &nbsp; 'I am exhausted but have to say good night to you first. Slorr, if not I can't sleep.' &nbsp; 'me too.' &nbsp; I can't believe I am doing this SILLY business right now. &nbsp; 'Ok I tell you what I count 1,2,3. Then we log off together.' &nbsp; 'ok good night Slorr.' &nbsp; 'Same to you' &nbsp; '1...' &nbsp; '2...' &nbsp; '3...' &nbsp; I never talk whenever I am inside a cinema, and now is the best time for my mouth to rest, so I spent the following 3 hours to admire this much-talked-about movie of the century, Titanic.I am not a romantic person, so it's perfectly understandable if I can't really appreciate this motion picture fully, except for all those stunning special effects. &nbsp; But something struck me when Jack said to Rose before he sank into the deep.....'Rose, listen to me... listen.... winning that ticket was the best thing that had happened to me... it brought me to you....and I am thankful, Rose....I am thankful.... &nbsp; 'Suddenly I felt much fortunate than Jack, because I don't have to risk my life to board Titanic, all I have to do is to switch on my PC every night.But he's one lucky guy too, because he knows how to draw, and just look at how slowly he was drawing Rose, that made me blame myself for the lack of this talent.  &nbsp; But to her, this movie wasn't just about drawings or special effects. I noticed that packet of tissue paper she was holding in her hand. and just when Rose said: 'I promise... I will never let go, Jack... i'll never let go..'She opened up her sling bag and here comes the reserve handkerchief. Damn that Celine Dion, why on earth did she had to sing that 'MY HEART WILL GO ON' at the end of the show, for all the female species inside the theater, its like 'MY TEARS WILL ALSO GO ON'. &nbsp; 'Ok, movie ended. Let's go.' &nbsp; I stood up, speak to her gently, worried that every single word I breathe out might just crush onto her, and kill her. she continued to sit on the position, looked at me with her beautiful eyes that just came back from a swim. &nbsp; After a while, she said 'Slorr, movie ended, but life goes on. Am I right? &nbsp; 'I nodded my head. But I just wished somebody might give me some clue of what she was saying. Finally we managed to leave Orchard cineplex, since its still early, we decided to take a walk down the street. &nbsp; Along the way, she seems unusually quiet. So I guess Tye was right about the 'TITANIC FLU', he said that gals often got so mentally distressed after watching this show, and it's the best time to launch an emotional attack on her, that's why Tye had watch Titanic for over 5 times roughly. &nbsp; Her eyes were focussed on the path or the crowds but I know her mind was still left on Titanic, sinking with her, waiting for somebody to pull her up.I just kept my mouth shut. I know I am not a good swimmer. &nbsp; &nbsp;We walked to Plaza Singapura. Suddenly she stopped in front of a Christian Dior counter. &nbsp; &nbsp; 'Slorr, have you read a novel called 'Fragrance'?' &nbsp; 'Err..nope. Why do you ask?' &nbsp; 'Look at this 'DOLCE VITA' from Christian Dior. It's what the guy bought for her girlfriend in the story on her birthday. And he told her 'DOLCE VITA' is French, meaning 'SWEET TIMES'' &nbsp; She pointed to a bottle of perfume at the counter, but I was more interested at the price tag around the neck of the bottle. &nbsp; 'Oh... is it?' &nbsp; 'Slorr, then do you consider today as 'sweet times'?' &nbsp; 'At first I do, but some points are deducted since you started crying.' &nbsp; 'That means it can only be considered a little bit sweet, I'll buy the small bottle then.' &nbsp; I insisted to pay for the perfume as her birthday present from me since I know her birthday is coming soon, this kind of saves me a lot of trouble of finding a present for her. Luckily it's just perfume, or I would have to pawn my underwear if that guy in the story gives her girlfriend diamond or gold bar. &nbsp; 'Are you hungry? Wanna sit down and have something?' &nbsp; 'I don't have appetite, what about you?' &nbsp; 'You eat, I eat...' &nbsp; Her eyes are red again. I am such a fool. Finally got away from the noisy crowd at the MRT station, walking on one of the steets of AMK Ave 6. Contrastingly, it's so quiet now that I even can hear the rhythm of her heartbeat.' &nbsp; 'Slorr, do you know what's the correct way of applying perfume?' &nbsp; I shook my head. In fact, I had never used a perfume or cologne before, medicated oil maybe. &nbsp; 'First you apply some behind your ears, then your neck and wrists. After that spray some onto the air, then walk through it.' &nbsp; 'Sure or not?' &nbsp; 'In that case this little bottle won't even be able to last you for 3 days' &nbsp; 'Slorr, shall we try?' &nbsp; 'We? You go ahead. I am a MAN.' &nbsp; She opened up that DOLCE VITA, behind her ears, neck then the wrist she applied some and she really did spray some onto the air!!WABIANGZ!! Expensive leh! Finally she stretched out her hands, facing up like enjoying the raindrops fallling on her face. &nbsp; 'Hahaha....' &nbsp; 'Slorr, this is so fun! Now its your turn.' &nbsp; She went through the same procedures with me and I can feel the coldness of her fingers. maybe it's the perfume, I guess. &nbsp; 'Slorr, get ready, I am going to spray!!' &nbsp; I imitated her. Face up and walked through my first perfume rain. &nbsp; 'Slorr let's have another round!!'   -=~@~=- &nbsp; Finally its 12 pm, excited as I was, logged on the net, yet there was still no sign of FlyNDance. &nbsp; ' WHAT!!' &nbsp; She isn't there, my heart was beating fast. But the temperature remained below healthy level....   But there's a mail from her : &nbsp; Dear slorr, &nbsp; At first I thought it will be easier for me to settle down in the darkness... recollecting memories we have shared... but all I felt was loneliness...... can you feel it too?... &nbsp; I still can't change the habit of logging on at 1am... so I used a different nick to sneak into AJCRR... you don't blame me right?......  &nbsp; you werent there... should I feel glad for your obedience?.... you said both of us belonged to TYPE 2... the foolish type...maybe you are right!... 'cos I really do admire those who dares to fight for their desires...  &nbsp; I stroke my hair gently when you said that I am leaving the world... and a few strands of hair fell..... No!... doctor told me its not a terminal disease... and doctor aren't supposed to lie!!?... I still can live like a normal person... BUT CAN I?.. &nbsp; FlyNDance... is it really something I wont be able to do?... After the first meeting with you at Mac... I started to realise that you are not only a virtual being living in the cyberspace... in reality you are strong, gentle and sensitive.... I can feel the defense Wall of my heart is slowly breaking apart.... I am defeated...  &nbsp; I tied my hair today.. 'cos my fren told me that I look more attractive this way...I want you to remember my face as it is today... 'cos after today... everything may change.... But why didn't you ask for my real name? ..thats why I never asked for urs... &nbsp; I am a girl mah..... do you realised how I wish to have something more than a nick to take along with me? ...Slorr... thank you for the DOLCE VITA... finally got a taste of what sweet times are like... but I am really sorry..... I just couldnt bear to say goodbyz..... &nbsp; since it started from a mail.... it should end with a mail too.... Its been 3 months and 2 days since the very first mail... not a very long time but it isn't short either.... our story began from me... and I will end it..   Maybe its what you said... 'internet is fast and convenient, but it isn't perfect'.... I can send you my thoughts right away... but not my tears... Its about 5.30am now.... time to go.... by the time you receive this mail... I would be trying to settle down somewhere else.... I don't know....Good Bye.With  &nbsp; lotsa love, FlyNDance  &nbsp;  After reading her mail, I felt as if I had just experienced a roller-coaster ride which almost derailed. she had shown me the other side of her, soft and sensitive. &nbsp; Suddenly I felt cold and shaky. And that coolness seemed to have come straight from my heart, the rate of my heartbeat was an exponential function of time as it got closer to 1 am. &nbsp; USE A DIFFERENT NICK!! &nbsp; checked .. &nbsp; She isn't there, my heart was beating fast. But the temperature remained below healthy level....  &nbsp; For a couple of months, I was trying to hypnotise myself, to suppress my feelings whenever I started to think about her again. Perpetually I was telling myself, she is just one virtual character that flys and dance in the net, but never in the real world.I became a fugitive, escaping from my PC, escaping from the internet and anythng that has to do wih coffee.  &nbsp; Hide myself behind the piles of lecture notes, behind the crowd of people, trying to get rid of this thought of missing something in life. &nbsp; But I failed. I found out that its not that I don't miss her, its just that I had forgotten the passion that always comes along when you are having something hanging on your mind all the time. its like I cannot not breathe, its just that I had forgotten the fact that I have been breathing in and out for the past 19 years.I can hold my breath for a while, but not forever.I have to find her.  &nbsp;  'Err... I am looking for ... er..FlyNDance....''HUH??...' &nbsp; 'Huh', this is the exact word I was expecting from her.She seems to be FlyNDance's elder sister, 20++, looked quite a beauty too even without any makeup. But of course, still can't be compared with her. I explained to her my purpose for knocking on the door and told her that I am no stalker whom she might think I am. &nbsp; Surprisingly when I told her my disgusting nick, Slorr, she appeared to be rather excited and quickly she scribbled something on a small piece of paper and handed it to me. &nbsp; 'You should go and see her. SGH, Room 3-425.' &nbsp; -=~@~=- &nbsp; This is the first time I've ever stepped into the Singapore General Hospital. It's a dust-free space, everything looked so clean, tidy and arranged. &nbsp; But I don't like the feeling it gave me... I entered room 3-425, she was there, in a deep sleep.  &nbsp; I stood by her, watching.Her hair was still as long as before, laying across the soft, white pillow...Her face looked roundish now, I know it's the side-effect of the medicine. And the pinkish-red patch that was on her neck had spread to her face appearing in a shape of a butterfly.Nevertheless, she was still the most beautiful butterfly I've ever seen. &nbsp; Her eyelashes twitched slightly, she must be dreaming, what's that in her dream?McDonald's fries and coke? Sinking Titanic? Or the rain at AMK Ave 6?  &nbsp; The room was getting darker as the clock approaches 6pm.I wanted to switch on the light. I hate to see her lying lonely under the shadow of a patient's room.But I am worried that her dreams might be disturbed by the sudden light rays.  &nbsp; While I was in a dilemma, her eyes opened slowly. Her eyes were wide on me, then she turned away suddenly.I can only see her back at this moment. She lost weight. After a long time, she turned to face me again, rubbed her eyes and smiled.... &nbsp; 'Slorr, you are here!''Yes, nice weather today, isn't it?' &nbsp; 'Ya lor, sky also very chio (hokien for beautiful) today? Right? Heehee..' &nbsp; SKY VERY CHIO...I can still remember this was the conversation we had in one of our AJCRR meetings. &nbsp; 'But she didn't realized that it's raining today. &nbsp; 'Slorr, why are you standing there. Sit down.'Thanks for reminding me. I just found out that my legs were numbed due to the several hours of standing. &nbsp; 'Slorr, you lost weight.' &nbsp; ME? I thought I should be the one who's telling this to her!? &nbsp; 'Slorr, you hungry? Had your lunch? Food here isn't so good. That's why patients like me always slim down a bit. Apart from that. It's quite ok. But sometimes I feel really bored without a PC here to talk to you..' &nbsp; 'Slorr, how's your mid-year? Sure did very well right?' &nbsp; WAIT A MINUTE! You are the one who's lying on bed right now not me! Yet, I had nothing to ask her actually.Because I was there to see her, not to find out the answers to those questions. &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe now its the time for me to utter some touching lines like whats in the case of a movie.But I am not a Romantic person... moreover...Movies are fiction.Life isn't. &nbsp; -=~@~=-  &nbsp; I just wished that she could leave this place as soon as possible back to AMK Ave 6, back to ACJC, back to where she belonged.  &nbsp; And I promised she won't be alone anymore, because I will always be there. &nbsp; After a while, her mum was here to see her.&nbsp;Around the age of 50, slightly overweight. Other than the cheerful smile, she didn't really remind me of FlyNDance. &nbsp; 'Err, I think i've gotta go now. Bye bye auntie.' &nbsp; 'You....You...' She sat up straight in a sudden, like if she'd experienced a tremendous shock. &nbsp; 'I'll be here again tomorrow.. and the day after tomorrow... until you leave this place...' &nbsp; Before I went back home, I went to Plaza Singapura again to buy that Christian Dior Dolce Vita... and I've got the biggest bottle this time, that she can even swim in it.I try not to close my eyes that night, I want to go to her as soon",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3762044,indUnk,"                 It's an inauspicious time to start a blog.   My 26th birthday nears (no signs of lover, hubby in the offing), my best friend harps on the 'off-blog' nature of our convos (as if  her  sexual activity were the point of this!), and I just wasted several prime-REM sleep hours crafting yet another profile (gulp) for the beta version for  urlLink Soulmatch  — the ecumenical answer to  urlLink eHarmony  (imagine a UN for religions, with some Yenta at the head).  Worst of all, I can't even decide how to organize my material, of which there is much. Do I proceed in chronological fashion? (Much delay will ensue, given  my obsessive quest for 'historical' accuracy.) Or do I introduce the men in a by-the-by fashion — as if telling stories to a new friend? I lean increasingly toward the latter, but have decided to put it first to a vote among you, dear readers.  (Yes, there will be occasional lapses into  urlLink Victorian  tones ... but have no fear. There's lotsa masturbating and  urlLink chocolate genitals  yet to come -- none of it even mine!)      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3761156,indUnk,"           Well today I cleaned house for a while. And then Laura invited my sisters and I to go to Fairfax pool because her Spanish friend Marta was exiling her. But we couldn't leave until a parental got home, which is dumb. So we didn't get there until Laura and Marta were leaving! What's the point? I'll tell you what the point is! To stay there for 4 hours, hang out with Erin Loree, work on my approach with lifeguard/madrigal and former diver Mandy A., and to help my sister build up the courage to go down the slide and swim by herself in the   deep water!   Overall, I'd say it was quite the fun time. But I've had way more than my fair share of chlorine today, and Lauren will be at diving tomorrow! Yey! So I should probably hit the sack. That was short, and not too sweet either. John is moving to Israel???? Or France . . . Or Germany . . . oh whatever, the kid can't hold on to a thought for more than year anyway.

3755653,indUnk,"       Especially when it's headed up by the wife of the candidate.  Not only did Teresa Heinz Kerry heckle back (in light blue tone as well) at a protester yesterday, but John Kerry today accused the president of having squandered a booming economy.     Mrs. Kerry's outburst, full of hate and fear-mongering, is cited in AP's story  urlLink Heinz Kerry: Three More Months for Bush .  While Bush supporters were chanting 'Four More Years' she quipped, 'They want four more years of hell.'  Yes, she's outspoken.  Yes, hecklers deserve a dose of their own medicine.  But to call the past four years hell and make people believe they have four years of their personal ring of the Inferno to inhabit is definitely not in the spirit of constructive debate to which the Democratic Party challenged the Republicans just a few short days ago.    In that same vein, Kerry today said Bush tanked the economy, as cited in  Reuters  story  urlLink Kerry Accuses Bush of Squandering Robust Economy .  First, clearly the Democrats are forgetting that the downturn in the economy is charted as having begun in early 2000, not after the elections in November or the inauguration in January of 2001.  It happened on Clinton's watch as the DotCom bubble burst.    As well, he's bringing up changing the law of the land so that the president himself can veto spending lines of the budget.  Hmmm...  Line Item Veto for the president.  Sounds familiar...  Oh, that's right.  Clinton tried it and was denied by the SCOTUS.  Bush started talk about it this year, and his aides now say they've come to a solution that they think will pass muster with the Courts.  At least you can't say Kerry flip-flopped there -- He voted for the Line Item Veto in 1996.  He's just stealing Bush's work towards passage, mostly because you haven't heard much about it in the news.

While I can replace neither the time nor energy you were forced to expend due to my behavior that day, I do hope you will accept my apology for the trauma I caused you by asking you to reprint those job listings that had the phone numbers cut off.   A public service job requires one to be patient and accommodating to patrons, but now I realize that I, too, am charged with the responsibility of being understanding when you believe circumstances are out of your control.  In addition I would like to apologize for questioning your competency and becoming agitated when your responses were not to my satisfaction.  While patience has never been one of my strongest suites, this hellish  experience at the hands of your comrades at the Wilmington PD will remind me to make a more concerted effort to do so in the future.  Again, I extend my sincerest apologies for violating your policies, as well as the interruption in your demanding work responsibilities at the library.   I appreciate your consideration and hope you will find it somewhere in your hearts to forgive me when you feel ready.

A mixture between jazz, electronica and some beats.  The day was crazy though, a heat together with drinking for many many hours... and a lot of photos made.

3734929,Consulting,"            What are micro-enterprises?  Micro-enterprises by definition are very small businesses. These are generally started by low-and moderate-income individuals for the purpose of creating their own job or extra income for themselves and their families. The characteristic feature of successful micro-enterprises is that they utilize local resources and skill sets to produce goods and services that generally cater to the local demand but depending upon the availability of distribution channels may even go to distant markets.    What is micro-enterprise development?  Micro-enterprise development is a process of providing services to micro-businesses to help them grow quickly at a reduced risk. These services include business training, technical assistance to create a business plan, microfinance, technological and marketing support.   What kind of service-support micro-enterprises require?  Micro-enterprises need service support in the following areas:  •Resource mapping to identify locally available raw materials, skill sets and technology. Micro-entrepreneurs, often, have a set of skills that pass from one generation to the other. These skills evolve over time to meet the requirements of the local market. However, to remain competitive they need to identify optimal sources of raw materials and continuously upgrade skill sets and technology,  •Market Research to help determine the nature  and distribution of demand for the product,  •Functional training in areas of finance and accounts, supply chain management and marketing,  •Business planning and financial modeling enabling the entrepreneur to develop the right business mix and a set of best business processes and practices,  •Business audit to ensure that best practices continue within the enterprise giving it  a better chance of attaining sustainability,  •Finance – working capital loans, longer tem loans based on organizational requirements. Microneterprises also need support in linking with the providers of finance as banks and formal financial institutions need detailed project proposals. For small investment requirements, Micro Finance Institutions represent an easy and more accessible source of funds.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3722851,indUnk,"       I don't know why I look forward to Friday so much. It doesn't mean I have a few days off. I am off everyday. Well, unless you take in consideration my duties of being a Domestic Engineer. Those duties keep me busy during the week for say, 2 hours, if that. I get to sleep in most days. My children are all old enough to take care of themselves. They are 12, 17 and 21. I also have a grandson who is 3.   I woke up this morning excited to go visit with my friend Amy. She been sick for a long time. We sit and watch TV, drink lattes, talk and laugh. It is always a highlight of my day to spend time with her. Some days we drive all over town for DR appointments, shopping and lunch. The lunch part is the hardest for Amy because she can't eat real food very well. She's a trooper though. She tries every time to eat. We feel it is a triumph if she can get more than 3 bites down!  Back to Friday. I think the biggest thing about it being Friday is my husband will be home for two days straight. Some times we go for a motorcycle ride. We find the back roads and take off for several hours of peace. I sit on the back and close my eyes and think. I think so peacefully, disregarding the noise coming from the motorcycle's engine and the air blowing across my helmet. It is the most peaceful time I can think of for me. I think about everything. My kids, my home, my friends and of course, I think about myself. It is a time to reflect on who I am and what I am doing with my life. There's nothing like it. I come home exhausted. not only from the heat and wind but from thinking so much. Who would have thought thinking could wear a person out?  This weekend there probably won't be a motorcycle ride. We have a lot of packing to do to go on our vacation. We leave next Friday for Florida. This trip is going to be stressful for me for a few reasons. I would have to go into detail to explain it all. I will do that when we get back. I would hate to project bad feelings or events before they happen. This next week of preparation will get to me as it is. I am sure I will share with you the happenings of preparing for a vacation to Florida.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3721722,Student,"                 WOW.  Haven't been here in a few weeks.  Thanks for the comments guys :)  I apologize for lack of updates, but I seem to have fallen for someone.  HE'S ASIAN.  And he's really hot.  My gosh...don't think I just like because of that.  He's been in my German class for the last two years and I didn't really notice him before.  He moved here from Japan before freshman year and learned English in about 8 months.  Pretty sweeet huh?  Haha, well He and I didn't become good friends until a few months ago, just before school ended.  He then asked me out but, being the uptight, prude-ish, can-never-be-too-careful girl that I am, said no.  That WHOLE day, all of his friends kept coming up to me and saying how 'heartbroken' he was.  Of course I felt bad, but I hardly knew the guy...who could blame me?  I like to be careful with the guys I go out with.  I don't like having 1 week relationships and having them end with verbal fights throughout the whole next year.  I made the mistake of going out with the same guy for 11 months.  Before then, we were best friends.  But now?  HAH.  I'm not even gonna go there right now.....  So anyways, Alex [sorry if I forgot to mention his name earlier] and I have become really good friends during the past few months.  He invited to me to go to Japan with him for a week or two because he visits his family every summer.  My parents were going to let me because they thought it would be a great 'cultural' experience.  But since I'm going to Alask in August, I had to renew my passport, which means that I won't get it until August 1st.  How gay is that haha.  But Alex and I have been talking so much.  It's weird...I haven't been able to talk to him [face to face] in over a month, but I like him even more than I did before I left.  I get butterflies everytime I think about him.  He's the sweetest guy I've ever met.  But a girl can't be too careful, right?  I hope so.....      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3714472,Arts,"       I'd like to give Vaclav Havel a big kiss:  Absurdity is the experience that something that has, should or could have aspired to meaning---that is, something intrinsically human---does not do so at all, or else has lost it. It is, therefore, the experience of losing touch with Being, the experience of a disintegration of the power to confer meaning, the experience of a humanity that has discovered it has defrauded itself.... The moon is not absurd. What is absurd is the junkyard man has left on it.*  Only a saint could turn machinations into a vehicle of change. Only a saint could turn emptiness & darkness into light.  I suppose it's been done, but not so well & so vocally by a former world figure. He bears all the marks of honesty: imprisonment, unabashed epicureanism, gushing.  Perhaps it's time (or past time) for a pilgrimage to Katernia, the village my grandmother's family was from. It's in Bohemia, near Prague.  I'd like to think it looks something like central Pennsylvania, what I remember of it, towards Philadelphia, on highways past fields & starkness.   * from  Letters to Olga   The finished 4th draft (I try to do 4 quick drafts at once), begun & finished over days, which usually doesn't happen! Traveling cuts the mind in half, in a good way, I hope.  Conservativism notwithstanding,   I’ve been practicing your flute with the dogs. The low howling whirrs in the clicks a little.   Mary polishes the inside of a dying cup. The high moon spins.  My first priority is sleep.  Not noetic: the myrrh-bleeding stub  of elbow socket, sprouting the aesthetic  wing-stem. Let me generate the chord charts for    your part. Some Republican says  luxury is worth it on the  parallel bridges.   I can smell you jutting out from broken  wave to bent pole. Loamlike & cresting, what’s your final answer to the road’s caves?  The inaudible rattling, the blowing of air through pipes. One homophony: groaning, a deaf man’s sight: the motion of the blooming.   Not wind and breath alone, but more of the tattooed  tree. It echoes. The gale forces  itself through the nostrils & over the broken shield.  Mary strokes the inside of   her lover’s leg, rubbing off the  thin shrived hairs.   The sly moon cringes. What  do you base yourself on? Not  less than slipping out of monsoon edges,   the martyric hum & liftings.  A section from Diane Ackerman's amazing book,  Natural History of the Senses , mentioned many times here & already reminding me of the beach:  A dolphin has a brain as complex as our own; it has language, culture, and emotions. It has its own society, with codes of conduct, family groups, and a civilization, but it lives in a world on 'our' planet, as we like to say with chauvinistic bravado, unimaginably different from our own. We may have much to learn from it. Deep down, we know our marriage to reality is just a marriage of convenience, and we leave it to the seers, the shamans, the ascetics, the religious teachers, the artists among us to reach a higher state of awareness.... It began in mystery, and it will end in mystery.      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3707001,Student,"       It turns out that I was sadly mistaken... I actually did not know the answer, nor will I know for a while.  So what I thought was the end was really the middle... possibly a very long middle... but one I'm happy is there.  But before I found this out, I decided that I wasn't about to let this get me down.  If I turned around and ran everytime conflict arises, what kinda person would I be?  Luckily, I did go on msn last night, and I did sort things out.  Right when the storm was kicking up again, the person who left me in the lake came back with a life saver, almost losing us both in the struggle.  Don't get me wrong.  I still am a ghost, I still go unnoticed.  I am still that drifter who hasn't found a place in life.  But now I do have a meaning, a purpose.  I again have something truly worth fighting for.  My goal in life?  To make something of myself so that when that day comes I will be ready.  Forever... I seem to be using that word alot lately.  But now I truly mean it, not that I didn't before.  It still feels as tho forever will happen.  But now I can wait for forever happily cuz I got something to look forward to:  another's happiness.  No matter what happens, just promise me that you will be happy...  To my friends: Last post I pretty much gave y'all the cold shoulder before u even talked to me.  Im sorry.  I can't say I was lying cuz I wasn't, at that moment I wanted to be alone.  And I was alone, maybe not as long as I expected, but I was.  My trust in myself, my faith in my abilites... is slowly returning.  It was lost when I started questioning myself, but that has stopped.  Why?  I'm not sure... cuz I reached a resolution I'm happy with I guess, and that has restored my faith in myself.  But when I say that I don't wanna talk to my friends, I mean that I don't wanna talk about IT... I'm always here to talk if u want to talk about something.  To my great friend: I truly do mean it when I call u a great friend.  You where there when I needed to vent... even offered yourself as a punching bag.  Tho it may not seem that way at the time, your insignificant actions can mean the world to someone.  And your's are no exception.  I truly thank you for being there.  To the source of my anger/frustration/confusion/depression/sadness/but-most-importantly-happiness (yes... 100xhappiness :D): I was not lying when I mentioned all those emotions.  Yesterday I felt the most extreme emotions ever: from anger to regret to depression... more depression... then relief and finally happiness.  But thx to you no matter what has happened I will from now on me a stronger person.  So I dedicate this song to you:  Good Man - RL   'You could catch me in the Gentlemen’s club Substitutin’ lap dances just for love, love, love goin’ home to an empty house Thinkin’ who should I call for some fun, hey   I never knew love until you, love Never thought that I’d fall in love Till you brought out of me The man I always knew I could be, baby    I can count the lovers that I’ve had                 [Hook]  And all of those relationships gone bad I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love I was just a boy and not a man Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you and what you do You made me a good man, oh, baby   Used to change my numbers every other week Gettin’ crazy crank calls from them freaks i'd meet  In V.I.P with a bottle of somethin’ Tryin’ hard to push on some heat  ‘Cause I-I never knew love until you, love You showed me a true love You gave me the chance Now I understand how to be a good man, oh, yes   I can count the lovers that I’ve had (I’ve had)      [Hook]  All of those relationships gone bad (Relationships) I wanna thank you for guiding me And showing me love (The love, yes) I was just a boy and not a man (Not a man, no) Falling deep in love was not the plan Baby, because of you (You, you, you) and what you do You made me a good man    Thank you for lovin’ me  (Where is the love that you promised to love and When was the love that we share, where is your love, oh, yeah)  But if it ain't you, my love’s for nobody  (Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody) (Oh...oh...oh...oh...oh...)

And something about the smell of bonfire and rain and stale beer in my clothes makes something inside me smile. All these crazy teenage moments something that I will forever hold on to. Especially when I finally sleep on a Monday night and the smell of stale beer is no longer something I'm accustomed to. A Tuesday morning hello is something I will always have from you. And that early morning sun laced with fireflies and the scent of dew and cigarettes Those tiny stars still glowing like they have something to prove. And when I think of our talks and how I can lose myself in those portals to your soul And there is just something about how you hold yourself and the way your face seems to change when looking at me I really have no words to say. I can barely keep my eyes open, but somehow your head against my chest keeps me from falling asleep. Listen to my heartbeat, I'll hold you while you sleep, the fireflies will dance and I will watch your mouth fill your lungs with life's breath Hoping that a part of me is in your fragile lungs Sleep softly, and on Tuesday morning it will be hello Something for me to give to you that may seem like nothing but will mean everything to me watch that sleepy sun cast away the darkness, glowing blue on everyone around us sleeping soundly Beer and cigarettes, pointless jokes and teenage party politics, endless talks and a beautiful sunrise, it is now Tuesday morning, hello.  this is something, someone wrote.

Second, roommate Steve is transferring his computer along with our Internet hardware over to his fiance's apartment.  So with that I enter the void.  I don't know how much Internet access I will have over the next weeks.  If at all, I imagine it would be of the dial-up variety, so no more downloads for me.

3699514,InvestmentBanking,"                 The traffic going to and from San Diego is just getting so ridiculous. We left the OC today at 1:30pm and didn't arrive in downtown S.D. until 3:45pm. That's a trip that normally takes a little over an hour from where I live in Irvine. The 5 freeway is just plain jam packed with too many cars. If they're going to approve all the new housing being built,they might want to think of the impact that it is going to have on congestion. What sucks is that you'd think on a weekend that there would be no traffic, but you would be dead wrong on that assumption. As I was listening to the traffic report on the radio, it was nice to hear that we weren't the only ones suffering. There's too many freakin'people in Southern California for the current roads to handle. I'd be nice if our tax dollars could go towards widening and building new roads, but I guess I won't hold my breath. Here would be my platform if I ever ran for office: #1 would be to widen and build more roads, round up all the illegal immigrants and deport them back home wherever that might be, don't raise any taxes & cut spending across the board to get to balance, and abolish speed limits on the highways. I guess you could boil it down to a platform of 'quality of life' issues. Sure there are other things to do, but those would be the things I would concentrate on.      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I wanna walk with him, and have him hold my hand, and be happy. I wanna be happy. I wanna light up when i see his name on the caller id just to sit and talk to him for hours about nothing. I wanna be able to have some where to go, and always have somthing to do. I wanna fight with him just to make up seconds later. I wanna be able to make him a promise and no i wont break it. I wanna have nothing, but feel like i have everything. I wanna get a phone call from him just becasue he wanted to tell me he was thikning about me and that he loved me. I wanna dream about him and wake up and have him tell me he drempt about me. I wanna no he fells the same way. I dont wanna care what everyone else thinks. I dont wanna have to question what i feel for him. I dont wanna cry my self to sleep. I dont wanna hurt him. I dont wanna be hurt. I dont wanna be afraid of what tomorrows ganna bring.

Some people may not show it but we all want it, we all need it. Its what makes the world go round. But i guess, the only thing i can do is wait, just sit and wait. Wait for ones to come and go, wait for the day, that i realize, that ive found that person, and that im in love. I can count the minuts, i can count the hours, i can count the days, i can count the years, but it wont make it come any faster. So like i said, i guess ill just wait....      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3683204,indUnk,"       I'm on a mission.  I've decided to dedicate a good portion of my time and effort to protest against the C2 movement.  I wholeheartedly believe that it represents what is most seriously wrong about our culture: the commercials, the concept, the taste.  Everything is bad.  For those of you who regularly watch TV or listen to the radio, I'm sure you've heard a commercial or two about C2.  They play the oldie-but-goodie 'You Can't Always Get What You Want,' phrasing an unpleasant scenario in which you hypothetically must put yourself out to help out your best friend, your neighbor, your parents, your pets.  They float the entire campaign on the fact that C2 has half the calories and half the carbohydrates of regular Coca-Cola, and all the taste, so now you CAN get what you want -- guilt-free taste.  Look, ladies and gentlemen.  I've been against this Atkins craze since the beginning of its media frenzy.  There is absolutely nothing healthy about ketosis (the state of shock your body goes into when it is denied carbohydrates).  I fervently believe that this 'low-carb' craze is just selling Americans what they always think they want: effortless instant gratification.  If you want to lose weight, get off your lazy ass and exercise.  That's the only thing we're going to have to do as a culture in order to not be laughed at by other countries around the world.  We can't cut this and add that...we learned that with the low-fat diets.  Usually when you cut down on one thing, you add twice as much of another; Snackwell's has no fat, sure, but it's got tons of sugar.  Steak sauteed in butter and smothered in A1 has no carbs, sure, but do you want to know what it's doing to your aorta?  So I say this.  America, get over yourselves.  You can't biggie-size ANYTHING and expect to not pay for it in one way or another.  Fries will give you a heart attack eventually.  If you sue someone because you're too stupid to use your common sense, the entire economy suffers.  Small-town doctors are going out of business because they can't afford malpractice insurance, and before we know it we're going to sue ourselves out of affordable medical coverage.  The price of food is going up because everybody has to hire researchers to figure out exactly how some idiot in Buttfuckville could use said product to hurt themselves and sue for kajillions.  It's just not easy...so deal with it and move on.  As far as C2, I say to you...don't drink it.  It symbolizes all that's wrong with our culture and more.  Oh, and it tastes like ass.  I tried it.  Nasty, nasty shit.  You've been warned.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3668449,Banking,"       We’ve been smoking pot and coloring those black, felt maker designs from your childhood, the ones with all the hippie swirls and cascading butterflies and the sun and moon dancing merrily in the cosmos.  We’ve been doing that on a Monday.  I called in again, he works overnight tonight.  But now the munchies have attacked I’m covered with a  slick wet stickiness because we’ve been deterring the air conditioner for as long as possible.  These humid stubborn summers of flaking nostrils and frizzy hair, they’re long gone now, I can almost smell the ocean again.  I tried to make all my colors fade together, something legibly connected, but it’s just a Mardi Gras poster painted almost by number if not by name.  It’s near impossible to keep the bright psychedelic colors of the 60’s and 70’s from bleeding onto the white spaces of the paper.              It’s so hot here I’m impatient, I’m pushing against my skin, this wet paper clung to my entire body.  I’m pushing against my constant failure, my inability to be anything more than a brief afterthought of minor cunning, just a few more jokes and I’d be doing standup in seedy, smoky clubs called Ballroom Brawler or the Red Saloon.  I keep telling myself to do something, to go somewhere, to become born once again.  No, not jesus, me and jesus… Well, he left after I kissed his cheek.  He left when it got too serious, when my words weren’t just hollow affections beating from my heart.  He left and we’ve parted ways but I see his photography in the National Geographic at times.  Or the Riverfront Times, the transvestites offering massages in the last three pages.  The Wild Side or whatever that column is called.  No born again like I’ve been missing near the caves and caverns on the river.  I’ve been missing in action, the pod manifested in my bathwater as I dozed, the tubes invading my orifices like tubular cream snakes.  They’ve been masquerading as this machinery.              Suddenly I wake up and it’s 8:30 every day, every moment.  My entire life consists of 8:30 in the mornings.  This is my interim existence.  I wait and wait for the glitch to snap, the record to skip and right itself, but no, every moment is the beginning of a day that never goes anywhere.  So I resist, it’s small time mutiny, like petty shoplifting of revolutions.  I call into work and console myself with marijuana and Ben and Jerry’s half baked ice cream.  I console myself with hours of mindless television.  I console myself with the emphatic promise of tomorrow.  Tomorrow I will work out, tomorrow my face will smooth and retract from this swollen berry, tomorrow I will write the fourth chapter, tomorrow I will feel like a woman and I won’t push Mike away because pot infects me like paranoia cancer and I feed off the decay.  Tomorrow is like the trim of a soft cloud holding its cumulous bushels in the corner of my house and I stare constantly at its billowing cotton and I can feel the promise of tomorrow.  Something has to be better than this right here, right now.                  ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3667423,indUnk,"   Mortification of Sin for the Believer  Mr. Owen, whom I have just read regarding the mortification of sin in the believer, is so practicle, wise, and prudent with his application of our personal duty, as well as that which consists of a true Christian's constitution.  One of the most helpful means by which we mortify sin, though seemingly obvious it may not be, is to (1) look to the law of God in guilt, but also (2) look to the work of Christ in guilt.  Yes, the proper use of the law is to drive us to Christ in dispair, knowing that we are forsaken and without any hope.  Yet, the believer also looks to the Cross of Christ in shame and guilt.  The Christians fixates his heart on the grace, love, mercy, torment, and pain undergone by Christ on the cross.  This only brings more shame to one's choice of sin in light of it.  How can we behold such suffering on our behalf and so contritely sin before God?  That seems more horrible than the law in many ways.

Before I destroyed the evidence, I saved some gems from it, which I will unashamedly share with my faithful readers.   You can expect to see a few more postings from my high school and middle school writings.  As few of you may be aware, I was the lead singer and guitarist for a punk band called  Sweet Debris .  While we never played any shows as a punk rock band (all of our drummers were fired or quit), I still have some of my masterpieces saved through the notebook.  Today’s sample is my great hit, “ This Day .”  Enjoy. . .    'This Day'    Vs. 1  I tried to miss you, but you were gone too long.  I wanted to kiss you, but you were scared of what might be.  Holding you in my mind... closely... what'll never be.    Chorus  Break my mind.  Change my heart.  Tellin' me, it's all my fault.  Not a word  Can ever say  What you've done to me on this day.    Vs. 2  You're my apathy. You're everything I never cared for.  I tried to play your game, but you broke all the rules.  I showed you my love, and now I'm the fool.    Bridge  Breaking apart...at the seams.  Losing my heart...and my dreams.    I know what you’re thinking: why did John go into philosophy when I should have gone into professional music or creative writing?  Let’s just say I haven’t ruled it out yet.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3655935,Student,"       I’ve decided to do a segment on blog focusing on a cool Beatles’ album once a week.  After all these years, the Beatles will finally receive their due by being acknowledged on my blog.  Don’t worry, I’ll notify the press.  First, I would like to turn to their self-titled album, popularly known as the   urlLink White Album  .  This two disc (originally vinyl, now available on CD) album was composed in 1968 as a follow up to their creative and sophisticated work, Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.  Sgt. Pepper featured an extravagantly colored cover with equally elaborate musical pieces.  At the time, most critics believed the Beatles could not outdo this major production.  The genius of the White Album is that the Beatles made it a simple album comprised mostly of simple acoustic guitar tracks.  Rather than trying to surpass the grandeur of Sgt. Pepper, the Beatles displayed beauty through simple, basic songs.   Martha My Dear  is one of my favorite songs on the album.  The song is primarily carried by the piano and catchy, melodic vocals.  George Harrison sports one of his best compositions,  While My Guitar Gently Weeps , which shows his maturing abilities as a songwriter that would be more evident later in the Beatles and in his solo career.  Songs like  The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill ,  Piggies ,  Rocky Raccoon , and  Cry Baby Cry  have a narrative feel like country music.  These songs add an eclectic mix to the album, which leave first time listeners delightfully surprised at what could come next.  Paul McCartney contributes playful works like  Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da  and  Wild Honey Pie , which easily elicit smiles from Beatles’ patrons.  Paul’s well-known  Blackbird  appears on this album as well, which is a staple for all acoustic guitar players.  Ballads like  I Will  and  Julia  are perfect for those romantics in need of a fresh and simple exposition of love.  The album rocks out with  Everybody’s Got Something to Hide Except Me & My Monkey ,  Helter Skelter , and  Back in the U.S.S.R. .  In short, the White Album has something for everybody.  In one album, the Beatles capture in beautiful simplicity a broad range of genres.  Not only did the Beatles manage to produce successfully a good album after the wide success of Sgt. Pepper, but they truly made a fresh, innovative contribution to popular music itself.    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3655513,Student,"       Well, I am new to blogging, and let me tell you that a week in the real world goes by fast. It's been since last Friday since I have recorded my thoughts onto this page that no one reads.  This week has been one of ups and down. Got screwed over by my potential insurance company when applying for the auto insurance for the car I recently came into possession of. They quoted me one price, assuming I had taken a driver's training course as a teenager, which of course was the wrong assumption. Upon my attempt to seal the deal with the company, they realised the error of their ways and demanded more money from me in order for me to get insured. I can't afford to pay them more than what they were initially asking. Long story short is that I am poor, have no insurance, thus no plates, thus my car remains parked in the underground parking facility beneath my apartment.  On a happier note, it's time I did something important. Let me introduce the world to the woman I love. Her name is Jennifer (Jenny for short) Gay. Yes her last name is Gay. Insert joke here. I've known this young lady for near to 10 years as her father was the former pastor of the church I regularily attended growing up in Peterborough, Ontario. This lady has been a dear friend for about a year, and an intense friend that my heart beats for passion with since late January of this year (2004). Well, our blooming friendship has progressed to the point where I believe that she is the woman I am to marry. (This is not just some flight of fancy, but being a deeply religious man, I believe that this is divine revelation to me) So I love Jenny and she loves me. We want to marry each other and shall some day. However, as in any good relationship we have our ups and downs. So last night was a night that started as a down and moved to an up. I was upset about the insurance thing getting screwed up. She was moody and cranky cause I was across town housesitting (forgoing any social connection with her for the next few days) combined with (dare I say) a little PMS. We talked on the phone for long hours into the night, and the result was that we both lightened each other's loads. Jenny felt her fears of my actions representing apathy / or poor treatment towards her in our relationship slip away, and my day / night was brightened by the action of reaffirming my love to my love. I can easily say that God has His hand in our life, 'cause only he can facilitate communication like that.  So all is well in the land of Rooster and Jenny (although the Rooster continues to rave at all car insurance companies and brokers) and life moves on as always.  I resolve to blog more often, but also realize in all reality that it's a discipline that needs to be honed. So here's to hoping that I hone it sooner rather than later. At this point in time, it certainly makes no difference as no one reads this blog, but perhaps, just perhaps one day, someone will run their mouse through my archives and explore the inner workings of my mind. Now, as to the meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything......  Rooster    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3649109,indUnk,"             I compete in 3 days now! I am excited, I am in the best shape of my life and I think I should do well. Though at this point it really doesnt matter, the excitement is in the fact that you have done the best you can, if I don't win it is because I  don't deserve to. I feel pretty confident none the less, these guys are gonna have to be in pretty good shape to beat me, but if they are, they deserve to right? I have had carbs now (rice cakes and instant mashed potatoes)so I don't have the burning desire to kill anymore ;-). I had a great night, with my great girl. I am so lucky to have her. Guys, I tell ya... you lost... I won! I am still drinking a fuckload of coffee though because my energy is not back 100% yet, but I am not grouchy anymore. I get to eat in 9 minutes, and I like that fact, then I get to eat 60min after that... I like that more. Rice cakes arent so bad after all you have had is fucking chicken for 4 days. I gfot this cool Starbucks coffee cup last night, and this new coffee. I havent had the new coffee yet because the old stuff isnt done yet. Regardless I am excited. I actually pulled the cup out of the dishwasher about 4 min ago so that I could use it for the coffee I am having now (I used it this morning also). The funny part is... I have like 3298752874 other cups I could have used, my Mom thought that I was batty! Well, as you can see I am in a better mood today,I will find it interesting to look back in a couple of weeks and see how my moods changed from day to day. Mabye then I will have an Idea of what the Ex was talking about... but who cares about that! That is why she is the Ex! I do my drug test on friday, that is always fun. I know they keep mine because I spend a lot of time both on the scan test and the interview bashing idots that take drugs... that will be the subject of a rant one day... because they are fucking dumb! (Please comment on this if you are a drugie so that I can email you personaly and tell you how stupid you are!) Well, time to get food, and more glorious coffee!!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3648082,Automotive,"             As we begin to think about launching a flesh-and-blood Christian community with a weekly, real-live worship gathering, we need to visualize what that worship gathering will look like. From Dan Kimball's book,  Emerging Worship,  here are ten principles that are being followed in many 'emerging' churches around the country:    Emerging worship moves away from a spectator type of gathering.  Instead of emphasizing the production, the excellence and the way things are programmed, it emphasizes coming together to express our love for God and experience God's love for us. It's the opposite of putting on a 'show.'   There is an organic design to the worship gathering.  It's not a linear, boxed-in kind of&nbsp;design. Many elements are woven together throughout the meeting, people are given lots of different ways to participate.   A sacred space is created for the worship gathering.  The space where worship takes place is very important. Visual elements are taken seriously -- lots of art, creatively-rendered images and scriptures, video images, candles, darkness, crosses.    Emerging worship takes a multisensory approach to worship.  Traditional worship is focused on listening (to music, prayers and teaching). Emerging worship involves the other senses as well. Meals are frequently part of emerging worship. Musical styles depend on the local setting, and vary from place to place. Opportunities for artistic expression are provided for all during worship; prayer stations are set up where people can write prayers, journal, draw, etc.   Emerging worship values freedom of movement in worship.&nbsp; People aren't forced to remain stationary in their seats for the whole meeting, nor do they rush out the door when it's over.   Emerging worship has a different focal point.  Instead of focusing on the band or the teacher/preacher, the leaders are in the midst of the people (or on the sidelines). The speaking is shared as much as possible. Sometimes the band plays from the rear, rather than the front.   Emerging worship is seeing a revival of liturgy, ancient disciplines, Christian seasons, and Jewish roots.  Even hymns!   Emerging worship emphasizes prayer.  It provides numerous opportunites for the people to intercede for others and get on their needs to confess their sins.   Communion is a central part of emerging worship.    Emerging worship makes Jesus the centerpiece of worship.  The prayers, the symbols, the de-emphasis on preacher and music leader -- all seek to put the focus on Jesus.   These are just commonly-seen values, not 'the Ten Commandments.' Your reactions?          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3647926,Environment,"           I urge you to see Fahrenheit 911. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns. The book of this title written by Ray Bradbury is one of censorship. Michael Moore's latest movie I would say is one of the censoring of our very freedom. Power is Knowledge and often times the citizens of this country are powerless and the 'knowledge' is packaged for us.       There was an initial conflagration of anger and guilt that ravaged my mind after seeing the documentary last night. After leaving the theatre, during the drive home watching the post industrial scenery, half listening to what my friends were saying about the film, feeling the pull of gravity as we zoomed across the landscape in smooth vectors and sharp curves my outrage simmered into a blanket of empathic and calculating embers that fell across my body like fireworks.       Yes, the processing of these feelings was like a fireworks show. Loud thundering booms exploding, bright and distinct. Then slowly spidering across the sky of my body only to be followed up by the loud clap of another distinct emotion. Powerful. Violently raping the quiet peaceful sky with sound and light. When I closed the car door and entered the chilly night air my burning did not cease. It will simmer waiting to burn the very essence of injustice. As I heard the teapot whistle I thought, 'But how?' This is where my headache revolves. How? To what end? By myself our with many? Who will listen? Who will care? How do I destroy injustice in my own way? How do I reclaim the power of knowledge? I closed my eyes and fell asleep feeling unsure yet empowered.  See the movie. Vote in November. Buy the DVD. Make your friend watch it, your neighbors too. Talk, talk, talk. Network. Take a deep breath and dive in.  Ciao          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3642905,Arts,"       90 years ago all of the arts of the West – visual, literary, and aural - stood up and stared at the state of the world and declared that Man had gone mad.      At first admonishing the moral structure of the 20th Century and then declaring that the Modern, schizophrenic man had been born (following the path of Nietzsche and Freud), artists rejoiced in their ability to freshly depict the new mind of humanity.  Romanticism, at last, was finally swept away.  The new themes: War, construction, science & technology.  Politics.  Optics.  Architecture & design.  Destruction.      This was all fine and good until the middle of the century; it had, after all, been 40 years. It was time for a little introspection.  Artists turned their spectacles inward to study the subtle nuances of language and linguistics (following the path of the Vienna Positivists and the Parisian Scholars) in a new method of exploring and comprehending Man’s - now obviously a constant – state of alienation.     Conceptualism was born from this linguistic study, and the lens shifted from contemplating the relationship of culture and the individual into an attempt to define all that art could be, and comprehend, if possible, what art could not be.  The first proved difficult, the later somewhat impossible.   Artists began to read, and it was fashionable to read along with them, for failure for not having read ( something, anything ) presented the assuredness of not getting it; or, at least, of not being able to pontificate on the subtle references to such-and-such and so-and-so.  Artists stopped making stuff and began to show maps, studies, locked galleries….    For artists and their patrons all of this was good.  There was interaction, a faith in philosophy, a sense of shared adventure and an exploration into a world uncharted.   To boldly go…   At first, a few good wars to admonish, later a new modern man to explore.  And then a cold war that began to flicker in the background that provided ample light to paint by, and more than enough shadow to slide politically.    But how long could anyone listen to anybody express the nuances of linguistic exploration without any physical doing?  Art, after all, was as much about looking as thinking.  It was time to show the tangible by-products of all these thought-games.  The 80s came and with it a new state of hyper-doing was born.  The artist moved back into the studio, and began, lo and behold, to make things.  And in those 15 seconds, everything spiralled to a halt.  The artist, reclining in the studio, writing poetry, practicing that new dance step, editing the next novel, and painting pretty pictures, became an icon; a very wealthy, if not exactly a rich, icon.  Artists of every kind retreated to the gallery and the music hall and the publisher they once shunned; the agent and the collector were reborn, the critic re-ignited, and the audience was supposed to show up at openings on Thursday from 6 ‘til 8 for the wine and cheese party.  But, alas, the adoring fan of the arts had taken this moment to turn on CNN and watched a new war (the first on closed-circuit TV) and – while catching up on the re-runs - began to wonder how long  Cheers  really would air for.     90 years after this story began more than several turbine engines collided into steel and concrete.  Thank God for CNN this time, for every artist in the West declared that this moment was too close, too emotional, too personal, to even consider as subject matter.  Best to leave this one to the media.  The arts – all of them - failed with the finesse of a little boy beaten up behind the schoolyard bicycle-rack for his lunch money.  The artist retreated to a remote farmer’s field, surrounded by a small group of spectators and a few unsuspecting passers-by.    What is to be done?  The artist obviously dropped the ball.  No blaming the judge here – the finger-work was shoddy, no effort was made to present anything that even resembles a performance; nobody even bothered to tune-up.  Artists – all of them - placed last for good reason: they don’t even bother to show up.       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3636538,indUnk,"       THE SHOTS: So yesterday i call the travel docter to see what shots i need before i go to China.  She said i should've have done this 6 weeks ago (tough, i'm doing it now).  She also said i need 10 or so shots(that is a shitload of shots).  And then she said it was gonna cost 500 bux(that is a shitload of money).  So on Tuesday i'm going to get 500bux worth of shots.  The only thing that really worries me is the shots in the ass. Not good, not good at all.  That and the 500 bux bit, bcos really, it is a shitload when you're kinda broke.  It's not that i'm scared of needles or anything cos i'm not in small amounts, but 10 seems kind of excessive.  Also, one of the diseases has something to do with the inflamtion of the brain.  Nasty.   THE STARBUCKS EPISODE: Starbucks sucks.  It sucks ass.  I went to get a coffee today bcos i haven't had one in two weeks (the broke thing again) and quite frankly i deserved a coffee, asked for a double shot and just a lil milk.  The dude says, oh we can't do that bcos we make our coffee with lots of milk. (That's so bullshit, bcos if you have a machine you can do what you like dumbass) I say ok look, i really just want a strong coffee with a little milk.  He says ohhhhhhhhhhhh, i can do you an americano.  I say cool, whatever man, just so long as it's strong.  He asks if i'd like 3 shots, i say sure, 3 is good.  And then he makes my coffee and he seems pleased with himself when he hands it to me and says it's nearly full up to the top.  IT TASTED LIKE FUCKING SHIT.  *sigh*  It was kinda like flavoured water that looked vaguely like shitty coffee and smelt vaguely like shitty coffee and tasted very much like shitty coffee only worse(that is possible) It was so bad i didn't drink it and now i'm pissed at starbucks bcos not only did it taste like shit but the guy filled it so full that i spilt it in my car.  ARGH!!  So yeah, starbucks is evil and i don't like them.  How this has become the largest coffee chain in the world i do not know.  Some people have no taste.   I guess i should apologise here if you're a starbucks fan..(no Iffi, you will never get me in there again, sorry)... my deepest sympathy, i hope you see the light some day :p  Ok, enough starbucks hating.   I'm all ready for tomorrow night :) I can't wait actually.  We're going for dinner at the restaurant and then a bunch of us are going drinking and dancing.  Sort of a farewell to me thing.  I need to get my assignments done by next week.   I sold the last of my cds that i'm not keeping today.  The hardest thing wasn't actually selling them this time.  It was walking out of the store without buying anymore bcos i saw the new beastie boys album and the misfits of science single and argh, it was hard, lol.  I wonder what the music stores are like there.  And the bookstores.  I heard it's hard to get hold of english lit. there.  I did see a basketball club in Beijing which would be cool.  I can't find anything about snowboarding at their ski fields, all the talk about is skiing.  I hear there are lots of starbucks. Grrrrrrrrrr. Ok i'll shut up about that.   I'm worried about the coffee though. And yes, i do appreciate the fact that i'm travelling to a foreign country and i should appreciate the natural cuisine and what they have to offer and not be too westernised and moan, but fuck, i love coffee and as much as i can survive without it, i don't want to, lol.  I guess i can always get stuff sent over if there's nothing good there.    I'm really looking forward to learning chinese cooking and going to the markets there.  And trying peking duck.  I know you can get it here, but i'd rather try it where it originated from.  I can't wait for the fruit either bcos there's bound to be stuff i've never tried before.  And fresh lychees. Yum.

3627359,indUnk,"                 ann marie has been a great inspiration over the last few days as she has been calling just to chat.  she can relate to a lot of the feelings i'm having right now because she has been on several solo adventures of her own.  we talk about the uncertainties & unknowns that each person faces when they live outside their comfort zone.  don't get me wrong, when i blog these daily challenges, i'm not looking for sympathy.  i'm just sharing some of the feelings a person goes through when living on the edge.  everyday is filled with uncertainties from where will i sleep - eat - shop - find the library - post office - gas & what will the roads be like...will they be smooth - bumpy - curvy - hilly - or torn up.  with each new day and each new challenge we have to dig a little deeper within ourselves to find the courage to face them.

3626090,Communications-Media,"       At lunch today, one of my co-workers was complaining about this guy and his sporadic attempts at communication. We all agreed it was the three day rule, which was accomplished, followed by the one week rule.  My question is, what is with guys and this 3 day rule anyways? Don't they know they're not being slick and all of the female population is already well aware of it? Come up with something new! We know it's all a part of your 'game' and keeping us guessing. But what's the game when we are already aware of your plan. We just expect it 3 days later. Then later on in the day, my boss starts yelling from her office because she received an email containing great news on a story we're working on. Then she's trying to decide what to reply, and the only man in the office says, 'Wait until tomorrow and then email them back.' My boss answers, 'OK but what should I say tomorrow?' I jump in and say, 'This isn't a relationship, they're not dating, why does she have to wait until tomorrow.' To which my boss hysterically starts laughing and the only man once again says, 'I don't know, just wait for tomorrow to answer.' Men, we'll never understand their thinking patterns! And I'm still baffled on, what's with the waiting, huh?         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3616331,indUnk,"       One of the nonhuman residents in my body is a herpes virus. In the lip, thank goddess. He likes to come and hang out after I get sunburned, even just a little. Like I told you, the sun zaps my immune system. So when I went to the beach a week and a half ago, I was well aware that if my sunblock/shade combo was not 100%, I'd probably be getting a visit from Herpie.   By the time we were heading back, on Tues. the 29th, he was sending me emails. If I get my remedies on at that times, he might decide to go back and hide in my spine. By that evening I had some remedy on, and I thought he was just going to leave a note on the door, but by the next day there he was lounging on my lip. So no kissy-kissy for part 2 of vacation, the 4th of July weekend! Wah!  My consistent treatments since then lessened the average 3-4 week average visit of a herpes outbreak to a little over a week. There was no free beer in the fridge, so Herpie decided to go back to where he lives, which is between two vertebrae in my neck, next to my spine.  Ivieee's herpes simplex protocol: I wear dark lipstick if I am going to be in the sun. Sunblock lipbalms and such wear off and have an SPF nowhere close to my Manic Panic Purple Haze lipstick. (LM hates lipstick, so I didn't wear it at the beach this time! Is that love, or stupidity?) If your lips get sun exposure, or if you do whatever it is that triggers a sore, lick your lip and apply a dusting of Goldenseal powder right on the spot. (One single capsule is enough for a whole round of therapy, and for some reason the tincture of Goldenseal does not seem to help me.) When it wears off, do it again. That always does it for me, if I get it on by the 'tingle' stage. I didn't get to it in time this time, so I kept applying the Goldenseal powder, and alternated it with some of my Natural Magic Healing oil, because it has a little real Lemon Balm (Melissa) essential oil in it. This stuff is fabulously expensive, and very effective against Herpie. Finally, I had just made a tincture of Prickly Ash, and because of its topical anaesthetic properties, I put that on straight. It sure did kill the pain, and I wonder if its antimicrobial properties are effective on viruses too? Anyway, I never did get a big sore, it didn't hurt much, and it is almost gone now, and I'm sure looking forward to some good kissin!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3608609,Communications-Media,"             I run out my front door, down the stairs and along the gravel road. Abruptly the road becomes a trail and the trail leads to a rocky, dusty clearing. The sky is blood red with black clouds. Lightning flashes in the background. Thunder rumbles. What world am I in?  Sweat drips down my forehead. My lungs burn. I’m exhausted. I can’t stop to catch my breath. I don’t know what I’m fleeing from. All I know is that it’s evil. I look back. There’s nothing. Why am I running? Fear.  Finally my legs give way. I fall to the ground. I crawl forward a couple metres. My hands clasp red dirt as I pull myself forward.   Out of the corner of my eye, a blurry specter appears. My mind panics. Who is it? What does it want with me? The ghost takes shape. It wears a black hooded robe, carries a scythe, has skeleton hands and two beady red eyes. Death has come to claim my life.  I roll on my back and stare. I try to scream but my throat is dry.   “Do you know who I am?” Death’s voice booms.   I nod my head. I’ve met him before. My skin crawls.   “I’m here to guide you to the land of the dead.” The wraith lifts its blade high in the air. It has to kill my body before my soul can leave the world of the living behind.  I don’t want to leave my life, my family, my friends. I grab a handful of rocks. I throw them.  Death chuckles at my pitiful attempt. My last glimpse is the scythe’s shiny, silver tip penetrating my chest. Blood splatters everywhere. I shut my eyes.  When my eyelids open, I’m standing next to Death, naked. I don’t feel any pain. My chest bears no scars. I’m no longer afraid. I’m curious. What’s happening now?  “Follow me,” orders Death. It’s not a scary voice anymore. It’s almost soothing. A James Earl Jones type voice. The earth feels like a sandy beach on my bare feet.   “Where to?” I ask.   “You’ll find out shortly,” is its reply. I follow.   We head towards a black portal. Just before I step into the darkness, I awake in my bed. Blankets drenched in sweat. I feel good though. I take five deep breaths, roll over and fall back asleep.   Dying equals death.  I’ve heard it’s supposed to be a bad omen to die in your dreams, well your nightmares. I’ve been told that you die in real life shortly after. It’s not true. I’ve been killed numerous times in my dreams and one time I even went out looking to kill Death. I didn’t succeed, but damn was I close. Death beheaded me on an altar that time.  I’ve been hit by cars. I’ve been shot. I’ve plummeted to my death. I don’t just wake up at time of impact. I actually leave my body, rise up and look down upon myself. The first time was creepy. The second time wasn’t any better, but now I’m used to it.   I don’t know what happens in the afterlife, but I’m getting very curious. It's a new mystery to explore. It's something totally new and exciting. No one can warn you. No one can prepare you for what to expect. Religions try, but there are so many of them. Who is right? Are we reincarnated? Do we become that new baby born in the maternity ward and begin on another life? Heaven? Hell? Do we sail across the sea for eternal life like the elves in Lord of the Rings? Maybe our bodies are unplugged from the Matrix? We’re tossed into the used battery drawer.   Whatever it is I hope it’s fun. I hope it’s like Mardi Gras, spring break, the 4th of July all wrapped up as a Christmas present.   I'm sure Joel will tell me it's dark, gloomy and not fun. Screw you Joel.

3607859,Science,"       This past weekend, Krishan, Elizabeth and I decided to take a trip to Manali to see the Himalayas from the Kullu Valley. We began early for our 8 hour drive winding up the hills&nbsp;on mountain roads before reaching the town of Manali. We continued through the tourist town of Manali on to the village of Solang.&nbsp; We decided to splurge on the hotel room and stay at the Solang Valley Resort, said to be the best hotel in the valley. Thanks to the low season, we were able to get a very reasonably priced room with a balcony overlooking the Beas River. We could hear the water flowing from the room at night. Thankfully, the temperature was cool enough to allow us to sleep with the windows open and a blanket on. A nice break from the hot weather of Ludhiana. After checking into our room, we took a walk into the village of Solang, which remains relatively undistrubed by tourists. From both the village and the hotel, we were able to see a glacier, which unfortunately, like many of the world's glaciers, is melting.&nbsp; After our walk, we decided to go into Manali for dinner. The Mall in Manali is a long road lined with many shops as well as restaurants aimed at the tourists. We had dinner at a restaurant recommended by many called Chopsticks. Here we were able to have a nice dinner of Tibetan food.   The next day we returned to Manali to visit a Hindu Temple in a&nbsp;forest located right outside of the downtown area. We were lucky enough to see a procession that brought an idol up to the entrance of the temple as well as the preparation of food for those around the temple. It was incredible to see pots as large as bath tubs filled with dal, rice and tea. Next, we enjoyed the nature of the forest while sitting in journalling and reading. It was so peaceful and quiet. Our next stop was across from the forest, a visit to the Pine Tree Temple which is an official Hindu Temple that consists entirely of a tree. It is amazing how many people come each day to worship at this unconventional prayer site. To complete our day we travelled to the village of Naggar, halfway between Kullu and Manali. It was the capitol of Himachal for nearly 1500 years. Built partially up a steep mountain, there exists a museum of the Russian artist and philosopher Nikolai Roerich. The museum is in his former home and includes many of his watercolor mountain landscapes.&nbsp; The property also includes a handicraft museum with works from Himachal, Pakistan, Russia, Kashmir and Jammu, China, Nepal and Uzbekistan (Elizabeth felt quite at home). After viewing the collection, we then wandered part way down the hill to reach Naggar Castle. This wooden beam and stone construction was built by the Raja Sidh Singh about 500 years ago and remained as the official residence until the 1970s when it became a hotel. The Castle includes some amazing wood carvings and a small temple in the center. The focal point of the temple is a large stone slab. This stone was carried to the site by a swarm of wild bees (the Gods) and the temple was built around it. Additionally, in the basement, we were told that there was a small museum. When we stumbled upon the museum, we found one small room with a display case. We were somewhat disappointed to say the least.   On Saturday, we had intended to hike to the glacier but our guide (a Tibetan man who has been leading since he was 15 and whose sister is the youngest Indian woman to climb Everest) advised against it. Instead, he decided to take us on an easy hike from 6,000ft to 12,000ft elevation. This was only easy for him. After rising about 2,500ft the elevation made it too difficult for me to breath so I stopped and was told to wait about 3 hours while the others finished the hike. They made it only to the saddle of the mountain, 500ft shy of the peak. This did provide them with some amazing views of the valley on the opposite side of the mountain. 5 hours later I joined them again for the hike down back to the hotel. Needless to say, the trek was challenging but incredibly rewarding.   On Sunday, we decided to take it somewhat easy after the previous day's exertion. We drove up to Rohtong pass (13,000ft) following a seemingly endless number of switchbacks in the process of the climb. The view from the top was too amazing to do justice with words. All around us were snowy peaks that were at least our height. It was incredibly cold and windy, but awe inspiring. To get a better view of the Lahaul(sp?) Valley on the opposite side of the pass, we drove down to the village of Kokar(sp?). This is the last place that foreigners may travel on that road without having to check in with the police. They want to be able to track who travels on the dangerous roads in case they go missing. In the village we stopped at a roadside Dhaba and had a delicious breakfast of stuffed paranthas and tea. So yummy! The drive provided us with an impression of the very different valley. There were minimal trees in that valley and many steep rock cliffs. We were also able to see clouds pass over Rohtong and literally disappear into the air. It was like out of a movie. Next, we travelled to Old Manali, a portion of the village that is less comerically developed and now the home of many 'free spirits' and Israelis, both attracted by the abundance of marijuana. There we were able to have some wonderful Israeli food, totally unexpected in the hills of India. Finally, we walked to the Mall in Manali and did some shopping and visited two Buddhist Temples in the city. They were surprisingly peaceful given their central location. We then treated ourselves to a candle lit dinner of chinese take out in our hotel room. Nothing says elegance like eggplant and soup eaten out of bags.   On Monday, we were forced to return to Ludhiana and work, but not before attempting to get an American breakfast. Luckily it was more homey than we had even imagined. We got pancakes and iced coffee which we ate over a conversation with Nick and Max, two Rutgers students who are travelling through India this summer as an Indian would. It was wonderful to share travel stories and a bit of discussion about the news at home. Our drive home (8 hours straight through) was pretty uneventful, but did allow us half an hour of monsoon driving. It was delightful and the air smelled wonderful afterwards, a pleasant change from the desiel fumes we usually have to breath in. We returned to Ludhiana by dinner time more refreshed and relaxed than we had been all trip.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought it was quite good...I know it's weird for me to be talking about it now since it happened many months ago (before Christmas), but I am just now realizing how much I miss it.  I like most all sodas except for Diet Pepsi (Pepsi One is ok though...).  I love the vanilla colas.  If you like both Vanilla Coke and Pepsi Vanilla, check this...v. coke contains artificial vanilla flavorings while pepsi v. contains pure vanilla extract.  Also, I mentioned in an earlier post that C2 contains phenylalanine that causes cancer in lab rats...Pepsi just introduced Pepsi Edge which has half the sugar and carbs (same thing as C2), but does not replace it with the fake sugar!  Amen to that, Pepsi!  They seem to be thinking more about what's 'healthy in an already bad-for-your-body soda'...which is enough for me.  Even though Pepsi tends to go the natural way, I still buy Coca Cola more now just because the shape of the bottle is more appealing to me than the regular Pepsi bottle...lol...what a tart...

3601500,Student,"       This morning, I awoke to the sound of my little sister's cries. The kittens she cared for have been taken to Ottawa yesterday, without my cousin's permission (they have been caring for them ever since they were found, and they both really wanted one. He was very mad, while my sister was very sad...) I told him I would go over to his house, but I didn't even call. I feel horrible - I got to bed at 5:30 this morning, was awoken around 12:00; I told him I'd be there at 9 o'clock. I figured, might as well just call him tomorrow, when he's calmed down... :/  I finally met my neighbours. The girl is very nice and easy to talk to - she's the kind of person who makes you comfortable in her presence. I tried to be friendly (and hope I achieved to be) - we went over to her house, and played cards (cheat - I think it's also called bullshit?) with our siblings (her brother and sister, my little sister). Only Evil (my fourteen years old sister) has yet to meet them. The boy (who's 15) should definetely cut his hair, is friendly and somewhat funny, asked lots of questions. He's going in grade 11, but that's because he skipped his fifth grade. I think we could be good friends.  Now, I should eat.

I know that these places have been 'threatened' since the the attacks on the the US on September 11, 2001, but the latest threats against our country by Al Qaeda have shown that they have a great amount of detail regarding the specific targets threatened. One of the landmarks, the Citigroup Center is located just a couple blocks from my apartment. Al Qaeda supposedly has notes on the blueprints of the buildings, the security systems and security schedule, notes on the assumed structural damage if an explosive was to go off. That, to me is beyond a minor threat... you don't waste time and energy getting studying that information for no reason. I don't feel to safe living that close.

3594427,Technology,"                 Got into a mini-argument again with my boss. Clash of personalities talaga. It's one of those days when I ask myself, 'Dear Lord, why did you make so ambitious, that I actually took this job?'  When people found out I was going to work for this guy, they were all amazed at my courage. It could also be that they thought I was that stupid to get out of my comfort zone and risk everything for someone who has a really bad reputation. Anyway, despite all the warnings I got, I went ahead with this decision.   I have absolutely nothing in common with this guy. He's a hard-core sales man who thinks only in terms of numbers while I am a practical person who has interests outside of my job. I read books, watch movies, appreciate art, etc. This guy claims he is a Buddhist, but he can't even read about the teachings of Buddha unless it's in comic book format! So when we have conference calls or see each other, we just discuss work. Other than that, there is nothing else to talk about.  God knows how much I have changed for my job. I have turned a blind eye to a lot of things that go against my principles. I have learned how to be creative about the truth, gone to a not-so-wholesome KTV, completely turned away from whatever Philosophy taught me about how to treat fellow human beings and given up a normal life with my immediate family. Still, it is not enough. That is what I hate about my life right now. True, I have never been more financially stable, but there is much more to life than money.  I'm going to start saving every single cent I can, so I can get out of this shitty hellhole sooner.

I've been to Paris! Yipppieeeee! Well, but the start wasn't that good. When we were at the ticketmachine a colleague called and told me my boss died. I haven't had a very good relation with him but Sabine told me I turned white and looked really quite bad... We've had the funeral last Wednesday - I suppose I got the cold from there. However, we got the tickets and took the RER (Reseau Express Regional) to the inner City and I've been very proud I found the way to the hotel without ANY map :-D!

We get along with eachother very well and his eyes...aaaaaw...I'm simply very very happy I met him :-) Very happy not having to seek anymore. We'll see, if things'll work out, but I believe they will!  Well, that's it for today. I think I'll go to the sofa and watch some DVD.

3585229,Accounting,"       I'm currently doing my GCSEs. I've come to hate my exams. I've a number of points to work on here, so I'll get started. First up, I'm a hayfever sufferer. The exams are in early summer, the time when hayfever is at it's worst. Most of my friends turn out to suffer the same thing; The problem is only enhanced by the fact that my school won't let it's studentss near the school building between exams; We have to sit on the field, which is ringed by hedges and trees. Today, I did my English Language exam, and I can honestly say, I'm sure I buggered it up. I'm positive it's not a good thing for half the students in the hall to be sniffing, rubbing eyes that are itching to the point where they can't see, sneezing copiously, and generally feeling crappy. To compound the problem, it's intensely hot in the exam hall, not helped by the fact that it's bloody boiling outside. Sweaty, itchy, sneezing, squinting students will not achieve success as they might if they weren't any of the mentioned conditions. Yet despite all this, the exam boards persist in insisting that we do our exams in early summer. I am sure it'd be a little more sensible if we did our exams in early- to midwinter, and changed our school year at the same time as the rest of the year. It'd risk more colds, of course, but these are not assured - simply likely. Hayfever is certain, and the number of sufferers is on the sharp increase. My second point of much agitation is that my school is adamant that we are NOT TO BE ON THE SCHOOL PREMESIS EXCEPT IN EXAMS. This statement has numerous faults - to start with, they want us here half an hour in advance of the start of the exam, and often give us two exams a day seperated by about two hours - about enough time for me to walk home, open the door, close the door and walk back to school. In these two hours, I'm not supposed to be on school premises, although they don't mind us being on the field (which as I've already mentioned, is a bit of a bugger), but I can't go home because it'll be a waste of time. So what do I do? I usually just sit on the field. I have to, otherwise I'll be late. I have to endure itchyness and a general feeling of illness throughout the second exam. Sometimes I've been round to a very kind friend's house in between (still a half hour walk, but better than my house). My third problem is that there are two exams a day - one at nine in the morning. It'd be nice if they only ever put one exam up in one day, and in the afternoon, so we could be well rested and prepared for it. Sadly, I get to school tired and irritable, and end up daydreaming precious exam time away. I hate GCSEs. My third problem concerns the school's somewhat lax methods of checking for cheating. This sounds odd, coming from a student, but the measures in place are hardly adequate. I've walked into the exam room without the suspicious bulges in my pockets being checked (hankies - for the hayfever, but they could have writing on, or be notes as far as the exam board are concerned), without the backs of my hands being checked, without the palms of my hands being checked, without the books we're given to use being checked, and all sorts of other things not checked. The person who comes before me in the register seems to get restless a good deal of the time, and often turns around to look at me or his friends - an offence for which we were assured you would be disqualified for. He's not even reprimanded, and a lot of people do it. I'm amazed at how often you could cheat and not be caught, but the teachers clearly don't realise this - perhaps they are sure someone else is covering it, or maybe they've lost all their childish inventiveness, the ability to think of ways to cheat. I don't personally cheat, and I'm not sure any of my friends would, but it'd be sickeningly easy to get away with. The final problem I have is the school's security measures on exam rooms. We've often had year 10s walking past the door open to the outside (it's too hot in the exam rooms, as mentioned. so they attempt to alleviate this by opening a door) shouting at us, or making loud noises in an attempt to distract us (Why? What is their problem? What's to stop us doing this to them next year?). A teacher has always shushed them, but not before the damage is done and you've lost your concentration. Our exam room also has a door to the inside of the school. We've had people knock noisily on this door and run off. This has a similar effect, except of course, the teachers go and check but don't find out, come back in and it happens again. Perhaps it doesn't occur to the teachers to keep someone outside the door preventing idiocy, but sadly, no. There are all sorts of other problems, such as the idiots who come in late, and are led along the front (as they grin manically at having dirupted the exam) to their seat, despite the school's assertion that lateness was not to be tolaerated. These can be left though, I'm sick of this post. Exams aren't exactly my favourite topic. I'm going to get some tea, my nerves need soothing.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3584504,indUnk,"             Hebrews 12   God Disciplines His Sons   1Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles, and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us. 2Let us fix our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 3Consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.  4In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 5And you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons:     'My son, do not make light of the Lord's discipline,         and do not lose heart when he rebukes you,      6because the Lord disciplines those he loves,         and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son.' 7Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is not disciplined by his father? 8If you are not disciplined (and everyone undergoes discipline), then you are illegitimate children and not true sons. 9Moreover, we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it. How much more should we submit to the Father of our spirits and live! 10Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in his holiness. 11No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.   I used to have this history teacher when I was fourteen who asked history questions and caned those who couldn't answer correctly. You wouldn't believe how much my friends and I hated him. We wrote insulting poems and songs about him (I still see his name plastered all over the toilets). It's amazing how creative fourteen year olds high on teenage angst can be.  On the days we knew would be a question-answer-caning session, we were forced to study doubly hard (or in my case, actually study). Not much help, as he ensured most of his questions referred to the most obscure of obscure footnotes. I lost count of the times I got caned by around May. I endured pain, torment, and suffering brought on by this tyrannical history teacher for a whole year, never actually believing I'd make any progress.  My final exam marks were pretty brilliant. Really brilliant! The kind of brilliance parents reward you for. I was in denial for a while, as my pride refused to admit the reason for this amazing turnaround (my marks before that were mediocore at best). Deep down, I knew the reason. Who wouldn't be motivated by the prspect of being caned for not achieving certain marks?   Today, I greatly respect that teacher, and because of that we have as good a teacher-student relationship as any someone like him's likely to have. Not everyone in my class that year appreciates him, seeing what he did as disciplining rather than torture. Truth is, we needed that kind of discipline to succeed. At least I needed it.  Who enjoys disciplining? Who can see it's what makes us grow stronger? Verse 11 says 'No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it'. Discipline brings good, but not at the time we receive it. I felt no goodness at the moment the cane struck my hand for the very first time (something about the tin mining in Selangor). I felt good recieving my final exam marks. I felt good when I realised that the discipline was what enabled me to do what I did.  God disciplines us everyday. It might not be as direct as being caned or struck by lightning, but the adversities we face everyday are God's ways of moulding us to be more like Jesus. What do we do? Verses 5-7 remind us to remain strong in knowing that we're disciplined because we're loved, because we're His sons. If we surrender rather than resist being disciplined, we can see that God wants us to grow spiritually strong.  There's a parallel between my teacher's disciplining and God's tough love. Of course, I'm in no way supporting what my teacher did, using the cane in the classroom. That's up to your own interpretation, whether you're able to accept that kind of disciplining in order to grow stronger. I'm happy God loves me enough to discipline me, moulding me into a better person. I still see that teacher from time to time. I can't remember a single nasty thing that we wrote about him.

3584504,indUnk,"             Romans 5  Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ  12Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned-- 13for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. 14Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. 15But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! 16Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 17For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. 18Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. 19For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous. 20The law was added so that the trespass might increase. But where sin increased, grace increased all the more, 21so that, just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.   The lyrics to the song 'What's So Funny ('Bout Peace, Love &amp; Understanding)' by Elvis Costello say alot really. 'As I walk through this wicked world, searching for light in the darkness of insanity...' says what alot of us feel, that the world is inherently (for the most part, at least) a cold place full of evil. Essentially, it is true but not in a pessimistic way. See, according to Paul; the world is full of sin because of what Adam did. That single mistake thousands of years ago caused all of mankind to be predisposed to sin. Sin and death entered the world through one man (verse 12), the moment Adam disobeyed God. So the way things stand, by right; we should have no chance at all. We're all sinners from the day we're born, and indeed peace, love &amp; understanding should be alien concepts to us.  Fortunately, Jesus came to save us. In Romans 5, it says Jesus came to put right the sins that started from Adam. While condemnation followed that one sin of Adam, justification followed the many, many sins of all men. So you see, because of Adam, all men are born with a tendency to sin easily. On the other hand, those who come to know Jesus will be born again in Him.  The world isn't a nice place (perhaps so we long for heaven) some of the time. It's this way because of sin. God has sent Jesus so that we have the chance to be saved from death. And while we're here on earth, by trusting in Jesus, we'll be moved by the Holy Spirit to live a life more pleasing to God. We're sinners because of Adam, we're saved from it because of Jesus. We have no excuses: What's so funny about peace, love &amp; understanding?          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3580102,Government,"             What might you ask is BIP ?  There are many uses for the word BIP. 1) BIP as a beverage - Remember Beep juice.  That stuff was awesome.   2) BIP as in food - If you work for Agriculture like I do then you have a good grasp of what BIP is.  There's been that BSE problem with BIP (you know, BIP Spoingiform Ensephalatory, or something like that).  The actual word is Beef.  But some pronounce it as BIP.  Especially where I come from. 3) BIP as a sound - When you honk your horn it goes 'BIP'.  What the hell am I talking about ?  Next topic please.  If any of you guys like fishing, I suggest MacArthur Falls.  Lots of big Pickerel with none of the hassel and disappointment of catching Catfish.  Mmmmm...Pickerel cheeks.  Also, I would like to check out Great falls.  S'pose to be good there 2.  Damn.  Finished 5th in Poker tonight.  Wasn't a good night.  I miss my friend Rhoden.  Where are you ?  Come back.  Just a warning.  If you try to cross the boarder with some Bip they might not let you.  It's been a while since I've been on this thing...oh well.  I feel like drinking tommorow night.  No BIP though, just some alcohol will do fine.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3578902,Engineering,             How come I can see it all from a new perspective now?  I feel like I'm seeing things from her eyes for the first time.  Does that make me a bad person?  Or was I really just that stubborn?  And does she really believe me when I say that I can see it from her perspective?  I don't think she does.  It would  have  to make a huge difference if she did.  I feel like I need to scream or break something.  I know it won't fix things but I'm so frustrated right now.  I also feel like I'm going to go crazy.  Every e-mail and phone call I've received in the last week has brought a faint hope that it was her writing/calling to tell me she had changed her mind and that everything was going to be OK.    I still can't believe she is doing this.  It's not getting any easier.  If I wasn't half numb right now I don't think I could even get out of bed.  It is a true living hell.

3578152,indUnk,"             Today is my fourth day of recovering from my appendectomy.  I don't regret having it, otherwise I'd be dead by now.  It's a painless procedure of removing the most useless part of our body--the appendix, which is a small pouch connected to the large intestines, and once it gets infected, the only way to cure it is to remove it.  It's just like shit; it happens (for no apparent reason)  Furthermore, appendicitis cannot be accurately detected through x-ray or ultrasound.  You first have to feel excruciating pain just above the right side of your pelvic bone.  And then, you consult a doctor and wait for a recommendation to be admitted to the hospital, while your bills start piling up.  Once admitted, several neophyte doctors would have to wake you up in the middle of your sleep just to perform a redundancy of physical check-up and interrogation that are completely exhausting for you.  Until, you've gotten full of it, then you tell them to operate you right away.  But no, they're still guessing whether it's gastro-enteritis, urinary tract infection, or appendicitis.  With all the conjectures you hear, you'd want to be diagnosed with gastro-enteritis or UTI to avoid being disected.  And then when you've dreamt that you won't have to be operated anymore, your main doctor wakes you up and tells you that you indeed have to be operated.  You think to yourself that the scar could be covered with a tattoo or be laser-removed later on, so the operation would be like brushing your teeth.  After having been sedated, which was great and not having felt the pain of slices and stitches, you wake up and notice that you're not wearing the same hospital gown that you wore when you were brought to the OR.  And then images of Uma Thurman in Kill Bill start haunting you.  You think to yourself that a handful of people have seen you stark naked or worse, have even raped you.  Then they bring you back to your expensive room and you doze back to sleep.  When you wake up, you feel nothing.  And then when the anaesthesia runs out, you feel dampness on your back and you realize that you had just peed on the bed.  You want to cry because you acted like a baby, when in fact if you cry, you'll actually transform into one.  So you rebel from that thought and laugh instead.   When you feel that you can walk again, you lie back on the bed and cry because the man that you love hasn't visited you yet.  And then he calls you up and tells you that he'll visit you the following morning.  Afterwards, you can't wait for nightfall to come so you could go back to sleep and wake up in the morning and find him sitting next to you with concern and relief in his eyes.  But then, you've already eaten your lunch and still no loved one came.  So you cry and tell yourself that he'll never come until he calls again and tells you that he was sorry that he wasn't able to visit you that morning.  Instead, he tells you that he'll definitely drop by between 9 to 10 p.m.  Your face sparkles again from the anticipation of his arrival and you try to amuse yourself by watching the TV to kill time.  And then 9 o'clock comes and he still hasn't arrived.  You wait for another hour and then another until you decide to dial his number and check if he's ever going to come.  He tells you that he's parking his car already.  Then you become excited and you remind yourself to be calm because it's not good for your condition.  Ten minutes later,you hear a knock on the door and you say 'Come in', and then you see him entering through the door with a can of Pringles in his hand.  You hide your disappointment that he didn't bring you flowers so you put a big smile on your face.  Then when he comes near you, you yearn for him to kiss you on the lips but then he kisses you on the cheek.  He tells you how glad he is to see you looking well despite the operation.  And then his phone rings and you hear him tell his caller that he's in the hospital and that he'll only be staying for 20 minutes.  You become disappointed again because he made you wait for a long time and yet he'll be staying for a quickie.  But then you keep smiling at him and you and he talk as if nothing happened.  Then later he tells you that he has to go.  You tell him to give you a hug, which he does.  And then you ask for a kiss, which he doesn't give you right away, but when he does, he only gives you a quick smack on the lips and reminds you that he has to go because his cousin is waiting for him.  Then you let him go, but you couldn't resist him so you ask for one last hug.  After a few hesitations, he puts his arms around you and tells you not to be stubborn and to let him leave.  You ask for one more kiss, but then he tells you that you're a bad girl for tempting him.  What else could you do?  You love him and you missed him, eventually you'd be wanting a kiss.  Couldn't he see that it's all you could do since your doctor had told you that you can't perform any abdominal exercises for 2 months.  Then he kisses you on the cheek and you let him go.  When he left, you suddenly felt empty.  It's a kind of emptiness that has no end because you realize that you don't matter much to him as he does to you.  Then you tell yourself to forget about him for the mean time and let him miss you instead.  The following day you get discharged from the hospital.  You feel bad because your stomach is bloated from the operation.  And since, you're only allowed to move minimally, you put your full attention in writing your book, which needs to be finished by June 26.  As you progress in your book, you become confident that you could do without him because you could achieve a lot with your writing.  So you go on writing and find yourself laughing at the memory of yourself crying over him on your hospital bed.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3576039,Engineering,"       OK…I’m back!  I took my wife up on her “offer” to take a vacation by myself and ended up in Chile.  Patagonia is *!cold!* this time of year but it was a nice time.  I spent a lot of time doing two things…riding around the mountains by myself (well, semi- by myself…the guide wouldn’t let me get out of his sight, but I guess that is what I paid him for) and sitting by this huge fireplace drinking Pisco Sours by the pitcher and staring at the mountains.  Yes, that means I took up drinking again, at least for a few days…it seemed to be worthwhile.  I kind of liked the Pisco when I first started, but I am sick of it by now.  I don’t know how the Chileans can stand to drink that crap day in and day out.  And you may ask – Roto, what did you do with all of this idle time?  That is easy to answer – I thought about Annah.  I thought about the how and the why of our relationship.  I expect if one was to ask her, there is no relationship to even think about – so why do I feel differently.  I went through all the psychology of it…I’m quite capable of that…and decided that I fell in love with her simply because of who she is.  And I am not able to just fall out of love because she wants me to.  Maybe I don’t have a real objective opinion of the situation.  In any case, I am resigned to just think about her and not do anything about it.  I think of calling her every morning, but I promised her that I would never do that again.  I will try to hold to that.  On a separate note, I had a conversation with my wife when I got home.  She was in a pretty good mood…must have been caused by my absence…and we talked about our marriage a bit.  She said a few things that I didn’t understand and so I just ask her flat out…”You really don’t like me do you?”  Her response, without hesitating, was “No, I really don’t like you at all anymore.”  You know, if I was like a total jerk, I could understand that.  But I am not a jerk [which might be disputable since I have this girlfriend thing going while I am married, you need to read more to understand].  I do anything and everything that a good loving husband is expected to do.  I might even do more, at least compared to all the men that I know.  Maybe she has just learned to not like me because of our history and has chosen to not expose herself to any potential crap from me, if should ever fail again.  I don’t know.  Well, enough of this.  It is the weekend…I will go see what it holds in store for the broken man.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3572471,Communications-Media,"   So I socialized today.&nbsp; And yesterday.&nbsp; I got a couple e-mails inviting me to interesting little grad student and young professional things—a foreign film screening and a networking event—so I got in my car and I drove there, like millions of people in L.A. do when a friend calls and tells them, hey, dude there’s a neat screening of this really twisted Russian film, or hey, co-worker I have an occasional beer with after work, guess what, I heard about this get-together among people who work their ass off 40-50 hours a week at the same type of job we have and let’s go commiserate and talk about how much we hate our bosses and the petulance of the well-to-do American executive and hey, we might even make a good friend.&nbsp; Imagine that. &nbsp;A good friend.&nbsp; A new friend.  &nbsp;  I get to the foreign film screening and no one is in the theater.&nbsp; Great, I think.&nbsp; Drove up here for nothing.&nbsp; Wasted all this gas.&nbsp; So glad I decided to socialize.&nbsp; Then I walk outside and see the grad students, playing a sun-splashed game of croquet on the University quad.&nbsp; They’re all tan and sweaty and red-faced on this dry-hot day, because dry-hot is the only way they can get hot and sweaty playing croquet.&nbsp; They’re also chasing each other around, playing flirtatious games with the croquet mallot.&nbsp; My good friend in the Dodger hat slides the nub in the performance artist girl’s butt-cleavage.&nbsp; Hysterical laughter ensues, and the faces get redder and everyone’s having a great time and let’s reach in the big red cooler and get another beer and isn’t it gosh-darn lovely to be 25 and still have care-free summers?&nbsp; And who the hell is this guy in the chinos and discount Kohl’s dress shirt?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Dude, aren’t you hot?” offers my Dodger fan friend, barely recognizable, having grown a pillowy tuft of hair since I last saw him three months ago.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I grin sheepishly, nodding at the crooked wickets.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Looks like something you do in the summer.”&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Nobody gets my ironic attempt at humor.&nbsp; Yeah, dipshit, they all think, it does look like something you do in the summer.&nbsp; That’s why we’re doing it.&nbsp; Go back to your cubicle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The foreign film is indulgent, like the moderator said it would be, and afterward everyone pairs off into the summer romances that have blossomed, and everyone asks me when I’m graduating.&nbsp; Like they can’t wait to get rid of me.&nbsp; Like they never had me.&nbsp; But then, how could they have ever had me?&nbsp; I sit behind a desk all day.&nbsp; I was lucky to make it to this screening on time at 7 p.m.&nbsp; They run in the park and wallow in the shade of California green tall spiky trees and feed each other grapes and wine and Miller Lite.&nbsp; They enjoy life.&nbsp; And I can’t be their friends.&nbsp; Not unless they’ll carry a Blackberry around and check it regularly for the latest off-color e-mail forward, anyway.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So I socialized and had a crappy time and felt like a dad showing up early to pick his 13-year-old son from a testosterone-drenched sleep-over, one with Playboys and Ultimate Fighting and Hustlers and Bench Press Contests and Barely Legals. I was a stuffed-shirt spoiler.&nbsp; Maybe I needed to hang out with my element: work-a-holic twenty-somethings.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So the next evening I get in my good-times-mobile and head north again.&nbsp; I feel like a mouse in a maze trying to park in the cramped little beach town, but I finally slide into a curbside without red markings.&nbsp; On the way to the meeting place, I break a twenty at a dive bar and pound a Red Stripe, at once an attempt to avoid awkwardness in a group pay-for-the-check situation and an attempt to get a little buzz going before meeting a bunch of strangers.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But from the moment I shake Heidi’s hand, I know letting beer slip through my lips was akin to chugging a 40-ouncer before a basketball game.&nbsp; Networking is an endurance event, a discipline worth mastering.&nbsp; Drinking will throw you from your game.&nbsp; Heidi would know.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “I’ve been networking and networking and networking,” Heidi says.&nbsp; “You have to do it so hard-core.&nbsp; And here in L.A? &nbsp;Please.&nbsp; It’s all about who you know.&nbsp; It’s never merit.&nbsp; And believe me, I have merit.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Berkeley grad.&nbsp; Hello?&nbsp; Held a mid-management slot in San Francisco.&nbsp; And these people are trying to look at me for entry-level work?&nbsp; Are they kidding me?”  &nbsp;  Nobody else is any different, except a lovely undersized couple from a head-hunting firm literally trying to sell me.&nbsp; Everyone gripes about their current job and about how their tenacious networking has yet to pay off.&nbsp; My networking has yet to advance beyond hooking my DSL line up to the hub, so I guess I’m in trouble.&nbsp; I wanted to have a few laughs, pick up some job leads, maybe, find a way out of my current hell-in-a-cubicle.&nbsp; All I got was a sales pitch and a twenty-minute sermon on forging connections and collecting as many business cards as you can from a girl who apparently didn’t deem me worthy, because she left without requesting a business card.&nbsp; And then there was the girl I remembered from the last networking event I went to a year ago, who didn’t remember me and seemed freaked out when I greeted her by name.&nbsp; Then she politely told me to take a hike, “Go talk to Larry and Davida….they can help you find a better job.”&nbsp; In other words, go walk into a sales pitch.&nbsp; You’re scaring me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So after two days of flaunting my formidable social graces, it’s time for a consolation prize: a 40 of Mickey’s.&nbsp; I pull into the Liquor store near home.&nbsp; It’s an easy summer night and the tall, lean Armenian attendant I know too well stands outside.&nbsp; Must be slow in there.&nbsp; I feel a little uneasy walking past him, making him go back to work, becoming the only man in an empty temple of booze.&nbsp; But soon I have company.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  “Hey-ah, Dood, whasssup?”  &nbsp;  It’s a stumbling drunk in a blue hockey jersey.&nbsp; He’s heading for the same cooler I am.&nbsp; I grab my Mickey’s, expecting to hear a “Good call, dude,” but instead:  &nbsp;  “Ah, it’s Sarmuch, boy.&nbsp; Sarmush, how ya doin’?&nbsp; Back here now, huh?”  &nbsp;  Sarmuch the Armenian attendant nods politely, then walks towards the register to check me out.  &nbsp;  “They usually got you over on 4th and Ximeno now, huh?” hockey guy bellows, loud enough to crack a mini-bottle.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I don’t care how Sarmuch responds.&nbsp; I am in the liquor store, joining a man, who so frequents the local liquor stores he notices when folks shift from site to site, in buying a 40-ouncer.&nbsp; Maybe  he’s  my kind of guy.&nbsp;   ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3572165,Student,"       well, we are now in inverness. We took the bus up from Glasgow at 11:15 and arrived here at 3:30. we are staying in a hostel, which is kinda like a dorm - there are lots of rooms with bunkbeds, and you share them with other people. it is a lot nicer than i thought it would be, but then, i haven't seen the other 3 girls who are in our room :-P.  friday went...alright. there was trouble with the bank not transfering the money for the loan, so the Quigley's couldn't move in until today. Thankfully, the owners of their new home still let  us move stuff in on friday, so that all there is to do today is move mattresses, clothes, and other things that they needed over the weekend.  on saturday we went up to Stirling. once again, it was rainy and cold, but we still got to visit the Castle and the Wallace Monument. we went to the top of the monument, but i only stayed there for - half a minute, because it was sooo windy it felt like i would be blown off! the mission team had a free day, so Joe (from Broomall RPC) came to Stirling with us. Then we met the rest of the mission team, Rob and Jess Edgar and Rob's parents at the Caledonian Brewrey in Edinburgh for a Caley. A Caley is Scottish dancing. It was sooo much fun! i have never had more fun dancing than i did then. i didnt know any of the dances, and neither did anyone else that i was with, but we went through them quickly before picking up the speed, and it was really really neat. ten times better than dancing at prom :-P there was one dance where there is 2 couples, and they are in a circle guy-girl-guy-girl, and the guys lift the girls up and spin them around!! :-P it's called the basket. it was very very fun. too bad we don't have Caley's in Pittsburgh.  well, we are about to head out to Loch Ness to search for the monster :-P.

I joined and it took awhile to get started but finally people were like ripping each other apart. Josh and Matt kept saying Gabe was a really good rapper and he got targeted in this one guy's rap. So everyone thinks Gabe is this extremely good freestyler and they tell him to go and instead of saying anything he starts blaring this old diva-type song with a really funky rhythm. I was laughing so hard I was crying. A few battles later and after Ryan joined, he decided to tell them I'm really good. So I start talking on the mic and they all want me to go. In the meantime, Matt wants to scrim and gives me the ip/pw so I join and then the guy that I was going against started rapping and he was really good. OK I'm still in a scrim on CS now but it's my turn. I have no clue what to do so I sit there for a few seconds... then I just start singing an old Spice Girls song that I shouldn't remember the lyrics to. They all laugh at me and RYAN haha starts singing along and thats the last thing I heard before I got banned from the server. I'd still say I won my freestyle battle, so 'you'd better recognize.'  CPL Finals  SK got totally destroyed by EYE, so I guess it's cool that there are new champs but I wish the US would bring it home.  Jason and Tommy and Carl get home WEdnesday, we can finally get nLk started. I'd say I'm not doing too bad for being inactive for a few months, I've been putting a lot of frags on the board.  I hope everything goes how you want it to go if you've figured that out yet, I hope he knows what he wants and you're happy in the end.  Good night, people.  Also, I was looking around my whole web/programming directory and I found some of my old Java work and realized how HORRIBLE of a programmer I was just a year ago.  I mean, who needs the 2 while loops to check for a win in tic tac toe when you can write 8 separate if statements amounting to at least 3 times the work that would've been done on the loops? I'm thinking since I know the general syntax I might be able to teach myself the rest of Java.  I've also been like literally absorbing the whole PHP functions list in an attempt to be a better coder.  If I'm bored enough tomorrow I'm gonna make a web-based FTP client cuz I'm cool.  Oh yeah, that and because the IRC module for PHP is not free (probably isnt too hard to crack though.)  Yeah either that or just write random scripts and make them come together and do something useful.  Only one person I know will have any idea what site this is a ripoff of:   urlLink JoshTeam   I'm just going on and on and on.   Ryan can play some mean Celine Dion.

3571306,Student,"       Ah. Finally free. No school, no worries. Damn, it's gunna be a nice 2 months off! *Sigh*...it's off to a better start than any other summer. I was such a loner! (What's the difference from now, eh? '-__-) I'm still a loner at heart ^_~. Anyway...I just came back from the movies and I saw Shrek 2(FINALLY)! I have dubbed thy donkey/dragon/mutant babies, DRAGONKIES! Now I want one! Lol! As you may have guessed, I'm quite sugar high from all that candy I ate at the theatre! ^^; So pretty much, this post is randomness all the way! Muwahahahahahaha! Hah! I can see you shaking your head! Don't you laugh at me! Only I can laugh at me :D! Hehe...well now that that's over, why don't I talk about something, uh, less pointless ^^'? Hmmm, let's see...I saw my brother graduate on Tuesday and it was so weird to see him up on stage! Oh and all the pretty dresses! Ooooh can't wait till I grad! It's going to be soooo fun picking out and trying on dresses until I find the perfect one! But then again, gradding is so nerve-racking. I mean, you gotta go off to college or university after the summer, not lil ol' Claremont anymore. You gotta make it on your own. When I saw the ceremony, I thought to myself, 'I'm going to go through this in 3 years,'. Three years isn't that long either ya know. It's strange how we've come so far, yet we haven't even seen half of our lives yet. o_O I'm really scaring myself now!

I tried to buy a blue icee at bonfante gardens, there were 2 kiosks that sold strawberry and cherry. 2 red flavors, that never happens! and the strawberry icee is definitely the worst flavor ever. much worse than candy cane.   then i tried to buy a blue snow cone at the garlic festival. silly me assuming that the 2 most likely colors are red and blue. luckily they didn't try to sell me a garlic snow cone, and they had bubble-gum, but it was pink.

Well that didnt really bother me because I needed to clean the house anyways because I hadnt this week, but ya know. So I cleaned and got ready to go with my mom when she got home so that we could go back to school shopping. We were out until about 3:30 when I came home and got ready to go out with Jessica and Brandy. We ended up going to see Little Black Book and ran into Clayton. So while we were out in the parking lot we decided to go ahead and decorate his car with window chalk. Then we headed to wal-mart to get some more window chalk because we were all out. While we were there we ended up turning a few heads...lol...I mean come on 3 girls in mini skirts at 10:00pm in the car parts section. We had some weirdo guys follow us when we were leaving and then some guys yell at us in the parking lot in there car. Then we went back up to the movies to see if there was anyone else there that we knew so that we could write on their car. Well there was no one really, it was pretty dull for a friday night, so went went to Burger King to eat and I think the people there got tired of us, but it doesnt matter because we one some free food. Its soo much fun hanging out with them, because for the most part I just cant stop laughing. On the way home we had to stop and have a little Fire Drill, because of technical problems...lol. So tomorrow I gotta get up early and then head out to arlington with the parents to go shopping again, and hopefully Ill get my sandals. Till then, Later Days                 ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3569400,indUnk,"       Here is an email I got that annoyed me. After it is my response I mailed to the person who sent it to me.   ------email------    Sorry about more political info, but you can't know too much about the Kerry's:  Following is a brief background on Mrs. John Kerry . She hates being called that, by the way: Maria Teresa Thiersten Simoes-Ferreira Heinz Kerry. Married Senator Kerry in 1995. She only took his name eighteen months ago and she is an 'interesting' paradox of conflicts......     urlLink READ THE REST HERE !   -----response------   As they say 'The Devil mixes the truth with lies.' And republicans get so mad at Moore for Fahrenheit 9/11. It makes me so happy to see them have to take their own medicine. The difference between the Heinz/Kerry email and Fahrenheit 9/11 is that Moore bases his opinion on facts. So my question here is, where are the facts?   Here's the bio of the 'hate-monger' Soros, who has given more money to rebuilding some countries in a year than the U.S. as a whole:   'Soros has been active as a philanthropist since 1979, when he began providing funds to help black students attend the University of Cape Town in apartheid South Africa. Today he is chairman of the Open Society Institute (OSI) and the founder of a network of philanthropic organizations that are active in more than 50 countries. Based primarily in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union—but also in Africa, Latin America, Asia, and the United States—these foundations are dedicated to building and maintaining the infrastructure and institutions of an open society. They work closely with OSI to develop and implement a range of programs focusing on civil society, education, media, public health, and human rights as well as social, legal, and economic reform. In recent years, OSI and the Soros foundations network have spent more than $400 million annually to support projects in these and other focus areas. In 1992, Soros founded Central European University, with its primary campus in Budapest.'   Here's the link to the  urlLink G2 Bulletin  The G2 bulletin is actually called 'Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin' and it links from  urlLink www.worlddailynews.com    And on his web site it says, 'Joseph Farah's G2 Bulletin is your independent, online intelligence resource edited and published by the veteran newsman and founder of WorldNetDaily.com. Each week he taps his vast network of international intelligence sources to bring you credible insights into geo-political and geo-strategic developments.'   Who is this guy? Where does he get his info? What makes him an authority? Is he biased?   Where did they get their info on the Tides Foundation. Are we suppose to just take their word for it. I researched the Tides Foundation, and didn't see anything outside of the ordinary. Is there even a Democratic Justice Fund? I looked for it online and the only thing that came up was 100 links to postings of the Heinz/Kerry email I'm writing about. But nothing about the 'Democratic Justice Fund.' Does that fund even exists? If so, let's see some actual facts here.   Yes Heinz is rich, but what about and Bush and Cheney. They come from Oil money. Talk about calling the kettle black. Is oil money not as bad as ketchup money. I can bet if Kerry wins we won't be going to war so that we can keep up a good supply of Ketchup and make Heinz a little richer.   I could go on. Emails like this make me glad that Fahrenheit 9/11 is out and angering republicans and conservatives. They've been slinging half-truths, lies and bile (like the fact-devoid Heinz/Kerry email) for years. Luckily the real facts of Bush are coming out, and no amount of conservative/republican spin is gong to be able to save him. He's in for a bad summer and fall.               ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She was upset when she lost her lover. Yeah, I can feel what she feels now. I'm a sucker for sad songs. Drama me. Maybe I should start getting my act in Korea and be some crying weepy actor? I was literally being identified as one of them (korean) when I was in Seoul - of course I need to really brush up on my verbal skills rather than surviving on this one line 'Han-gugonun mot'amnida' ( Means: I don't understand Korean)  Why has korean fever hit the crowd with so much frenzy? Are we not depress enough already as humans with our own problems? Guess we are just like how the cantonese people would have a saying 'You take sh*t and rub it all over you' ( I don't really know how to spell it in cantonese hehe). Maybe it is an escapism when we see other people being depressed and we can re-assure ourselves we are fine/luckier than those people on the drama serials? Guess we should start experimenting on the housewives who've glued themselves so faithfully to these serials and squeeze out the essence of this attraction.

3560736,Student,"                 I've stated it before, but  urlLink this article reminded me  about it again, we will never create a machine with true artificial intelligence. We may be able to create extremely powerful computers, we may even be able to very cleverly simulate intelligence, but we will never actually create a machine that will be able to be intelligent in the way a human is: creative, sensitive and utterly unique.  I doubt very seriously that we'll even be able to create a computer that could show the same intelligence level of a dog.  Macines will always be nothing but a series of commands entered by a programer. Chess computers are a good example of what I'm talking about. They are very good at what they do, and they are very powerful. However, essentially they are still a product of millions of lines of code entered very carefully that does nothing but analyze every possible outcome of a chess game. They also program in every possible strategy to every possible counter move - they basically program in every effective chess move possible. There is no creativity. You can't program the computer to simply understand the rulesof chess and then say 'go get 'em!' You can't even program it with general guidelines for strategy - well, you can, but anyone with a rudimentary understanding of chess will be able to beat that computer.   Basically, the computer is able to simulate intelligence in a highly specific domain (chess) but only within the prameters that the programmers have accounted for. That is the limitation, the computer cannot create, it can only extrapolate and analyze based on previously entered data and parameters. It simply has more knowledge to pull from than a human opponent and therefore has the ability to beat that human. Now see if it can readily apply, on it's own, the concepts learned in chess and apply them to, say, Risk (a vastly simpler game).   It is an opinion for sure, but experts have been saying we're '10 or 15' years away from artificial intelligence since the 1970's, and they're still saying the same thing. You can bank on it. It will never happen.             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3560517,Technology,"              From Opinion Journal Online.  The 'Mainstream Media' continues to ignore members of the new Iraq government thanking the US and its coalition for liberating their country.  Kevin :-)   Iraqi Gratitude The new government is thanking America and Bush. Why are the media silent?  Tuesday, June 8, 2004 12:01 a.m.  A myth has developed that Iraqis aren't grateful for their liberation from Saddam. So it's worth noting that the leaders of Iraq's new interim government have been explicit and gracious in their thanks, not that you've heard this from the U.S. media. First in Arabic and then in English, Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said in his inaugural address to the Iraqi people last Tuesday that 'I would like to record our profound gratitude and appreciation to the U.S.-led international coalition, which has made great sacrifices for the liberation of Iraq.' In his own remarks, President Ghazi al-Yawer said: 'Before I end my speech, I would like us to remember our martyrs who fell in defense of freedom and honor, as well as our friends who fell in the battle for the liberation of Iraq.'   Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari told the U.N. Security Council much the same thing last Thursday: 'We Iraqis are grateful to the coalition who helped liberate us from the persecution of Saddam Hussein's regime. We thank President Bush and Prime Minister Blair for their dedication and commitment.'  We thought our readers might like to know.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3560517,Technology,"              The media completely ignores the 9/11 chairmen when they question the way the media is portraying the commissions's own findings.  Unbelievable !!!  Kevin   In the “Grapevine” segment on Special Report with Brit Hume, Jim Angle explained:       “9-11 Commission Co-Chairman Lee Hamilton, a Democrat, said today there is no disagreement between the commission and the administration over links between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein. But most news organizations last night said the commission’s conclusion, that there was no quote, ‘collaborative relationship’ between the two was evidence the administration deliberately misled the public. CBS Evening News said the commission quote, ‘directly contradicted one of President Bush’s justifications for going to war against Iraq.’ ABC said the report quote, ‘unequivocally’ disputed the Bush administration’s claims of an al-Qaeda-Iraq link. NBC reported that the commission is ‘sharply at odds with what leading members of the administration continue to claim.’       “A front page headline in today’s New York Times reads quote, ‘Panel Finds No Qaeda-Iraq Tie.’ And the Washington Post says quote, ‘al-Qaeda-Hussein Link is Dismissed.’ But commission members said today there were links, just not a working relationship and no evidence of any Iraqi involvement in September 11th.”   The Republican Chairman and Democratic Vice Chairman of the 9-11 Commission on Thursday rejected the media’s widespread reporting that the commission’s report issued the day before had directly contradicted Bush administration statements about connections between al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. Yet on Thursday night ABC’s Peter Jennings declared that there “continues to be a discrepancy between the commission’s findings and the President’s on whether al-Qaeda has a link to Saddam Hussein,” and CBS anchor Dan Rather repeated how “the commission yesterday said it had found no credible evidence of a quote, 'collaborative relationship’ between al-Qaeda and Iraq.” NBC’s Tom Brokaw reiterated the same no “collaborative relationship” finding. But, Brokaw intoned, “despite that conclusion, President Bush insisted there was a relationship between the two.” NBC buried what should have been its lead. At the very end of his report, David Gregory informed viewers of how “Lee Hamilton said today that he does not see much different between administration statements and the commission’s report.” CNN barely mentioned Hamilton while the New York Times and Washington Post ignored him.

3553589,Banking,"                 I don't watch a lot of television, but what I do watch tends to be at 2 or 3 in the morning.  This enables me to memorize all the different late night commercials jingles.  Why, I don't know.  Is this useful in life?  No, it's not.    One of the commercials that I hate is for the Twin Cities People Store.  Unless you're from the Twin Cities, you have never understood how stupid this commercial is.  It's for a dating service.  Basically there are black and white pictures of people in ballerina dresses and holding mops.  I think it goes, 'Too busy with chores?  And all those dance lessons!  Meet people the old-fashioned way, dial the Twin Cities People Store.  It's an easy way to meet nice people.'  That's the gist of it.  What bothers me about this is the fact that when I think of meeting people the old-fashioned way, I don't think of dialing a phone and listen to 'nice people describe themselves.'  Is this old-fashioned in any way shape or form?  Ugh!  In my book (which doesn't exist but maybe someday), the worst commercial ever was for Quizno's Subs.  It involved these singing things (they looked like hairless rats but I guess they're supposed to be bread - I'll get to that) with horrible voices singing about how bringing in a coupon would get you a dollar off of a sub.  These rat-things would sing (I think I mean scream) 'EAT QUIZNO'S SUBS!  ANY COUPON WORKS' and something about a hair-cut.  The first time I saw this commercial, I sat up and said (probably loudly), 'What was that?!?!?!?!?!?!?'  This commercial did not last long.  Most sane people thought using hairless rats to promote food was not a good plan.  What's even worse is the fact these are supposed to be loaves of bread.  Great!  Now I'm hungry because food is screaming at me to 'EAT ME!'  It's like promoting cannibalism.  I think I would be freaked out if a cow mooed at me, 'I'm tasty.'  (Well, I might freak out after I've sold the cow to a circus because that's just cool.  A talking cow!)  You know the Mattress Giant commercial?  The words never change but if you pay attention you'll notice the pictures change.  My life is so sad.    All of my friends can actually sing the lyrics to the National American University commercial.  You know the one, 'One day, one night, Saturday is alright....'  It's sad.

3552340,indUnk,"        From Stacy :  I am not a Missourian, however, most of my loved ones whether family or friends are from Missouri.  Yesterday’s election on Amendment 2 was more than a joke.  You place a subject on a ballot for the citizens to vote on, yet give very little back ground or pro’s and con’s to the subject.  Next to no publicity on the ballot except for how people feel it is such an abomination to our society.    Why are tax dollars paying an election on meaning of a word (Marriage) and its definition in the Constitution, not to mention the tax dollars to take the effort to actually change it!!  It is not clear and apparent that everyone who has skin and bones are equal in the US and not to be discriminated against?  Was there not already laws prohibiting legal marriage?  Is it not clear that we are all tax paying citizens also and it has nothing to do with color, race, creed, or religion?? It is not clear that two people who have planned a life together whether it is a man and a woman or two of the same sex is done with love and caring.  Think back to when it was frowned on blacks and whites to hang out, use the same fountain, go to school together or for a black person to so much as look at a white person in the eyes- now they are MARRYING each other!!!!  What is the difference?  Maybe someone should take the time to put on the ballot to change the meaning of the word PREJUDICE!!!  Just when you would think we are finally getting past all the prejudice in America!  This is a sad day!!  Mayor Barnes can put all her time and effort into LOOKS of a new downtown Missouri, but not once show any support for ALL and I mean ALL her people, including ones who voted for her!  One lady who owns a bar in Missouri, has a picture of her with Mayor Barnes and is soooooooo proud of her and all she stands for and guess what---this friend is GAY!!  This picture is in a predominately GAY bar!!  Again where was any support for the PEOPLE?  We are all human, with love, compassion, responsibilities, tax paying, hard working and living normal lives.  Yes, be proud of your new arena; be ashamed of the results for Amendment 2.  There could have been more support publicized.  Such a large subject that last for a life time and such little attention compared to some building going up which probably had thousands of dollars in how many advertisements?  How about Amendment 1—the gambling?  How much was spent on that ballot?   I have a “wife” and we got married in your state and now I regret the location that we chose.  I will never regret the love and affection I have for her and her entire loving and supportive family!!!  We had more than two hundred family, fellow workers and friends attend without prejudice!!  What a glorious day!!  We had discussed moving to Missouri on several occasions, but I refuse to do so now.   Are you all so worried that two people of the same sex building a life together with children are a threat to society to actually legally be married?  Do not the children of these homes deserve the recognition and benefits of two loving parents?  If I were to pass away some day, is my spouse who spent 20 plus years with me deserving of my benefits or do you really think the government is?   From Jill:   I really hadn't been following closely the vote in Missouri because I figured it had NO way of passing. I based my assumption on the fact that the good citizens of  your state had rejected John Ashcroft's Senate candidacy four years ago, choosing to vote for a dead man over a living 'Christian'  reactionary who was afraid of calico cats.I will say, as an aside, that I no longer believe in the concept of 'marriage'. I think ALL unions - both gay and straight - should be civil unions with the couples going to a religious entity if they want to be religiously blessed as 'marriage'. But that's not the issue here.But I do think you two have a couple of choices. You can stay and fight the idiocy as voted into law or you can pull up stakes from KC and move to a more gay-friendly area.  I hope you stay and fight - although sometimes we all just become too tired and discouraged to put up with crap in our lives.If this is the Missouri gay community's Stonewall, well, then so be it.I think Jon touches on some good issues. Years ago I heard of a tactic that was used by the gay community of a city to show just how important the dollars of the community was to the economy at large. (I can't remember what city it was but I think it would work well in a smaller, less liberal city than, say, NYC or SF).  Anyway, each dollar bill spent by  shoppers was marked with 'This is a dollar spent by a member of the gay community'. You could probably get many straight 'friends and family' to do this as well.  I know it sounds crackpot - and I wish I could remember where I read about it - but it worked very well.  Actually, come to think of it, it could work nationwide.And, what about court challenges? Has anyone contacted the ACLU?Bush's reelection will cause horrendous problems for all liberals, or even, non-conservatives. His next term in office will see the resignation and appointment of three Supreme Court judges. We can't allow this to happen. The next four years will be a living hell that will take decades to recover from if we allow Bush to be reelected. There are many 'voices to be heard' in our attempt to take back our America.  Just know that there are many straights out there who are sympathetic and will help you if we can.  Let me know.  Jill   From Mark:   I have been out all day and didn't get my e-mail until just now. I want to write something on my blog, but I don't know what to write. Welcome to my testing ground... I worked from 6 in the morning until about 8:45 last night for the Wyandotte County Election Office. I enjoyed the work and had a relatively good day. I got home last night and turned on the news to see how my friend Jason Klumb was doing for the state treasurer dealy-bob. That and I was concerned about the Holden/Whats-her-name dealy-bob. I should interject: I was sure Amendment 2 was going to pass. I'm not so naive as to think a majority of voting Missourians care about any homosexual they might know in their life... however, when the screen popped up with '70% Yes, 30% No', I was floored. I figured it would be '60% Yes' at best. I was (and still am) disgusted. I'm frightened. I'm angry. I'm lots of thing. I don't want to spend any more time in Missouri than I absolutely have to, and I am determined not to spend any money in Missouri (which is going to make bowling an issue, guys). Will Missouri miss my money? I'd guess not. But if I had to choose between taking my business to someone who at least treated me as an equal and someone who apparently views me as less-than-human, it wouldn't be a lengthy debate in my skull. Is Kansas any better? Well, they're not the First State of Hate, for one thing. Attempts to constitutionalize bigotry and hatred have failed in Kansas... but, again, I'm not naive--or at most I'm only naive enough to think Missouri would top out the 'Yes' votes at 60%--I figure Kansas will get around to it soon enough. Work-wise, the plan is to no longer teach in Missouri after my contract is up at the end of this upcoming school year. If things don't go downhill super-fast in Kansas, I figure I'll teach on this side of the state line... maybe. I'm thinking about going back out to California, or--depending on what happens in November--checking out the possibility of teaching in Canada. Maybe even citizenship. What can I say? I'm not a fighter. Or maybe I am a fighter, but I fight myself every day just to have the will to deal with everything I've set myself up to deal with... and the stuff I didn't set myself up to deal with (except in that I was born at the wrong time, in the wrong nation, with the 'wrong' sexual preference). I don't think I have the fight for this sort of thing. Maybe for no sort of thing any more. I think it would be nice living in a country that didn't spend my formative years trying to convince me what a great a free country we live in, where everyone has the same opportunities... when in truth: not so much. Somehow this has made me not want to talk to my straight friends at all. I keep thinking how it's no skin off their noses. I keep thinking how easy it would have been for them at the ballot box to think, 'gee, maybe I really DO want this to pass'. Or, for the ones who live in Kansas, how they might secretly feel this was the right thing to happen. I know this is irrational. But I lost my 'Rational Club' membership years ago. I spoke to one of my straight married female friends tonight on the phone when I got home from work... and she's a great person, and I'm sure she voted against it, but she didn't seem to understand my feelings about this. I just wanted to scream into the phone, 'Let's put YOU on the sub-human list, and see if you feel like singing and dancing with a tra-la-la and a whoop-dee-do!' But then I figured the last part would make it sound funnier than I meant it to. Short version (for those of you who thought to skip to the bottom to see if there is a short version): I'm done. I'm outta here. I'm not going to MO unless I have to. I do enough to make myself feel like crap... I don't need any help from a state's constitution, thanks. Mark   More From Stacy:   I am aware that the amendment does not mention a gay marriage ban, but what is the difference between saying that and defining it between one man and one woman.  As far as Massachusetts, yes they fought for common wealth and the right to claim each other as one union- not to be discriminated against for sexual reasons or preference or life style, but for those who “actually” love each other and are not just running to the altar to make a statement.   I am one of those who will only do it for the right reasons.  That is what the frustration is.  Massachusetts is heavily populated with alternative life style living folks, and I am sure some- not all did tie the knot to make a statement more than for reasons of love.  Why should that be such an issue?  Why would our President want to deprive us of rights for benefits due to anyone when we are all equal in the eyes of God?  I was raised in a very religious home and went to a Christian school.  I love God and try earnestly to live a good hard working loyal life to myself, God, my family and my friends.  What would it truly hurt that we are treated equally?  Why make is such a law that it is ever forbidden to be recognized as anything other than sub-human because we choose a different path?  Julie and I want to have children and are scared to death of the “what if this happens” down the road to one of us. What battles we have to fight for a family would is not fair for folks living in the US.  I am glad that the Federal level denied the change.  It simply stated is one word for our anguish- “equality”.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I woke up at 9 and got up and 9:30 which was when my parents told me that we were going to yumcha and were leaving now. This prompted me to get dressed and cleaned in something like 10 minutes (and a pretty good job i'd say). I won't go into why we were going to yumcha on Sunday because it'll take too long. Let's just say it involves my grandmother who is staying here at the moment. Due to track work in the city, we caught a bus to central (again don't ask why we were eating in central).  The first sign of trouble was when we got there and noticed quite a large crowd of people standing outside the yumcha place. This turned out to be people waiting for a table. Now we had to wait for a table and we waited...and waited...and waited and pretty soon i was quite pissed off and bored because i was hungry as i missed breakfast and i brought nothing to do. After an hour i rang andy out of pure boredom and talked to him from a payphone in the middle of this waiting crowd (note: if anybody ever wants to be a person i call out of pure boredom please leave a name plus number). By now i have a fat headache caused by loud random noise caused by annoyed people. Then i get pulled off the phone because we finally get a table. So i'm eating with a large headache still with lots of noise. Not good. When we finished we went to Chinatown etc. all the asian places asian people go in the city. I was travelling along in a kinda drugged trance due to headache. When we got home at 4 i went straight to bed and i just woke up.

3547891,indUnk,"       I think I mentioned earlier that I want to go to the writers conference in Surrey. This means I need to raise 400 dollars by October. My July allowance will likely be spent in Ontario (if I'm cheap then maybe not, but we'll assume it is). That gives me August, September and October which is $120. I can probably clean Papa's house four times which is another $40. I can probably get 20 bucks from mom for business stuff. That gives me $180. I'll have at least $20 dollars left after Ontario so I'm at 200. That's only half. Either I have to convince my parents to pay half or do something else.   My aunt Cathy just offered me babysitting for this summer. Cathy is at school and she'll need daycare for her two kids. She's a welfare single mom so I don't expect great amounts. I'm so busy that I'll only be able to do it 4 weeks and there would be once a week that I'm volunteering at the hospital and couldn't do it. So that's 16 days for like 8 hours a day. Let's say she pays me 5 bucks an hour (I deserve more but let's assume lower rather than higher). Fourty a day times 16 days is 640. Wow. That's like more than enough. I'm really going to try to take her up on that. I'm not sure what mom will say.   I could also offer to do more chores for more money. But the baby sitting will work much better. I really hope she's all right with that.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's way out in Center Point.  As we reached the 'One mile to Center Point' sign, the car began to slow.  My dad pulled onto the shoulder of the highway and the car continued to slow.  Finally, it came to a halt.  My dad got out of the car and checked the engine.  He tried to restart it several times, but we got nothing.  We got out to walk.  We had walked only ten feet when a car pulled over in front of us.  A man with rugged features and bristly stubble all over his chin got out of his truck and walked towards us.  His face was dirt-smudged but kindly.  He offered us the use of his cell phone and gave us a ride to Joensy's.  (And my mom said not to get into a car with a stranger!)  He told us that they had had a car that broke down once, and they took it in to fix, but it kept breaking down every so often for about six months, until they gave in and got rid of it.  He was awfully chatty.  He told us all about his wife and kids.  So here was this man we had never met before who stopped to help, just because we knew what we were going through.  That's kindness.   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp We ate our supper and called a friend of ours to come rescue us.  My dad waited for the tow truck, which would only tow the car five miles before charging, so they went to the auto repair shop near Center Point.  My mom and my sister went to fetch my dad.  Now the car is dead.  Our good ol' Hyundai that served us so well.  But that's what happens when you buy a used car, I guess.  Poor thing.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've already spoken about the '45mphconstantlius' subspecies of village speeder, and I never stop complaining about the juvenile speeder who doesn't know any better.  But it seems to me that everyone goes faster than 30mph through villages. I always end up with a train of tailgaters behind. Aren't they bothered about killing someone?  As far as I am concerned it is simply a display of aggression and disrespect towards locals. It's like their actions are saying, 'fuck you! I don't care if I   do   run your children over.' And where I come from that is fighting talk.  I am considering changing all the road signs in our area that point towards the M1 so that: a) either they all point in a huge circle, and after say 7 miles the driver who follows the roadsigns finds himself back where he started (actually most people wouldn't notice that and would circle forever or until they ran out of fuel). Or; b) make the signs point down a narrow country lane that gets narrower and narrower (making turning round impossible) with, at the end, a very muddy field so that all the cars get stuck in it, like mammoths in a prehistoric tarpit.

3539224,Student,"                 I arrive on the Campus of Ashland University at 1pm to register so i can find my room and building. i was assigned to Clark Hall, my city was Davidson, and my counties name is Holcshuh. I waited for my roommate for the longest time and she never came for a long long time, but at like almost 2:30ish i met her. My roommates name is Sarah Balney, she is a great/amazing person. i had soo much fun talking to her and hanging out with her the whole time we were there on the first day. we then had a meeting in our city hall to meet n greet all the girls who were selected to go to girls state. it was a great privalage to have such an amazing city and to have great friends. we walked into the room as strangers and we will walk out as best friends, the week we spent together will be remembered forever, since it was a great privilage to be selected for such a great thing. We then explored the campus with our city, *Z* showes us where things were and where to find everything. after that we ate dinner with our cities, and we then had a bond to each other, i then started to hang out with nicole, krysta and bridget. at 8 pm we all went as a city to the upper convo room to have our opening ceremony, it was kind of boring but i guess u'll have that sometimes. after we had our opening ceremony we started to form our businesses and have some fun. it was a great day n it had soo many memories, i'm glad that i got a chance to go to this.

3532939,Government,"       Well Folks out in Blogger land I have to let you all know about one of the best weekends I've had in months. It all started on Friday after work...I went home and cleaned up a bit (shaved, edged myself upp, washed my hair) then I went to my hair braiders house and she hooked me up...;o) After I got the braids fresh I went over to my man's house and we started to drink...man I tell you some dominoes, Paul Masson, a few J's and we were lit...lol...we strolled in the club around 1:30am fully lit and ready to party...When i stepped in the club things were different...I mean normally I know everyone that's in there but that night there had to be all sorts of new faces...I really don't remember too much but I do remember dancing with all sorts of women...I swear I was being passed around from friend to friend....all of them telling me how cute I am ( like it's something I haven't heard before) After the dancing carousel I had to get me another drink...but I had a basketball game in about 6 or 7 hours so I had to make it a light one...Heineken Brew...;o) Needless to say I don't know what time I left the club or where we went afterwards but I do remember waking up at 10am feeling brand new! I had a basketball tournament in Nieder-Ulm (which is about an hour from me) Our first game was really sloppy...only 6 people showed up (I'd say about 5 out of the 6 were still pretty hungover) and we had to play a pretty good team...needless to say we lost that game...but we lost in overtime playing 5 on 3 ( 2 players fouled out and I was one of them) so we ended up losing by 5 points...oh well first game....had to shake some rust off...I had 9 points and 13 rebounds...  the second game was a lot better...the competition was a lot better which made us play better ...we won the game 63-51...I posted 14points, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks, and 4 assists. not bad since I was still recovering from the hangover and I fouled out (once again) Well after that game we had a long break..so you know ya boy went straight to the car and took a power nap...afterwards we decided to go ahead and eat a bit. We had some sort of steak...man all I can say is that it wass off the chain...I had like 3 of them. As we were eating a few women from one of the girls teams that were there came over to sit with us...they were cool and we found out one of them used to play ball at URI (University of Rhode Island) She really wasn't that cute but it was good to see another American out there...Well we headed to our third game of the day and when we got to the court I almost died laughing...the competition was a joke...they didn't have a guy over 6 foot...lol....so you know I had to take advantage...man I felt like Shaq out there...I'd say it was pretty good until about half way through the first half when one of my teammates shot the ball missed and I caught the rebound and dunked all over there star player...I'm talking nuts in his face tye of dunk...lol..after that he sat down and never came back in the game...we won 88-42 by far the worst ass kicking in the whole tournament...it would have been a lot worse but we were playing around trying to make up dunks and missed a bunch of shots....I had 27 points, 22 rebounds 7 blocks, 9 assists. Well that sums up day one....I'll be back to give you the scoop on what happened that night and the following days when i return from lunch!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3525160,indUnk,"           ...I decided to braindump without care... with caution to the wind... how very brave of me... I am so proud.  The display of the inner workings of the human mind is complex, and most often quite depressing.  This is, at least, what I gather from it all.  Blogs have taught me this.  And it is the written word, so no matter how you sugarcoat it and make it palatable, somewhere along the line something will be incorrectly perceived and processed.  I wonder how many 'friendships' have gone to the wall due to these blogs.  Or just relationships as a whole.  Are Gallup and Zogby busy, per chance?  So today I want to be thankful.  Thankful for my parents doing their best and not abusing me physically, and thankful that I understand my mother didn't mean the psychological things that manifested themselves.  Thankful for having been able to sing in a band, play baseball, do theater work... and various other activities that I have enjoyed over the years.  Thankful that I found a seemingly stable relationship with someone whom I greatly admire as a human being.  Thankful that she helped introduce me and the world to a couple of pretty swell rugrats.  Thankful that I have witnessed so much history and historical places in my lifetime.  I have stood on the hill at Carthage.  I have lived within the remnants of the Warsaw Ghetto.  I have walked through Brandenburg Gate.  (BTW... thanks, Mr. Gorbachev and friends)  I have walked inside a Roman Colloseum.  I have been delayed at Heathrow.  I have crossed St. Charles' Bridge.  I have sat at a bar drinking the original Budweiser (from the Czech Republic) while discussing the history of Central Europe with a variety of characters too diverse to divulge.  Not too shabby for a boy from Arkansas who was too lazy and caught up in life to complete college.  Who'da thunk it?  So, like I said, since no one reads me anyway... I can be reminiscientally thoughtful without concern for being misconstrued as being bragadocious.  I sure could have had it all a lot worse...         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3520378,Technology,"        Tonight's adventure was sponsored, in part, by Zebrahead.    Bj, Wolf and I made the obligatory appearance at a great rock show at the House of Blues.  It sure is nice to be able to kick it with a good band on a Wednesday night in the city!  They were decent as usual, the lead singer always puts on a hilarious performance.  But going to these rock shows, especially ones like Zebrahead, sure do make me feel old.  A 25 year old is an old man at these shows, where the majority of the crowd is in HS.  I probably threw stuff at people that were as old as me when I was their age.  And whoever got hit probably deserved it.  A good old fashioned punk (though poppy) show doesn't need someone slaving for the man screwing up their atmosphere.  Ha!  Fuck it, I always have a good time at those things.  I like to think I will continue with a decent concert schedule for at least a few more years.  Probably until they won't let me in when they see my ID.  They'll probably think I'm a narc.  Probably already do.  Shit, it really doesn't seem  that  long ago when Stevenson, Bob and I were jamming at our first Foo Fighters show at the Riviera, it was.......MY GOD it was over 8 years ago.  1996.  Shit.  That shit was fantastic: getting that nervous, thrilling, spine-tingling feeling when the band that I was watching was up there ripping ass up, and that was my only thought and concern in the world.  It's always been a huge release for me, seeing a rock show with my friends.  Quite drug like.  And now I'm holding on for dear life, hoping that my friends don't drop out before I feel it's time.  But I think that time is approaching, since I have to almost beg most of them to go see a band that I want to see.  Ah, c'est la vie.  It was bound to happen sometime.

3517063,Student,"       During my freshman year of college, an old high school buddy dragged me to see a rerelease of the movie the Big Chill. To this day, it remains one of my all-time favorite movies.  The Big Chill is a U of M story - it directly references Michigan football, Ann Arbor and other facets of U of M life that I profoundly miss.  And in some ways it encapsulates my friendships. Only, over the years, what I saw as my role has changed. First, I was Alex, the suicide victim (originally supposed to be played as a corpse by Kevin Costner). Then I was Nick. No longer. First of all, I'm really not a Vietnam vet, and I'm not impotent. Still, there's so much of my friendships in this movie.  Part of me has been hoping since I first saw this movie that I'd never be in this situation. That I'd never have to see how my friends' lives had changed, that I'd never have to go to a friend's funeral. Today, I see it more objectively. I know we're all going to change. And for the most part, it's for the better. And someone will die, and we'll get over it, and grow stronger because of it. Some of us will grow distant. Some of us will grow closer. And whatever happens, we'll always have Ann Arbor.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3516981,Environment,"                 Ok, it was a huge day so I'll start at the beginning:  Like most days the 6am drive into the block turned into a full-on redneck 'muddin' fest.  I got in early and ran into a bunch of guys just coming from the last block and didn't know the way into this one.  They all followed me in and then all got stuck in the one bad hole in the road.  2 chocker chains and some 'everybody jump in the back of the 2wd' genius and we had them out.  No big deal just now I'm super dirty.  We walked into the back of the strip we'd started the night before and I fired up my saw... funny something seems weird.  I started noticing tons of play in the throttle and then my throttle wasn't working at all.. GREAT.  I walked my saw back out to the road because working with small parts in the middle of a slash pile is a great way to loose parts; expensive imported from Germany Stihl parts.  Once I got to the road I tore the whole saw apart except and found that the problem had to be in the trigger assembly.  Low and behold the trigger assembly uses a smaller torx bit than the rest of the saw.  I spent a while walking up and down the road looking for someone to borrow tools from but everyone had disappeared.  Our block is only a little ways from the saw shop so I packed up and headed in to get some professional repairs.  Long story turned short the throttle cable had broken inside the trigger assembly and needed to be replaced.  30mins and every employee in the shop looking on had the problem fixed and, lucky me, it was under warranty.  I got back to the block and my partner had just about finished the strip we were on ( I think I mentioned that this stuff was creamy ) so we got it done and then .. REDNECK MUD FEST!  yup..  noontime and another truck to get unstuck, this time I did the honours and 3 BIG tugs got another ranger out of the hole and we just about took his bumper with it.  I got a Tim Horton's Cappuccino for the rescue effort .. STOKED!  The day was going great.. it was 2:30 and we were just about done the strip we were in so we decided to claim another for the morning to minimize the chance that too many guy show up and get an unwanted 'break'  But as we walked up the road it became apparent that there was some kind of uproar in the thinning community....  Papers, if the checker (who works for the forestry marketing board ) fails your strip you get papers.  A strip could fail for a million reasons: too many trees cut, not enough trees cut, wrong kind of trees cut or not cut, trees laying in place they shouldn't be, stumps too high... whatever.  EVERYONE had papers... except us.  We decided not to 'claim' another strip, which is kind of frowned upon just incase we had in-fact received papers.  If you get papers you have to drop everything and go back to the offending strip and fix whatever it is your paper says in wrong.  I tip toed up to the truck and peeked into the cab.... no papers! We were happy but not quite convinced since seasoned vets had got papers and really, their quality is better than ours.  We stopped into the office on the way home to get our pay stubs and low and behold we go a paper too.  A single paper is no big deal and we can get it fixed up in one tanks of gas each but shit.. you don't make any money dicking around fixing stuff that's already been cut.  And to the checker that failed us.. screw your mother, your grandmother and the horse you rode in on! and.. uh..  um.....          Your favorite band sucks!

Isn't it nice to know that there are  urlLink people out there thinking  about topics like this?? :-)  I found his statement that we are 'only prisoners of of our past choices' to ring true.  You may have noticed that I was also delving into the idea of choice (problem solving) in my last  urlLink post .  For some reason, it's been on my mind lately.  It just seems to me that we all get caught up in a fatalistic view of our lives.  We tell ourselves that we can't do this or that, or we 'have to' do something, when what we really need is to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps and get in gear.  Our own mental wishing and negativity seem to prevent this from happening.  Take me, for example.  I  urlLink whine and moan  to myself inside my head. 'I should give up  urlLink smoking  for good.' 'I should  urlLink exercise  more.' 'I should  urlLink eat to fuel  my body.' 'I should  urlLink date  more girls.'  You get the idea.

3507455,Education,"             By most accounts - some could even argue by all accounts - my life is far from successful. My problems are many and varied. I am with out gainful employment. My hairline is receding. I live with my parents. I have no luck with women - this, of course, could be a result of the rest of my problems. I am very clumsy, often annoying, and love bad hair bands of the 1980's - however, I can't stand good hair bands of the 1980's, although I can't say I've ever heard of any.  &nbsp;  Now, I am aware that I do have some good qualities. Those with an incredible gift of perception may even be able to notice some of them. I am fairly well read, more or less intelligent and occasionally amusing. I'm a good listener, in many ways unselfconscious, and I make great omelets. Also, I love bad hair bands of the 1980's.  &nbsp;  My major problem, I have decided, is that I lack a certain force of will, strength of commitment, courage, intestinal fortitude, balls, etc. I live too much of my life inside of my own head. I lack the strength, desire, or bravery to move ideas out of the intellectual realm and into the physical, everyday realm. I cannot realize my full potential, because - through either fear or apathy - I cannot make myself fully responsive to the world at large. I need to move beyond myself. Take the strength of my mind and apply it to the world. I need to develop my intellectual and social courage in much the same way I have developed my body from flabby to almost ok. I need to gain some strength. I need machismo. I need to jump out of my seat, run out into the street with the crazed look of a blind man who can suddenly see. I need to experience and I need to do. I need to grab life by the lapels, shake it around, and generally make it my woman. In short, I need a mustache.  &nbsp;  Ah, yes, the mustache: the facial hair of the man of action. Mustaches practically breath decisiveness. Quick, think of the mustache. Who comes to mind? Clark Gable. Magnum PI. Rollie Fingers. Cowboys. Every hero of every 70's cop movie or television show. Barber shop quartets. Porn stars. Groucho Marx. Every state trouper. All men of action. Men who know who they are, know what they want, and get it. That is the power of the mustache.  &nbsp;  So, is it any wonder that I, weak willed as I am, long for a mustache, would treasure a mustache, would comb it thrice daily, would wax the ends into intricate curly-Q's. I quake with desire for a mustache. I have started growing one. I picture it in my minds eye, thick and full, flowing down the corners of my mouth, covering my upper lip in a luxurious facial hair canopy of manhood. I see myself on job interviews, employers falling all over themselves to have me be a part of their company. 'By George,' they'll say, 'just take a gander at that magnificent mustache. We must employ that man. Quick get the benefits package together.' I can see myself at the bars and the clubs. I can see the women swooning over me. 'By George,' they'll say, 'look at that mustache. He is clearly more man than the rest of these bare lipped fools. Quick, we must go lavish feminine attention upon him.'  &nbsp;  I am growing my mustache. It is currently little more than stubble at the moment. I am sure that I will have to withstand the horrible, 'I think a caterpillar died on your upper lip' stage of mustache growth, the stage which most men cannot progress past. I know that some people are going to sneer and mock my mustache. 'By George,' they'll say, 'You look like a pervert (or a pedaphile, or a member of the village people, or Teddy Roosevelt).' I can handle this. I will simply laugh it off, because I know - deep down I just know - that mustaches are kick ass, and those losers are only jealous of the power and the majesty that is the mustache.  &nbsp;  I also know that some people are skeptical. Not so much toward the power of the mustache - which is undeniable - but toward my ability to handle responsibly the greatness of the mustache. These people may argue that you must first have the mustache attitude then the mustache follows naturally. That to grow the mustache and then hope for the attitude is a fools errand. 'By George,' they are probably saying, 'this chap's mustache will surely wither and die upon his lip. The attitude predicates the mustache, not vice verse.' Now, this is a very interesting question. It has a number of philosophical facets dealing as it does with issues of causality, individuality, and personality. So, I must be careful in addressing this objection. However, I feel that I am up to the challenge. So, to these people I say: EAT IT!! I'm growing a mustache and that's all there is to it. The mustache is going to be kick ass and so am I. If you losers can't handle that, you better shut up and get out of my way. Because, by George, I'm growing a mustache and I'm coming through. There is no stopping me now. Nothing can stand in the way of the mustache. Nothing......Unless, of course, my mom doesn't like it.  &nbsp;  Shalom            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3503162,Student,"           An interesting and enjoyable snow trip, more enjoyable for some than others.    So from the start.  We were waiting in a wet and rainy Sydney on a monday arvo. Arthur came along to see farewell and pickup some 'magazines' and to see if he could offload his prize of his competition to anybody. Anyways this dingy and small mini-van pulls over. We jokingly say thats our bus, it in fact was our bus. So we had to get on this packed mini-van, packed that we just had enough seats and we had to put some luggage on the inside corridors. That was pretty povo.  Nothing much happened on the bus because everbody was pretty tired with the exception of this guy and girl that diddnt talk non-stop all the way and the guy had this insidious laugh that grated everybody's nerves. Also we learnt later that the trailer at the back in fact was to fall apart, would had been a classic to see it fall apart on the highway. Oh yeah who could forget the cool wind at the back of the bus!  So we arrived at Cooma to hire some gear and meet up with Lewis and then it was straight to Kookaburra lodge. We arrived at around 1:30-2 with the entire trip taking 9hrs for some reason. Diddn't really matter what time we made it anyways since it was hard to sleep with the snoring symphony playing. With 8 guys in the room, it sure was going to get messy.  The next day we were treated with breakfast with strickly no seconds allowed and we got on the bus where we introduced to the workings of an eccentric person. This person would usually talk to himself or sometimes to others in pretty gay fashion, diddnt mind using his hands either. Anyways it was snow time where most of us picked up the 'skills' we aquired last time around, except me. We creamed the beginner lesson and it was off to the bars. Can't believe we diddnt go on any bars last time because it was quite fun, only because I diddnt crash....much, well not too much. After intially not being able to make it to the first post we got the hang of it and in no time we were up the slope ready to plunge down into people. On one run I was sliding into the tree and had to pull out but on the path of the pullout was a tree which I had to fully duck to avoid. Feeling pumped up about my close call, I stacked it 5 seconds later.  After a tiring and enjoyable first day at the snow it was time to get back to the lodge where we had an hour to get showered and ready for dinner. Well the logistics were a bit weird with like 30 guys sharing 5 showers and having 60mins to all shower. Lets say some had a certain Eau de Natural on them. Oh yeah Kirit had a cold shower because he thought there was no hot water when in fact the tap names were switched around!  Dinner was an upgraded version of bizzos. The food was so good and filling that some of us couldnt finish it. It was so good Kenny left a plate full! Desserts which nobody wanted was pretty interesting especially the Chocolate moouse (sp?) which had an onion topping. Nice combination to be had there.   Back to the lodge for chillout and sleep. There we learnt tricks like 'Pickup Cards' and 'Could you put your hand in my pants and get the wallet out of my pants because my hands are full'. It was all good as we watched Dodgeball and the White Chick which was a crowd favourite.   Day two at the snow and we diddnt have a lesson till 1 so we did some runs including a chairlift run with me not knowing how to get off and stacking it at the entrance and on the first run I even got off early and was boarding onto the wooden floor! The run down was pretty fustrating with not knowing the course and having to skate across some flat areas. Kenny ran into a tree branch causing it to snap and Kirit full ran into him from behind! I got snowballed pretty badly by Kirit and Eric while I was just standing there, cheeky fellows! We had level two lessons which I couldnt do for jack because I suck pretty bad with toe edge so everytime I did it I ended up in the path of the T-bar. I had a pretty bad crash while I was following Eric in his speed trap. It was just a bit too much and I fell and jolted my head on the ground. Lost my goggles earlier on so that sucked.  The supposed free beer and pub crawl never eventuated so we went for dinner at some italian place which was pretty generous with its servings. One guy was meticolous in his approach to eating food, cutting a single bean 10 times. We spent the night playing hacky-sack which was pretty fun and taking some 'special photos' which may or may not be on Kenny's website. Later it was time for drinks at the Jindabyne hotel which was pretty packed. After that it was off to Banjos or was it the place next to it. Played some streetfighter which I sucked pretty bad at it and we played some of table soccer game I forgotten the name for. Kenny just told me its called foosball. Just like real life I left it more goals than I scored and I even got some own goals! We played some crappy games on the touch screen and it was back to lodge for some sleep.   from kenny : I forgot to mention that there was this games/recreation room across the cabins which had this strange smell. It wasnt until later that we found it was some underground facility for which the asian guys used to make rice in their portable ricecookers and also to make instant noodles.  Third and final day of the snow and people were a little worse for wear. We did some runs with one memorable run when I was mimicing Kenny down the slope and he stacked it. Well the last movement he was doing was a horizontal board so I ran over him with the board sideways, clipping his board and stacking it fast first. Good one Kenny! I dogged the level 3 lessons to teach some of Thomas' friends how to snowboard. Only one was willing to listen and no suprises that he was the only one that was getting the hang of it! One of them full plundged at full speed, diddnt even bother to chicken out into this little kid. Pretty bad stack and the instructor that was with the kid full on told the guy off. They sucked pretty bad at going up the J-bar with one stacking it pretty early on and he diddnt even let go of the bar even when he was on the ground getting dragged by the bar. Everybody was like screaming out for him to let go but he was holding on for his dear life.   After the day at the snow it was time to head off back to Sydney. Back at the lodge we were told we couldnt use to toilet which was pretty gay to say the least.                       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have not obeyed the commands, decrees and laws you gave your servant Moses.  8 'Remember the instruction you gave your servant Moses, saying, 'If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations, 9 but if you return to me and obey my commands, then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my Name.'  10 'They are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand. 11 O Lord, let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name. Give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man.'   I was cupbearer to the king.   What comes first, a prayer or a need? There are things we instantly go to God in prayer for, things that we know prayer is the best solution for. Family problems, financial difficulties, death, these are things an average teenager might need help with. Prayer's the best we can do, when nothing we do appears to be any good.  Nehemiah knew the needs of the Israelites, and recognized prayer as being the best thing to do. In the story, God didn't give what was asked immediately (it took four months before Nehemiah was granted what he asked). I guess everyone can identify with this. Or at the very least, the wait.  This can be fustrating, especially for teens (God knows we're a pampered lot) who're so used to getting what we want. Yeah, there're always lessons stressing the importance of praying according to God's will. I doubt God will answer my brother's prayer to blow up our school. But I think there's more than that.  I can remember many things I've prayed for (some way more important than others) that only got answered after some time. It would've been nice to have gotten what I needed when I asked for it, but that's the attitude alot of us have. We want what we want when we want it. What we fail to recognize is God's infinite smartness in knowing what's best for us. Often times we're going to have to wait for prayer to be answered, but God being so wonderful, we should trust his timing as well as it's probably the best for us.  Nehemiah waited, and got what he prayed for. I guess sometimes we just need to have faith that God's will  AND  timing are way more precise than ours. Basically, pray faithfully and wait faithfully.   Not my will be done, but God's and according to his clock.  Your friend, Kevin*         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3500871,Student,"                 Okay, so I went to my sister's graduation today (God, did she ever look gorgeous.She honestly shone). And my dad dropped me off at home afterwards, like I said. And so no one is home, so I figure it wouldn't be a problem to strip out of the frickin hot dress I had been wearing in my living room. But just as I get it off, I realize the door's open and my cat is leaping outside, happily. Now, the thing is... My cat is an indoor cat. She's not supposed to be outside. And so, not thinking, I run outside after my cat in my under garments. My cat leads me across the side of my house, and into my neighbour's yard. I honestly wasn't even thinking, but I grabbed my cat, and turned to go inside when I noticed my neighbour's WHOLE family sitting on the back porch. Since when are they home that early, I think. But it turns out it's 6:30 and they were all set on having a nice barbecue in their scenic backyard. So I waved, smiled, then went back inside.  Oh man. I'm an interesting one.

3497616,indUnk,"       Ah, chatting with Rose does me no end of good. It was during this chat that this particular subject came up. Corporal punishment for the purposes of behaviour correction.   Having had rather 'untraditional' D/s relationships, the first time I heard of someone being caned for 'corrective' purposes, I really had a bad reaction to it. The case in question was one where the submissive had been bad-tempered and rude. The solution was a caning. Both the submissive and the Dominant agreed.  I have to be honest and say that it was hard for be even to get my head around this intellectually. Because to me, it inferred an infantalization of the submissive that I found very hard to take. We have two consenting adults here, both are fully formed grown-ups. Submissives are not the only ones who have hissy fits. When a Dom has one, who corrects the Dom?   My inability to get my head around this is one of the major reasons for not indulging in a 24/7 relationship. Everyone throws a fit now and then and I believe everyone has the right to - plus, sometimes, they are warranted! No one can be perfectly even-tempered all the time...nor is it healthy to do it. The suppression of legitimate anger is neither psychologically nor physically healthy.   Certainly, there are better and worse ways to let off steam. Taking it out on the person you love most is not the best way to do it. But what I notice in a lot of 'behaviour correction' situations, is that the sub is not getting any direction on how to channel that anger somewhere safe, less harmful to the relationship or useful. They're just getting punished for showing it at all. And this worries me - for the mental health of the people involved.   I have a bad temper. I get angry - sometimes for very good reasons. I have, over time, learned to channel it away from people I care about by removing myself from their presence or saying: 'Look, I am in an awful mood right now, please give me about half-an-hour, and I will be fine.' And thirty minutes later, I AM fine. I've dealt with it properly, and I'm ready to be socially acceptable again.  As I said earlier, I have never had a 24/7 D/s relationship. And this has allowed me to put myself in the right headspace, get rid of all my shit, and turn up for my Dom in a mindset that will be good for both of us.  I can SEE the attraction, the comfort, the totality of being in a 24/7 D/s relationship. And now I can even, if only theoretically, see the point of this type of behavioral correction. I just don't think I could do it without having my personality disappear.  So...what do  you think? Do you? Don't you?      urlLink Read more!          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3497616,indUnk,"       We've kind of meandered around this discussion before: what's a REAL sub, who's a REAL dom, is 24/7 lifestyle the ONLY way to really be in a TRUE D/s relationship. And that's just peek over the edge into a pretty foetid cauldron of smugly held opinions... And please, nobody even MENTION anarchism.  I do it. I do it without thinking and without wanting to hurt or label someone. I didn't set out to pigeon-hole them when I called them a pain-slut, or a sadist or a doormat. Because it is quite possible that they are, in fact, that thing - along with a whole bunch of other things.  We all do it, because it's simply so much easier to find the tag and hang it on the victim than to look at the complexity of who they are. Shit, you might get embroiled in all sorts of messy shit! And some of it might stick!  And the net makes it easier. We start acting like bad search algorithms; classifying people in the most simplistic, easily recallable manner. We code them, label them and file 'em away.  I surf around the net and I see an awful lot of judgment. And little by little it is taking a toll on my patience. What's more, for all these staunchly held opinions, very few people are energetic enough and research what their talking about before they mouth off.  We were chatting, Conrad and I, and he said, 'You aren't a submissive.' I think I followed with 'Am too!', or something equally infantile. Then he said, 'No, it doesn't define you, it's not the whole of you. You aren't trapped in it.' (you'll all forgive me, I'm paraphrasing here)  In any case, it occurred to me that, if we are guilty of judging others, we are even guiltier of judging ourselves.  rg             urlLink Read more!

Most of the sets in this show are larger than most of the apartments I've lived in.  Vocal warm ups, get miked, get in costume and then sit.  I am not complaining, really.  Monday night I sat from 7 PM till 1 AM and never got on stage.  Last night I finally got on around midnight.    I am the helpful sort...I find it difficult to sit still.

Women whom i don't really love became my girlfriends. Thats also why, the relationship did not stay too long because the affections  were not present in the first place.   Hap, maybe the one i love and may appreciate  me have yet to come. Or maybe, she never exist. No matter what, i believe i have come to a point where i must be able to accept a plausible reality that i may stay single for the rest of my life. Its a blessing to be able to share your happiness, woes and smiles with the person you love. Its definitely many times better than me sitting in front of the monitor now and try to share my woes with myself.   Hap, it wasn't easy to fall in love again.. and i thought you knew. But.. yah, that does not mean that the person i fall, must reciprocate my feelings. I know.. i really do. But, i promised myself to look forward, to accept reality, to never run away from it, so that i will never reach a point in life where i could no longer retreat. Reaching that point is like reaching the top of the cliff where if you retreat, you will fall to your death, no i should say worse than death because death is a form of escaping away.   Hap, your name is the short form for Happiness. 'Hap'.. thats why you are the best person i can relate and the best name i could find. I want hope and i know hope never fails to come by in my life. I don't know if i would love another again. I only know it would be even more difficult to do that again. I know she really love her boy a lot. I know what happened to her relationship, but because things will never be possible for us, i also know that, regardless of any efforts, amount of time or feelings i inject, it will not change the fact that, she loves him.

Plus I have been drinking quite a bit. Including last night, when I went to Shinjuku, in Tokyo, to meet some friends for a birthday drink. Shinjuku is about an hour away. For the people back home, it's like going to Edinburgh for a night's drinking and arriving back at about 2am. Man, do become jet lagged, exhausted, hungry then allow your friends to buy you inordinately strong long island iced teas - especially when they are bigger than a pint. Right now, I just want to sleep for a week...preferably with a nice 'pillow' :P  My internet access here is very limited. FTP is also blocked in the office, and so is outlook, including web access. This makes it difficult to get uni email. In fact I don't even have a mobile yet. I can get a contract one in about a week or so when my registration card arrives at city hall.  I've calmed down a bit since I got here and started to settle in. I wanted to post really badly, but there are no internet cafes around and I have been pretty busy in work getting up to speed. So here is what I can currently remember about the past week:   Day 1 (7/7/04 - Monday)  An interesting trip over. Arrived early at Glasgow airport with my dad. We had coffee and cake for a while, then (wee fax just arrived for me) I boarded the 13.30 flight to London. The flight was fine and we arrived a few minute early. Then the trouble started. I had to go to my connecting flight, so looked at the connections board, misread the terminal, and went to the wrong one! Anyone who has gone between terminals there know that the bus take about 5-10 minutes. I had just under an hour to make the connection and had to go through security again (cause I went out of the terminal). So I ran the last couple of hundred meters and made it, just. Then went up the wrong ramp, but finally made in onto the plane. Now, having just ran, and not being able to do so very well, I had to sit sweating on the plane. Now, this would have been fine in the air conditioning was working properly. But we were delayed and the engines were not started. So we had to cook in the plane for about 20 minutes before we left. I was unimpressed at the recent events.   During the flight I mostly watched TV and read through my arrival instructions. My TV was a bit screwed and would occasionally serenade me with loud static. Nice. Didn't get much sleep, but I did manage an hour or two. The flight took about 11 hours I think, and the flight to London was about one and a half. I arrived in Narita airport (outside Tokyo) at roughly 11.30am local time.  There was more trouble to come (damn I'm hungry right now, I wish I had brought my birthday cookies in). I had brought about (fuck, no pound sign on this keyboard!) £285 in cash with me. I had intended to exchange it in Glasgow, but there was no Yen available. And, giving my antics in Heathrow, there was no time. However, worried I was not! 'I'll exchange it at Narita' I thought. Thought wrong did I! The problem is that they do not accept Scottish bank notes. I could have expected this, but I completely forgot I had Scottish notes.   Needing to call NTT and being strapped for cash, I remembered I had a phone card from my last visit. This was a real break :) I called the secretary at planning section in NTT to let her know my situation. I managed to get about £20 from my visa card at an ATM in Narita. The bus ticket to Atsugi is about £15. I had to go there and meet a member of staff, who then took me to my dormitory (mmm just had dinner, a so far very pleasant experience in work - explain later, not what you think :P). We had a chat in the car about various things, nothing comes to mind at the moment. Several key landmarks were pointed out to me, like the Sagamihara river. The drive was around 25 minutes.  After arriving at my dormitory and being shown to my room, we discovered that it was covered in damp! So I was given a separate room temporarily. The room is Japanese style, with a entrance area where you take your shoes off and a lot of storage. The room has only air conditioning, air cleaner, desk and a chair. It's comfortable large, but in real terms the minimalism makes it look so. I hired a futon set until Sunday. The futon set is a foldable mattress, pillow and sheets. After moving the futon in, I was give £150 by the member of staff to survive on until I could arrange money. It was only today that I found out the money was from his own pocket! I had believed it was an advance from the company. I was incredibly grateful. However, people seem to offer loans on short term too easily. Personally I hate borrowing money from someone unless I can give it back to them at an ATM later in the day or so.  I was shown around the rest of the dorm. There are two buildings, a dining hall and communal Japanese bath. This style of bath is where you shower first at a tap and shower-head, then soak in the bath for a while. There's something about bathing with a bunch of naked strangers.  Afterwards, I unpacked my stuff and got cleaned up. Later I had dinner and went to sleep at 9 or 10. I had no energy to go exploring, and the staff member would drive me to work in the morning as his apartment is nearby.   Day 2 (8/7/04 - Tuesday)  I got up at roughly 5am - I couldn't sleep as usual. After getting washed I donned a shirt and tie, grabbed my bag and waited what felt like an eternity until the staff member arrived - he was prompt.   -  -  -  Right, I have to go catch my bus to the train station now. I will fill out more tomorrow if I can. Some things I should explain: 1- My camera was not charged when I got here and I only got a cable, from the endless supply of equipment in the labs, on Friday. Therefore I have only a few photos.  2- FTP access is blocked, so I will need o find other means to upload this picture.  3- I'm nackered and in a hurry. If the above doesn't make sense...ah well.

Then I passed out on the couch for about two hours. I am still tired. I didn't get any sleep last night. Sucks. So most of my day was spent 'bonding' with my family. It wasn't too bad... i guess. I think I may like someone, but i am not too sure. I can't tell you who it is tho.. hah. So don't beg for me to tell you, cause it's not gunna happen!! I may go and see Shrek 2 again tomorrow.. hopefully. That is the best movie ever. But Shrek and Pheona should've stayed pretty, in my opinion. Cause I wouldn't like life too much if I was scaring ppl away. Well I hope that never happens to me, but you never know. I can't wait until I start cheering again. I miss it a lot... I'm a lil scared right now, I'm watching Ghost Ship, like alone. Here I go again, damn I'm lame. I need to make up a word... hmm.. *10 minutes later*.. No luck! Darn.. help me out here, plz.

3486137,Military,"        All right. All right. That was an inappropriate title but I need to express the anger. He is such a freaking jerk. If u don't know who 'he' is, then let me tell u. L.S. Ok so this is what happened.&nbsp;Around 5 something pm, L.S. calls me on the phone to see what I'm doing. We talked for a while & then all of a sudden he has to go because his mommy came into the car &amp; he's too scared to talk to me then. This is what I figured since he suddenly had to go. But he told me that he's going to 'call u later'. Riiight. Like that's going to happen. I knew he wouldn't call me but I didn't give a shit. So around 7:55 pm Lena calls me & tells me that she feels better &amp; that if I want, we can go outside. I say ok & we go.&nbsp;She tells me how she saw L.S. with these chicks Renata, Marlena & some other one. She said that he looked extremely happy. Anyway, Lena &amp; me walked around for a little & then we went to sit in Polak world. Whoa. I just saw the weirdest thing&nbsp;on the TV. There was a weird, say, 'cartoon'&nbsp;on the news about Kerry & Bush. They were competing about whose land it is by singing (with different lyrics) the song 'This land was made for u &amp; me' (that's not what the song is called but I forgot what it's called, I think some Johnny guy wrote it). O & at the end, Bush &amp; Kerry joined hands, it was a funny sight to behold but it was also strange. Anyway, on with the Polak world crisis crap. Well Lena & me went to sit there, when out of nowhere comes L.S., he was hanging out with Kasha (whom I waved to 3 times but she didn't 'SEE' me) &amp; her cousin & cousin's friends before we came. All righty then. He came to talk to us &amp; we talked for a while & then I said 'it's not illegal to sit' &amp; he's like 'aw u took my spot' so he sat a bit farther away. I take it as, he did it on purpose. Then the third sentence that came out of his mouth was 'So where's your friend?'. & out of us 3 (Maja, Lena, &amp; me), Maja's is the only name he can remember. Then came&nbsp;Ivana &&nbsp;Patricia (a fat & skinny duet, Polaks of course). He started talking to them, they surrounded him. He didn't talk to us at all anymore. Then eventually Kasha came when she saw that Lena &amp; me were being ignored & were talking to each other. I hate him. He is such a jerk. But yet Lena thinks I'm jealous. I used to be jealous because let me ask u, how would u feel if ANY girl that passes by talks to him &amp; sits next to him & flirts with him &amp; u like him? But once again, I don't care, I like someone else (who, by the way, ignored my 'hi' today, it wasn't that he didn't see me, because he looked me right square in the eye, but he can't say hi once again, he did it last week). So then Kasha told us quietly that she doesn't like those girls either, she once greeted them but all they did was give her the cold shoulder & look away. Then my dad called me &amp; I had to go. Lena (she's really nice, maybe I should have done the same last time but I was too scared) asked Kate if she wanted her to stay & Kate said yea because she didn't really have anyone to talk to. L.S. didn't say bye, not that I expected it, I'm just telling u. Then I went home &amp; thought of what a dumbass I am. Next time Lena & me are hanging out somewhere, &amp; he comes, without K.Z. that is, I'll just walk away. I have enough people bullshitting me, I don't need another. Hey look, it's Maja being online. I hate her too. For God's sake, why doesn't she just tell him that she likes him too & that they get together, damn it. O yea, Brandon apparently likes Maja, man I don't get it, he's a nice guy &amp; she's just weird. Whatever, I'm not the one to be telling people who to have a crush on. It's all good. Maybe I should change my quote since SOMEONE already stole it. O yea & u know how I talk to people on the internet, I have been seeing a lot of them using my little, thought-of phrases. I don't mind if it's one of my friends, but if it's someone whom I dislike, then that's going to be a problem. U know what else? L.T. IMs me &amp; says 'Elo laska'. I looked the word 'laska' up in the free Polish online dicKtionary & it said that the word means 'stick'. Um... 'Elo' might mean hello but 'laska'? Did he call me a stick? Lmao. Whoo. That's funny but then again, weird. Why do most guys treat me like shit? Is it a tradition? Milan came back from Serbia &amp; Lena saw him & he was constantly talking Serbian but he NEVER used to talk Serbian before, just English (except, of course, with his parents). &amp; Lena said that he sounds weird & that he's acting weird. That's... weird. Man I don't know what to say today. I like a guy that's maybe taken already by the biggest hoe in the hood, no offense. Omg, now I realize where she gets all the money to buy those expensive clothes! Stupid me. Just like in 50 Cent's song 'In the hood they say... 'there's no place like hoe biz' '. That's only a part of it, there's also showbiz, I would prefer that &amp; possibly it pays better. That's a big maybe again, because hell I've never been there. Heh. Or have I? Hmm... I guess it's a mystery. I'm like trying to cheer myself up, but it's not really working. I'll tell u what will cheer me up, never to see this Polak hood again. They're all jerks &&nbsp;the manager of Polak world&nbsp;(with his Harley) is trying to be all 'popular' with Fierce.

3475917,indUnk,"         Hurricane James is *proudly* introducing a new feature called 'Dykes I Like' where exceptional L Words will be periodically spotlighted.   Out of the 62 women in the House, only one is openly gay. The big dyke is Tammy Baldwin, a three-term Democrat from Wisconsin and by all accounts, she looks great these days. According to those policy wonks at the Advocate, Baldwin's 'once fussy hairdo is now softly tousled. Her boxy suits have given way to fashionable separates. In her fitted jacket, tailored slacks, and sleek high heels, she is polished but not slick. With an easy smile and a soft, feminine voice, she betrays not a hint of radicalism in appearance or delivery.'  But this Tammy is more than just a pretty face. Her showdown earlier this year with  urlLink Rick Santorum  on 'Face the Nation' proved Tammy could really kick ass, but that's not to suggest Baldwin's legislative focus is limited to gay issues and courting the polygamist/bestiality vote. The centerpiece of Baldwin’s progressive agenda, buoyed by a coalition of student, labor and minority interests, has always been the establishment of a single-payer, universal health care system.   Congratulations Tammy Baldwin, you're officially a Dyke I Like.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3465835,indUnk,"       This story must be told:  Study Abroad Trip: Salamanca, Spain I will never forget Michael. Was it just the magic of the city? Could it have been the lyrics of my Norah Jones CD? Or maybe it was the blue in his eyes. Was I really in love with two men, or did I just terribly miss my boyfriend waiting for me at home? I don't think that I will ever know what it was exactly.  It was the first Thursday in Salamanca, almost the end of the first school week. My eyes were still a little puffy from crying myself to sleep the night before, I missed my boyfriend like no other. The visually gratifying walk to school and the laughs that I shared with my new found found friends made me forget all about my sadness, and focus on how unbelievably lucky I was to get to opportunity to be here. With all that, my puffy eyes were no more. A few drinks, a few friends, no curfew, and no school the next day, it was off to our favorite club in Salamanca, the Irish Rover. There I was laughing and dancing to the music. Until then I had managed to look at every guy that passed my way as if they were just a faceless figure, it was like I was blind to every man except my boyfriend,( who was ten-thousand miles away). My 'sight' was recovered when Michael came my way.  Why was I dancing with him? Plenty of men attempted and failed horribly. Why was I smiling? I think it was the way that he did it. He danced my way ever so nonchalantly, as if he really wasn't trying to dance with me at all. This unique attempt made me laugh, it worked, I had to give him credit. He was a very handsome man. He had a beautiful face. Those piercing blue eyes, I felt so helpless when he looked right at me, as if for a few moments my entire body had gone numb and the only thing that I could feel would me my breath being taken away from me. Those lips, he had those lips that if you looked at them long enough, you would unconsciously lick your own in the hopes that they just might kiss yours. His skin, never had I been so curious to know what another mans skin felt like. All of these feelings were so deep down inside of me that I did not allow them to be visible, not even to myself, but the more that I saw him and the more that I thought about him in the following weeks, the more all these felling surfaced. So there we were, dancing, smiling, looking at each other then looking away. We exchanged names, he informed me that he wanted my number, I informed him that I had a boyfriend. It didn't seem to bother him, we just wanted to dance. His body moved every which way that I wanted it to, he was a fantastic dancer. After the boyfriend issue was made verbal, and set in stone, we went down the we're-just-friends-road. This was great, my first friend outside the group that I traveled here with. Being just friends and all, we parted ways for the last hour or so. It was really late, or should I say early, it was time to say goodbye to my new friend Michael. We said our quick goodbyes that night. At that moment it wouldn't have bothered me if I'd ever see him again  The very next day I was in an unusually good mood, I had spent the entire day by myself enjoying the fascination I had for the city. The cathedrals, the quiet parks, the dozens of fountains that I threw a coin in, the comfortable chaos of the Plaza Mayor, the cool winter air, -- and Michael! Michael? After the hundreds of faceless figures that day, my sight once again came back to me when I saw him there alone, in the most crowded street in Salamanca, sitting on a bench. He noticed me immediately after I did. I kept walking because for a moment I did not believe it was him. Someone you meet in a dance club looks a little different when you see them again in their true form. I smiled, took a couple of steps back, and sat down next to him, all the while staring at him in a what-are-you-doing-here way. It felt so good to talk to him, like he was an old friend that I hadn't seen for years. We spoke of our lives, our family, why we were here in Spain. I t was one of the best conversations I had ever had with someone that I ran into on the street. We both really didn't have anywhere to be at that moment but with each other. He impressed me by mentioning that the only reason he was on that very bench was just to watch the world pass by. His comment made me smile and I felt really lucky to be joining him in him in his favorite place. One hour and one new friend later, it was once again, time to go. We walked together until we stopped at a crossroads where we had to part ways, but this time I had no doubt in my mind that I was going to see him again. He asked for my number one more time, but this time I was not hesitant to give it to him, to my new friend.  One day, and a couple of text-messages later and there we were, underneath the clock of the Plaza Mayor, for what later became known as our first date.

We all enjoyed it.  There was this ReaLLy fat guy sitting beside vic, n he kept making fun of him, saying 'there's an ogre sitting beside me, anyone got any happily ever after potion for him?' Poor fellow..  After the movie, we all went to Ramen for dinner. The food there was great, n the time we had there was even better. We were laughing and gossiping. It was one of those moments, where everybody's at ease, n u don't want the night to end. That made the day awesome..   Today though, was entirely different.

3456930,Student,"       Well, this is going to be a different Blog. This is going to be the first of a series of CD reviews. I’m not going to just review new albums/songs either (hell, I’m a poor uni student for fuck’s sake!!), I’m also going to go back and pick some ‘classic’ ones and give you all my two-cents worth.  So in that vein, I give to you, my hapless victims, my first review:  Album: “Load” Artist: Metallica Released: 1996 Genre: Hard Rock Producer/s: Bob ‘pansy pants’ Rock with James Hetfield & Lars Ulrich Tracks: 14 Track Listing: 1.Ain’t My Bitch 2.2X4 3.The House Jack Built 4.Until It Sleeps 5.King Nothing 6.Hero Of The Day 7.Bleeding Me 8.Cure 9.Poor Twisted Me 10.Wasting My Hate 11.Mama Said 12.Thorn Within 13.Ronnie 14.The Outlaw Torn   Almost this entire album was a departure of everything everyone assumed Metallica was about. To start with, they changed the style of the way ‘Metallica’ had always been written with the distinctive knife-like points. It was like, from the outset, this album (and the follow-up, ‘ReLoad’) would be their “mid-life crisis” album. They’d released the phenomenally selling ‘Black’ album so where to from there? Release a ‘Black’ clone? Try not to live up to the massive expectations? Or try something new? I think it was mainly a combination of the second and third responses…  The artwork, by Andres Serrano (he of ‘Piss Christ’ fame several years ago), is both a pun on the title but also a piece of art that Kirk Hammett loved and talked the rest of the guys into using (they didn’t all agree on Kirk’s taste). Personally, I like it. Yes, it’s blood and semen squeezed between two sheets of glass. Maybe it’s the art student coming out in me (no pun intended) but I think it’s an awesome change of style for a ‘tallica album cover. All the rest had made not-at-all subtle statements from “Kill ‘em All”’s blood covered hammer through to The Lady Justice on “…And Justice for All”. The “Black” album was a touch more subtle but still rather literal with the ‘Don’t Tread On Me’ snake in the bottom corner. The cover art for “Load” had no direct message, and a hell of a lot of people didn’t even realise what the art was made from until they did some research. Some people hated it, others thought it was all right, and others loved it. The reaction to the artwork itself summed up the reaction to the actual music contained inside…  Anyone who was expecting a carbon copy of the “Black” album was going to be disappointed. Anyone who was expecting ‘tallica to go back to their “true” metal ways were going to be very sorely disappointed. This DID take a lot from the “Black” album (song structure, sound, etc etc etc…) but the rest of it was something a little darker but also a little more… grungy? Alternative? Experimental? Deep? Not as heavy? More mature? Maybe all of those and maybe none. Here was Metallica delving into something other than straight out, ‘in your face’, lyrics and music. They experimented with different tones, layering, vocals, and other bits and pieces to see what they could come up with. And they came up with a lot.  The lyrics took on a more personal twist as Hetfield, rather than just singing about physical and literal subject matter, delved into the psyche more. ‘The House Jack Built’, ‘Until it Sleeps’, ‘Thorn Within’ all deal with a psychological issue of some description.   ‘THJB’ is a look into the collapsing world within (perhaps a pre-marker to Hetfield’s stint in rehab in ‘02/’03?) and is asking us to “step inside”, have a look around and see the corruption that resides. ‘UIS’ is about loss and the aggression and angst that accompany this sense of loss (particularly after a loved one walks away). “So tear me open, but beware, there’s things inside without a care…” is a line I think everyone has wanted to say to a dodgy ‘other half’ who’s just fucked them over. And ‘TW’ is about the guilt and how, no matter how much people look at you with disdain, it will always be the shame the individual feels inside themselves that will be the worst part of it all. People can scorn all they like but it’s what the person feels inside that feels the worst. The conscience is a hard master.  The slower songs also took on a deeper meaning as well. These were an extension, I feel, from ‘Nothing Else Matters’ on the “Black” album. It was their first “real” ballad song and they took what they learnt in that experience and extended it into this album. ‘Hero of the Day’ and ‘Mama Said’ said a lot about the band in the sense that they didn’t HAVE to be a heavy unit all the time. They could take a softer approach and get across a different set of meanings. They didn’t have to be in your face all the time and they learnt more about the idea of building the song to a powerful conclusion. ‘HOTD’ starts out almost country like with its twanging, almost clean, tone, Hetfield’s ungrowled vocals, and then builds to a powerful finish.  Then you have the songs like ‘Bleeding Me’, ‘Cure’, ‘Poor Twisted Me’, and the slightly absurd sounding ‘Ronnie’. These are the “unsung” goodies of the album. ‘BM’ has layers of sound that takes you deeper and deeper as you listen. Layer upon layers: simple guitar riffs, bass, drums, synthesiser, vocals - then the chorus kicks in and kicks you in the guts. It takes you from one extreme to the other and drags you along on its merry little ride. ‘Cure’ has a simple rock beat but don’t mistake this for a simple song. Have a listen and see what I mean. Structure-wise this would be one of the more simple songs on the album but that doesn’t stop it from being a fairly good song.  ‘Wasting My Hate’ was the song that was probably the closest to “old-school” Metallica. Fast, aggressive, take-no-shit attitude. But even this was tempered with the new mentality that had infused the entire album. Different tones, sounds, structures, vocals – it all made it sound old yet decidedly new and it was this “newness” that people didn’t, or couldn’t, understand. Rather than just two guitars, bass, drums, and vocals, like the old days, there was multiple layering of guitar tracks, the vocals were played with sound-wise, the lyrics aren’t about hating this or that (as the name may suggest) but about NOT hating something because it just isn’t worth it in the end. It was almost a song about positive, soulful, affirmation. Hold it guys, getting into *shudder* Savage Garden territory there! But it was still “balls hanging out” rock and whatever anyone else thought be damned!  The most excellent song on the album though would have to be ‘The Outlaw Torn’. This is Metallica going back to their old epic ways, touching it up a bit with their new ways, and letting loose on a 9 minute track about pain, love, regrets, shame, pride and revenge. From the slow build up at the beginning to the instrumental-like ending this song just won’t end until you’re left drained from going with the guys on their musical odyssey.  ‘The Outlaw Torn’ pretty much sums up the entire album. It’s an album about love in all it’s guise be they painful, hateful, sorrowful, and any other something-ful you can think of to throw in there.  Overall, the album was better than their other albums in some ways (more mature-minded, deeper psychological subject matter) but left something to be desired in others. As I said, it was Metallica in mid-life crisis mode and this is the end result. An album that, left to its own merits, succeeds very well, but when compared to the expectations left by the “Black” album falls just short of the mark. It would take another 12 years after the release of the “Black” album for them to bring out another album that would once again redefine the hard rock/metal genre and prove to the world that they weren’t a bunch of middle-age Rolling Stone wannabes. They were (and are) a musical force to be reckoned with.  So, in finishing, I hope I haven’t bored you to death with this. If you have any comments, please feel free to leave them on the comments section, and if you own “Load” get it off the shelf, whack it into the CD player and give it a burl. And if you don’t own it, go out and get it.  Rating: 7.5/10     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3454871,Student,"           This morning before school I had to go in to Mr. Flanagan's room so I could finish my social studies homework. Then first hour I had a test. I feel like I did a really good job. I might have got two wrong. I really don't know. After our test we got to do what we wanted as long as it was quiet. I finished my social studies and then read my book. In second hour cooking we made cookies except Mrs. L had major PMS. She kept insulting our kitchen which was doing pretty good compared to the preps' kitchen. They had a marker in their oven. I don't even know if I'm going to go to that class tomorrow or if I'm just going to sit in Mrs. V's office the whole time. Third hour was fun. We got to make 3-D triangle things. I colored mine and gave it to Mrs. Engels. It was a joy. Mrs. Benzschawel taught us fourth hour. She is a really good teacher. At lunch the phenomenon happened. TRENT ASKED ME BACK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! I totally said yes! I was so excited. All I could say the rest of the day was OMG OMG OMG OMG! During chorus we went through our concert and decided that we would have a pizza party on Friday since our last concert will be Thursday. During study hall I scanned pictures for Mrs. Engels again. It is so much fun. Then during English we started watching the third Anne Frank movie. It really is a good movie. I love it. It's just so sad. Eighth hour social studies we corrected our assignments and then got another one. I got it done in class. After our track party, which was pretty boring, my grandpa picked me up on the cycle. It was a short ride.. but a fun one. When I got home we went to the library to get our holds and then to Wal-Mart so we could break a twenty so I could have the $7.50 I need for school. I got a magazine and Mitch got some food. Now I am typing this. I think I'm going to leave though so I can go watch this awesome movie called D-3. The third mighty ducks movie. I like these movies even though they are hockey movies. Now I'm leaving you with this to think about - If a girl got a sex change would she still get her period?         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3440611,indUnk,"       It's been a few days since I've posted anything. I've been painting the outside of the house, and the heat and humidity have drained any and all creative juices from my poor lifeless body.   Working out in the heat, I get really super thirsty. In our fridge there are like 4 beers left over from a dinner party Deanna and I had. I don't recall who brought the beers, but they left them with us, and neither of us are beer drinkers. The last time I even tasted a beer was back in the '70s. I was just a kid, and my dad let me taste his while we were visiting some relatives. It was disgusting. Yech.   And so I never had a beer after that. Just the smell of it would bring that taste back in my mouth, and kind of quenched any desire I had to taste it again.   But I was working out in the sun, and when you work out in the sun, you're supposed to have a beer when you're done, right? That's what manly men do. And I've grown a bit since I was 6 and my tastes have been refined and matured, so who knows. Maybe NOW I like beer. Maybe beer is like asparagus. You hate it when you're a kid, but then when you get older you realize it's actually really good.   So I popped open a Blatt Blue or whatever it's called and had it.   It took me like an hour and a half to drink it. It was disgusting, but I didn't want to be wasteful. So I sipped. And squinted. And sipped. And squinted.   90 minutes I put myself through that. Phew.   Beer is still gross.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3440019,Technology,"                Nowadays getting a car let alone a two wheeler has become very easy. There are banks thonging to give you loans and sometimes we can even bargain on the rate of interest. Everyday there will be calls from some bank or the other making an offer for a car loan.    But their is one question. How do we categorise driving/riding? Is it a pleasure or a pain? Most of us would agree it is more of pain than pleasure. The reason cannot be attributed to the bad roads alone, which many say are nothing but connected potholes, but to the attitude of the drivers.     I do not deny the fact that the condition of roads are very bad and causes a lot of traffic jams. But there are good roads too where traffic jams and slow moving traffic take place. The reason is us drivers. How many of us actually follow all the rules laid down by the traffic police? How many of us honk unnecessaily while waiting for the red light to change or in a slow moving traffic knowing very well that they cannot go any faster?    This is not done by only the uneducated people but by the so called 'educated' people, the graduates, post-graduates. There are instances where the signal is red, the traffic police is not present and we break the rule. We drive rash and create problems for the other drivers. The reason is we get the 'Kick' out of this. On top of this is the drunk driving. People are least bothered if the drunk drivers die in an accident as they deserve it but what about the people who are the victimes of these drunken monks.    The latest is teenagers driving without licence. What are the parents of these children think they are doing? They are playing with both the lives of their children and the others. Have they no conscience or moral that they are breaking the law they have accepted to abide by.    People sometimes drive as if they are in a race even in residential areas where they very well know that they have to curtail their speeds to the maximum.   When rains come God save the pedestrains from the splashes we drivers create while wading through the rain waters. Can't we be considerate. Are we such barbarians?    This is utterly insane. Don't we have the slightest responsibility to uphold the law. On top of this we always say that the police harrass the people. I don't say this never happens but if we abide by the law the police will most probably not harrass us. If we are caught the first thing we do is negotiate a bribe with the police. When we do that we don't think that the polce has lost all respect for us. When I was caught for a wrong turn I paid the fine in whole and apologised and the inspector was also very kind and apologised for the trouble they supposedly to have caused. I think everyone has the duty to uphold the law and should not blame the police alone. Only then can we make driving a pleasure.    Thanks once more for your patience and please comment on will.

I liked the 80s and 90s music juxtaposed with the early 1900s scenery. It was like a pop up book come alive. I enjoyed it. Nicole Kidman's baby voice was a little irritating. John Leguizamo's lisp was hysterical. The whole show was put together well. I especially liked the ending-not happily ever after. Its refreshing to ditch the white horse and the sunset.

It was a post about the prom...*ahem*...since yesterday was mostly dominated by that event. (It was the night of the Poway High prom, and Neen went.)  Anyway, I just realized that loads of the kids at the prom last night must be going to church this morning...aaah! Wow though, I mean really - they must not have been able to get any sleep AT ALL! Because Neen didn't get home til 5 am...so...yeah. And then everyone else has to get up pretty early for church, right? Heheh, poor students...although I guess that all of them who take AP classes are probably used to not getting any sleep by now, anyway. :) ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I tried to contact the ped gi, and they said he wouldn't be back until tuesday.  Finally - worried that he wouldn't live long enough to see the ped gi, I took him to the hospital - we ran around and got his lab results and what have you first so they could see what was found so far, and finally got to the hospital about 4:30.  When they finally got him into a room,they started an iv, infiltrated the vein, refused to acknowledge the mottling of the skin on his hand as the fluids built up in his hand.  He moved his hand so it was the highest part on his arm, and when they finally removed it, he couldn't move his shoulder area.  But once again, they claimed it wasn't infiltrated, they just said he was picking up on my queues.  Personally I think that is the excuse of those that are deficient of skills in the medical field to cover their screw ups.

Isn't it great how you care so much for a person, and that person in return lies to you? You want them so badly to pass, do good in like, HAVE A LIFE FOR PETE'S SAKE!...and they just don't care, and they say how much you sound like their mom. And then, you see who they run to. They go to people who don't care...who couldn't give a fuck if they passed or failed high school, if they lived in a card board box...isn't that just kind of starnge. I thought best friends were suppose to care for the other. Were suppose to what they in all aspects of life. And they just don't care. Well fine, you know what? I just don't give a rats ass anymore. She can go off, be in high school for the next 20 years for all I care. She can go off and have to sell herself on the streets to try and support herself. Because if shes going to pull shit like this...and all because I fucking yelled at her and shes failing. Then fine. She can. But you know what Kristen?

Otherwise, you would not have agreed with him. What did I lie to you about? School? School has been over for a week now. Yes, I failed, and that's why I'm going to summer school. That, along with the fact that I can't stand not doing anything for days on end, so summer school is a good thing. And you know what? You can't blame me for not being in Plato. That was my mother's fault for not signing me up in time. I went, they sent me home. Well guess what. I'm back in it now, so you can shut up anytime now. I took care of it. And I don't know why you two are so freakin pissed off at me all the time now. Have I really turned into that bad of a person? Or are you just being that hipocritical?

Two of us had tickets to every game except the Czech game. We arrived in the afternoon on Sunday, and got right to the camping. There were still places available and the site was right in the centre of town. So we where well pleased with it. The city is absolutely beautiful. And it has a few Port brewery type places, of which we did one tour (with tasting afterwards).The first evening we went to the first pub we saw for a meal and the England game (lost 2-1 Against France). The first few days we stayed there, untill the match of Holland against Germany at Dragau stadium. We walked in the Orange march to the stadium, pretty cool. And the 2 of us who had tickets (Rob and Maurits) went into the stadium. Me and Mabel went for a walk around the stadium and met a few greek guys, and a guy from Al-Jazeera tv. The greek guys stayed to look at the game with us. And the Al-Jazeera guy gave me his email (Job-possibility in Quatar??). The game ended 1-1 and we went into town to party. Next day we left Porto for the peace and quiet of inner Portugal. We arrived in the beautiful Serra da Estrela. A mountain area with a highest point (Torre) of 1993m. We had a mountain-bike trip, a walk trip and so on in this beautiful area. Here we saw the next matches. First the English against the swiss (won 3-0). Next the dutch team played (lost 3-2 against the Czech republic). The day afterwards we where going straight on to Braga. But that's a story for week 2.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, ok, we all know that's a video for a Darkness song. Alright, I've done nothing of interest since my last post because I'm just a bizarre combination of crap and unpopular, although now I think about it the two may well go hand in hand...    So moving on from that suicide-inducing train of thought, I just had to update you all on my life so far. I've done things, seen things that mere mortals can only  dream  of... Or pay £40 to see, at any rate. My most recent outing of note was to the Goodwood Festival of Speed. And it was fantastic! I stood on a Formula 1 car (accidentally, I might add; Had I not stepped on it's nosecone then I would have gone flying into the running engine and we  all  know what sort of hell  that  can be), I got deafened, I saw the Bentley LeMans racer, I got deafened, I saw the Paris-Dakar Rally Trucks (they're  HUGE ), I got deafened... I think you can spot a theme running through this. The day was rather loud, but immense fun.  Apart from that, I'm a bit dry really. Had I written this immediately afterwards I could have furnished you with all the detail and colour (note spelling, Americans among you) which my Blog has come to represent, but I was too lazy and hence didn't do it.   Well, I'm helping to move SESO a third of the way across the country at the weekend, so no doubt there will be some mirth generated there (though I have a sneaky suspicion that I won't be laughing much at the time).

3401697,Student,"       well ive been back in SC for about two weeks now and it is hot as fuck here.  i havent updated mainly for two reasons, the first is that i am slack and the second is that when i tried the sight kept booting me off.  well anyways i am back. right when i  got back i went to cross country camp in the North Carolina mountains.  it was awesome.  good times hiking, rafting, rappeling, and building fires and of course playing frisbee.  that was a good week. atcamp we had a race of about 2 to 2.5 miles and i was the third best on the team behind BJ and Joey.  i was only about 10 seconds behind though in a time of 16:08 i think.   when i got back from that last sunday, monday morning i, chris, and peter went to the vans warped tour in charlotte.  we saw a bunch of good bands including but not limited to Rufio, Underoath, Taking Back Sunday, Flogging Molly, Story of the Year, Going nowhere, and probably some more that i cant remember.  the best was Story of the year.  then flogging molly.  overall though, it was an awesome day.  the next day practice began and we did about 2 long miles in that damned thing humidity.  i swear i could have taken a slice of the air and eaten it.  then we went swimming at bellinger.  wednesday we ran buildups.  my times were about 7:19 and 7:33ish.  then we hit the weght room.  thursday was about 4 miles in the hottest fucking day of the summer.  it was easily over 100 degrees outside.  well it is good for me to get accustommed to the heat again.  then we went swimming agian.  finally friday we played frisbee instead of running but it was hard core frisbee.  saturday i read alot and went to collateral (the ending sucked) then today just hung araound and went to chris's house.  we ate at hardee's.  i forgot to mention that Spiderman 2 and harold and kumar go to white castle are both great movies and i reccomend everyone go see them.

Essay prompt:   John Winthrop's goal was to create a 'City Upon a Hill'?  Like John Winthrop, Jefferson believed Americans had a special destiny and responsibility: 'The eyes of the virtuous all over the earth are turned with anxiety upon us as the only depositories of the sacred fire of liberty, and...our falling into anarchy would decide forever the destinies of self government.'  This was the Republican vision of the City Upon the Hill. If Americans were to be a virtuous people, would all of the people in the new nation be allowed to become American?  Throughout history how and why have Americans struggled to live up to these principals?   I need a Muchas Gracias Burritto.  Ms. Clark          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3400670,Student,"             Ok, with the approval of Ms.Clark, I would like to ask everyone your opinions on the impending possibility of a draft.   Here is a  urlLink great article that introduces a glimpse of the growing probability of a draft    I didn't know that our country has 1.44 MILLION TROOPS stationed in 141 countries. Why would we want to police the whole world?  And given the result of the past few days, the miserable situations our armed forces got into in Iraq, the situation seems somewhat scary. And I know it's inevitable, but Rumsfeld's decision to keep the soldiers there for 90-120 days more is an act that would further degrade the morale of the army, after already almost all of the frontline soldiers have been put on suicide watch.   And here is an article from CNN that accounts for the Bi-Partisan support in congress for the draft   CHARLES RANGEL   Democratic Congressman from New York and Korean War vet   Staying the course in Iraq means increasing our troop strength, and, not surprisingly, recruitment and re-enlistment levels are down. But proposed enlistment bonuses and other economic incentives will not make the military any more attractive to upper-middle-class young people. Increasingly we will be a nation in which the poor fight our wars while the affluent stay home.   To correct the disparity among those who serve, South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings and I have proposed a new draft. All men and women ages 18 to 26 would be eligible for induction once they have completed high school. Those not needed in the military would perform civilian service. Enacting our plan would democratize our armed forces and return to the 'citizen soldier' ideal that has served our nation so well.  As a veteran, I strongly believe that fighting for our country must be fairly shared by all racial and economic groups. Nobody wants to go to war, but the burden of service cannot fall only on volunteers who, no matter how patriotic, are attracted to the military for financial reasons. We cannot continue to pretend it is fair that one segment of society makes all the sacrifices.   CHARLES MOSKOS   Professor of sociology at Northwestern University and a former draftee   Our country is facing new kinds of threats and needs a new kind of draft. Even before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, our military was severely overstretched in fulfilling its missions. But more important, we have done nothing serious about homeland defense in the war against terrorism. We need guards for our nuclear power plants, dams and public facilities. We have done little to create the necessary border patrollers, customs agents and cargo-ship inspectors. Short-term draftees, under professional supervision, could perform these duties admirably. It takes less than four months to train a military police officer—precisely the kind of role most needed in peacekeeping missions and guard duties. This would free up professional soldiers, and it would stop the unprecedented activation of reservists. Their multiple tours have led to demoralization and impending recruitment shortfalls.   We must institute a three-tiered draft system in America, with 15-to-24-month tours of duty for citizens ages 18 to 26. In the new-style draft, conscripts could serve in the military, in homeland security or in a civilian-service program like AmeriCorps—and there is no reason women could not be drafted for the latter categories   JAMES INHOFE   Republican Senator from Oklahoma   I think I'm the only member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who would reinstate the draft. There are huge social benefits that come from it. I can assure you I would not be in the U.S. Senate today if I had not gone through the draft. When I look at the problems of some of our kids in America nowadays and then I go visit the troops, I see what a great benefit it is to give people the opportunity to serve their country.   I was drafted into the Army in January 1957 and served two years as an enlisted man. I gained a new outlook on life through the rigors of basic training. The military can have a more intense influence on soldiers when they are drafted and have no choice. I developed a sense of patriotism through the experience of serving my country. I'm not on a crusade, but I think today's youth could use more of that type of discipline.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3400670,Student,"             Ok, just in case you have not realized, I've completely changed our AP US History website for the better. There is a 'contributing members' section on the sidebar that allows us to look at our APUSH friend's blogging profiles. And I've added three things:  1: tagboard(which is for visitors to post; or you can post short comments and quick questions and answers on some small particular topics - there is a limit to how many words one can post on the tagboard at once), 2: The title bar: The title bar serves to better organize our blogs by forcing everyone of us to post the topic we will be discussing in our posts. Thus people will know exactly what the post is for w/o reading sometimes long and tedious posts. 3: Comment option for every post.

3394485,indUnk,"       Last night we played a show in Denton, TX, a college town just outside the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex. It was about a four hour drive from Austin that we did starting at about  four-thirty. We got to the club right about at nine at the end of our assigned load-in window becuase of difficulties finding the club -- the Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studio and bar -- which was bizzarely located in the middle of the industrial zone on the edge of town.       When we finally got there, the show ended up being about average for tour: a dark divey-looking place that turns out to have some history on the circuit that good bands play (posters for Mates of State, Don Caballero, others), starting late and playing to only a handful of people -- this time aggravated by the fact that this was a college-town bar in the middle of a summer rainstorm. There were, as always, a couple of things that set this show apart: while waiting for the soundguy, we ordered a pizza, not expecting it to arrive until after our set as the club was pretty removed from what passes for Denton civilization, only to have it show up seeminly instantaneously and be quite good: J &amp; J's knows their stuff. The two other bands, The Glass Factory and The Tah Dahs, each had members that qualified as (very) minor indie rock celebrities: Glass Factory bass player had been in Mineral and The Tah Dahs singer/guitarist has played with the Polyphonic Spree. Both bands were pretty good, a strong 7 or 8 each on the scale of the bands we've ever played with.      After the show, we loaded our stuff into the van and headed back towards Austin. It was about 1am and it's a long drive, but we'd been getting to sleep pretty late on each of the previous nights so we figured we might as well do it and have the full day to spend with Chris. When we finally found our way onto the highway going the right direction, it started raining. Or, more accurately, it started raining again, since the condition of the road showed that it'd been raining pretty heavily on and off for a while. The rain built and built, coming down in heavy sheets reducing visibility and roaring as it banged on the van's roof. Then it would suddenly die off for patches between torrents. Each section of the storm was worse than the last, finally forcing me to slow the van to about fifty since I could only see for feet in front of me. A new and exciting danger developed then in the form of speeding towers of light and noise -- big rigs that couldn't slow down safely in the wet and couldm't see small cars (like our enormous, SUV-limo sized van) in the squall. We pulled off the highway, fording a side road ankle deep in water to get to a Mobil travel center and gas station. We took a Polaroid under the gushing overhang overflow and then headed inside, standing momentarily inside the sliding doors shaking our head in disbelief and an attempt to dry off, as would, we'd soon see, every other incoming customer. After using the bathroom (and especially the hand dryer, for cycle upon cycle) and wandering around the inensely-white-lit store staring at candy and leafing through Maxim, FHM, and Smooth (the particularly excellent latino version), we sloshed back out to the van to decide what to do.      After a discussion with a kindly highway patrol officer with a deep and wide scar on his left cheek about road conditions and a vote of two-to-one, we decided to drive over and park in the McDonalds parking lot to sleep until sunrise. We called Chris to leave a voice mail telling him not to worry about our absence. Just after getting off the phone, as we were settling into our cramped quarters in the van and preparing to grouse about the flood lights in the parking lot, there was a particularly forceful blast of lightning and all of the ourdoor lights went out within our field of sight. We slept fitfully for about three hours in the half-gloom.      After a relatively uneventful, if wet, morning drive (featuring a particularly pleasant listen to Mingus' Ah Um) we arrived back, alive, at Chris's apartment and fell on the floor asleep. Now, food and some solid loungin' hours later, we're getting ready to go see I Robot. We probably won't tell you how it is.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3392873,Fashion,"       Once upon a time, a young man went to the circus. He was very excited, as he lived in western Manitoba and had never seen a circus before; the kind of town where you shave and the trolley stops. Anyway, as circus days drew nigh, the young man grew ever more excited. He arrived before dawn to get the best seat in the house and sat down hours before the first trapeze act.   Finally, the trapeze artists gave an awe-inspiring performance, the elephants danced and the lion tamer tamed. At last, the clowns came out in full regalia and green hair. They rode around by the gross in a purple Volkswagen. The Volksie pulled up to center of the ring and an overweight clown with orange hair, acne and a purple nose advanced to the podium: 'Will the person in section A, row Y, seat 42 please stand up?'   The young man looked at his ticket, and to his surprise, he was sitting in that very seat. The young man stood up. The clown then says, 'Well-l-l-l-l-l, there's the horse's ass, now where's the rest of the horse?'   The entire crowd burst out into laughter. The young man, dumbfounded, stood for a moment, then made his way quickly through crowd and out of the tent. Returning home, he wept for days, and mourned the loss of dignity and honor.   Eventually reason overcame his grief and the young man grew determined. 'I'm not going to get mad, I'm going to get even and avenge the honor of myself, my family, and this town,' he exclaimed. He picked up the curriculum guide for the University of Nevada at Las Vegas (UNLV) correspondence courses and started to read. Eventually  his eyes came to rest on an ad for a class in 'Quick Wit Retort.'   'Learn how to use those snappy comebacks to your advantage, now!'   So the young man sent in his $19.95 and soon received the course materials. In a few weeks, the young man mastered the materials and sent the final back to UNLV. Much to his surprise, a registered letter arrived from the president of UNLV. It read: 'Dear Sir: We are utterly flabbergasted at your performance in Quick Wit Retort 101. We would be most gratified if you could come to UNLV to complete your degree with our fine academic institution. Here's a check to cover your expenses.'   To make a long story short, the young man made straight A's in the QWR program. He was awarded numerous distinctions and when he graduated, the graduation speaker, General Colin Powell (U.S. Army, Ret.), awarded the man the Presidential Medal of Outstanding Quick Wit Retort, signed by George W Bush himself! Some days afterward, Harvard University sent a Lear jet to pick the man up for an interview.   The graduate admissions officer didn't mince words. 'If you complete our masters/doctoral tenured track program in QWR, you will never have to worry about money again,' said he. Needless to say, the young man promptly moved to Cambridge. In five years, the man had finished his doctorate. By this time, the young man was known throughout the world as the leading expert in Quick Wit Retort. Word had even reached western Manitoba, which, of course, made his mother very proud. Everyone from Pentagon pundits to Beltway bandits consulted the man on technical questions of QWR.   One day, while sitting at his desk reading his hometown newspaper, the young man noticed that the circus was coming to his hometown again. An evil smile crossed the young man's face. 'Hobbs,' cried the man to his assistant, 'We must be away to Manitoba. Ready the jet!' As the plane crossed the purple mountains majesty and the fruited plains, the young man savored the moment of victory that was to be his. He arrived at the circus tent very early, making sure to get that very special seat: Section A, Row Y, seat 42.   Finally, the circus began. The trapeze artists gave an awe- inspiring performance, the elephants danced, and the lion tamer tamed. At last, the clowns came out in full regalia and green hair. They rode around by the gross in a purple Volkswagen. The Volksie pulled up to center of the ring and an overweight clown with orange hair, acne, and a purple nose advanced to the podium: 'Will the person in section A, row Y, seat 42 please stand up?'   The young man glanced at his ticket. This time he was ready. The clown looks up at him and says, 'Well-l-l-l-l, there's the horse's ass, now where's the rest of the horse?'   The young man rose to his feet, full of confidence. He knew from his years of training that there was only one thing he could do. He thrust out his chest and said in the loudest voice you can imagine: 'FUCK YOU, CLOWN!!!!'         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have your sword or other warrior weapon out and keep bolts in your quiver. Join the pheonix gang in Varrock. Go to the weapons store and kill the weapons master(You must be lvl 20 or have mith/ammy/silverlight).  Then take the crossbows. You may wait for them to respawn and take more. Keep one and put the rest in the bank. Train your ranged to more than your attack skill if not already done.   With your sword out and leather armor, attack a mage in the wilderness or accept a challenge. Change your weapon to the crossbow(that's why your wearing leather). The mage will have an auto weakness to ranging. He will soon die.   Take the mage's items. Now, you are probably rich and strong. You will be immune to both warrior's and archer's weakness points.

I don't want to stop writing just because I'm not interested in the tarot, so I won't let it stop me. If I do my tarot stuff fine, if I don't fine. The whole point of this journal was supposed to be about my spiritual journeys anyway.   So onto the journey right? Well as it stands now, I consider myself pagan. Right now I'm kind of mix and matching two separate paths, Asatru, or norse paganism with american indian shamanism. It's been interesting, and I haven't learned nearly enough to feel comfortable in either.   That's not right, I feel comfortable in them, I just to feel proficient in them. I never much liked being a newbie at anything, and so here I am a very definite newbie. I find it kind of hard to study, Dan is very reluctant about me being pagan. As long as I'm not saying anything about it, it's all good. Sort of. He very much wants me to attend the LDS church with him. I don't mind going to support him, but that's not what he's looking for.   I don't want to be Christian. If find the religion stifling, yet I find myself reading more of and about the bible than I ever did while I was Christian. The more I read, the more convinced I am that it is not the religion for me. Dan doesn't seem to understand this. He sees me reading the bible and takes hope that I'll change my mind and come back to Christ. I can't do it though, having left, the thought of going back feels so wrong!   We've always followed the soft voice, the feeling in our gut, the compass in our head. It's always been an important part of our relationship, and yet he can't understand that the soft voice is SCREAMING at me about how  wrong  Christianity is, my gut twists itself into knots at the thought of returning, the compass in my head points strongly in another direction.   I have never been lead astray by these as a Christian, and I seriously doubt that somehow they'd suddenly betray me and lead me false now. Especially since my studies feel so much like coming  home .   Ken gave me a barnes and noble gift certificate for $25. I haven't spent it yet, but I so badly want to spend it on books to further my search. Problem is, Ken is a devout Catholic. Last thing I want is for him to try to convince me of the 'error' of my ways too. Then again he might not, he already thinks I'm nuts.   Well I've never been one to choose the easy road. Everything in my life has been the path less taken, so why should this choice be any different?   Sometimes I just get tired of fighting for what feels right, and think it'd be so easy to let the current wash me away.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3372401,indUnk,"           Fat people piss me off, and not just because they get to the spare ribs before I do at OCB. No it goes deeper than that. Fat people think that they suffer from an illness and the world is against them. They blame the media for idealizing skinny women. They say that obesity is an illness, that they can’t control themselves. Like there’s a little voice inside their head that tells them they have to eat more. What a lame excuse for being a disgusting pig. There’s a little voice inside my head that tells me to strangle women while I’m having sex with them but I show restraint, and rarely choke bitches, unless they ask for it.  The problem with these fat women is that most of the time they don’t think they’re really fat. Sure they complain about being too big but that’s just so some kind sap will tell them they aren’t. So just so there is no doubting whether a woman is fat or not here’s my helpful guide, it’s simple really:  If you weigh 150 lbs or more and are shorter than 7 foot tall, you are fat.   It’s that simple. Sure there are guys that will tell you that you’re not but those guys just want to get a blow job out of it. The only reason men are nice to fat women is because they want money from them, they want want to seem nice to their non- disgusting friends, they are priming them up for when they are really desperate or they are in a frat. That’s about it.  So when you go to Hardees and order 3 thick burgers and extra large fries that Diet Coke that you ordered isn’t gonna do anything for you.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3369840,Accounting,"       OP-ED COLUMNIST  Clash of Civilizations By MAUREEN DOWD  Published: May 13, 2004 Testifying before the Senate yesterday, General Richard Myers admitted that we're checkmated in Iraq.  'There is no way to militarily lose in Iraq,' he said, describing the generals' consensus. 'There is also no way to militarily win in Iraq.'  Talk about the sound of one hand clapping. And they say John Kerry is on both sides of issues.  Sounding like Mr. Kerry, General Myers summed up: 'This process has to be internationalized. The U.N. has to play the governance role. That's how we're, in my view, eventually going to win.'  The administration's demented quest to conquer Arab hearts and minds has dissolved in a torrent of pornography denigrating other parts of the Arab anatomy. George Bush, who swept into office on a cloud of moral umbrage, now has his own sex scandal — one with far greater implications than titillating cigar jokes.  The Bush hawks, so fixated on making the Middle East look more like America, have made America look un-American. Should we really be reduced to defending ourselves by saying at least we don't behead people?  Gripped in a 'I can't look at them — I've got to look at them' state of mind, lawmakers grimly filed into private screening rooms on the Hill to check out the 1,800 grotesque images of sex, humiliation and torture.  'They're disgusting,' Senator Dianne Feinstein told me. 'If somebody wanted to plan a clash of civilizations, this is how they'd do it. These pictures play into every stereotype of America that Arabs have: America as debauched, America as hypocrites.  'Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz act like they know all the answers, almost like a divine right,' she said. 'They don't have a divine right, and they are wrong.'  After 9/11, America had the support and sympathy of the world. Now, awash in digital evidence of uncivilized behavior, America has careered into a war of civilizations. The pictures were clearly meant to use the codebook of Muslim anxieties about nudity and sexual and gender humiliation to break down the prisoners.  Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell said some photographs seemed to show Iraqi women being commanded to expose their breasts — such debasement, after a war that President Bush partly based on women's rights.  The problem, of course, is that the war in Iraq started with lies — that Saddam's W.M.D. were endangering our security and that Saddam was linked to Al Qaeda and 9/11.  In a public relations move that cheapens the heroism of soldiers, the Pentagon merged the medals for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, giving the G.W.O.T. medal, for Global War on Terrorism, in both wars to reinforce the idea that we had to invade Iraq to quell terrorism. The truth is that our invasion of Iraq spurred terrorism there and around the world.  That initial deception — and headlong rush to throw off international conventions and old alliances, and namby-pamby institutions like the U.N. and the Red Cross — led straight to the abuse of Abu Ghraib. Now the question is whether the C.I.A. tortured Al Qaeda operatives.  Officials blurred the lines to justify ideological decisions, calling every Iraqi who opposed us a 'terrorist'; conducting rough interrogations, perhaps to find the nonexistent W.M.D. so they would not look foolish; rolling all opposition into one scary terrorist ball that did not require sensitivity to the Geneva Conventions or 'humanitarian do-gooders,' to use the phrase of Senator James Inhofe, a Republican.  Senator Fritz Hollings made it clear yesterday that Rummy has left us undermanned and undertrained in Iraq — another factor in the torture scandal. 'Now, in a country of 25 million, you're trying to secure it with 135,000,' he scolded Mr. Rumsfeld, adding: 'We're trying to win the hearts and minds as we're killing them and torturing them.' At least, he said sarcastically, Gen. William Westmoreland never asked a Vietcong general to take the town, 'like we have for Falluja. We've asked the enemy general to take the town.'  The hawks, who promised us garlands in Iraq, should have recalled the words of the historian Daniel Boorstin, who warned that planning for the future without a sense of history is like planting cut flowers.

Uncle Mike and I are in the process of moving and as always, viewing your possesions heaped in moldy cardboard squares gives you perspective on what is important. What you can take with you. What you can live without. So much of emphasis in a material-driven society tottering with human loneliness at the same time. It astounds me. Astounds me more than hippie-elfs and  mystic-recluses. What people value as externally important vs. the internal drive to feel as human as possible.    Good news is my health. The last twenty-four months have been open hurricane season on my body. I've been working roughly 60-80 hours a week, two jobs, trying to make bank, but blessed none the less. For a while I was working 8am to 2am everyday...heavily flooded with caffeine. Last May I actually had two days where I was forced to work 40 hours shifts intermittently and it just about floored me, only I'm always so zany and overly-exerted anyway...good news is that working odd hours forces you to write; compells you to analyze your life and acknowledge what you want to do with it.  But sleeps nice too. I've been averaging a stellar 10 hours a night and its UNBELIEVABLE. (Codeine-god love it. The miracle Vice!) My stress rashes and acne are also starting to subside. As is my caffeine intake. I don't care what anyone says, Starbucks imbibed under certain copious dosages equates nothing short of a lethal injection to the nervous system. Even certain powdry dust is nowhere in the same Java-area code as Starbucks. Of course that's debatable. I hate coke--I mean I really hate coaciane. Next to Heroin its the one drug that I've seen sew war havoc on individuals life. A good buddy of mine got heavily into it and he had a heart attack one night at age 24. He practically lost his septum too. He would just sit around and shove white-dust up his nostrils until they would bleed and he would then wedge flecks of cotton up there to quell the bleeding and then act like the reason his lips were crimson-coated was becasue of the altitude in the room.      But caffeine as well. I got my first coffee pot when I was fourteen and me, being the studious writer that I am, used to burn-out coffee pots in high school like a flailed academic rushing out his flat thesis. Trying to prove something no one really cares about. In high-school I wrote arrogant as all get-out 'po-ems' (two syllables) and was a purported authority on everything. I probably should have come home with more wedgies. I probably sounded like many liberal art profs. today sound...overly important, solipsistic, academically-indulgent, vanity-driven. It takes a long ass time for the scholar, the poet, the artist to realize that the world of art (even the world) wasn't designed for their own personal carp and critique. Everything you do in life has to done for the benefit of humanity. It has to be done for the benefit of the other.   Example, suicides kinda run in my family. My mom trunk of the genealogical tree  (ironically Czech...her maiden name was Bozac and her grandfather was sponsored illegally in America as a Bottlegger, employed by Al Capone himself) has been riddled with them--mostly attempts. Four years ago my cousin Joey killed himself and he was only eleven.  Anyway. I went through alotta personal-shit around the time of Joey's death. I missed about a week of class and I had a fuckwad french prof. who told me that he was sorry for my loss but that it wasn't his problem.  He was correct, It wasn't, but it still pissed me off that he didn't seem to empathize. That he didn't seem to care. He was from Angola and had witness his own parents assignation at a very young age. He then had the gall to quote some existentialism verbiage a la John Paul Sartre about man's true teleos or prupose ended in dust anyway and how mankind was responsible for his own ass.  Ok, whatever, I had read Sartre, and me being the then academic-pedant that I was had also skimmed through Immanuel Levinas, a jewish-philosopher who was one of Sartre pupils. Levinas theories extrapolate from the ashes of the halocaoust and he agrees very adamantly with Sartre's no-afterlife views on the condition of mankind. Levinas branches off from sartre's bleakness by stating that mankind's true purpose in the world is to the capital-voweled Other or L'autre (in french). This is what intriniscally adds meaning to our lives...having an interface; harboring a rapport with other human beings. Helping them out as they help us out. Trying to cement a feeling of oneness in a planet that no-longer feels period, however terse that feeling may be....  I told my French Prof this and then I told him to have a good day, inserting a few choice vulgarities for affect, telling him to have a nice life. It was too late to officially drop the class and I received a volitional F. However, to this day, that conversation with my french prof. ranks as the most honest thing I've ever said, done or written in a classroom. And if I had to do it all again I would, but of course, I'd save my cousin first....                                        ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3367064,indUnk,"             Kerala is apparently a state with a terrific quality of life index. Wonder how they measured it :-) Obviously they havent seen the TV news lately.  An engineering student commits suicide. Apparently an educational loan was refused by a branch of the IOB. Utter chaos. Left activists have so far burned at least 50 govt vehicles, pelted secretariat and all buildings in its vicinity, conducted innumerous protest marches, and of course demanded the resignation of the ministry. How can the govt be responsible for a student committing murder citing financial reasons? Especially since her entire college fees, mess fees and book fees were funded by them via scholarship. The activists forget to mention that she applied for the educational loan to meet her hostel fees, while she stuck to the working womens hostel instead of a cheaper students hostel. They also forget to mention that she hasnt been to class for close to 11 months. Kerala is a state which has traditionally been proud at its low educational expenses, high index of education and for providing opportunities for the neediest of the needy. It is hard to imagine that this suicide is an indication of a suddenly changing social climate, for the worse.  Well, at least the ruling parties should take some cues from the Opposition on how to blow up issues out of nothing and bring down a ministry in the process.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3362610,indUnk,"       So school is out. It's a bittersweet feeling. I truly miss seeing my friends every day. My last day was really fun tho. I'm gonna be Blincoe's student assistant next year. That excites me cuz I love Blincoe. He's like the coolest teacher ever! And then in photo i just screwed around the whole time. Off block was a lotta fun cuz Mel and Mone came over and we just messed around. Then English was awesome cuz me and Kait and Rissa were just bein dumb the whole time. I'm not friends with Amber and Lindsey anymore. I'm actually pretty happy about that because they are complete and total backstabbers.  They were basically just using me for my house. I wont put up with that from anyone so that doesnt really upset me. I found out they have been talkin shit about me. I really love how girls are so damn two faced. Like seriously its just awesome lemme tell ya. But I'm really startin to think there is something wrong with me. Like I have been invited to at least 2 parties tonight and I really have no interest in going to either one of em. I really dunno why that is, but its pretty weird. So Melanie blew me off last night. I just wanna say thats the last time I'm gonna go outta my way to call her. I'm sposed to hang with Kait tonight but she hasnt called me yet. She better or else I think I might just scream. O god so tonight...at Timmy's graduation party...I saw DREW!!! AHH! It was way awkward for me, but he came over and was talkin to me and wanted to hang out again. I started laughin at him cuz I thought he was kidding! But he said that he wished he lived closer to me so we cud hang all the time! Man he is sooo hot! I'm gonna try to hang with him at least once this summer. That's the only thing I wud want to do. I wud go to Iowa or somethin but I can't cuz of my tattoo.

3359738,Student,"           Yesterday I watched the  WORST  movie I've  ever  seen  in my entire life .  I watched ' urlLink Starship Troopers 2 '. I downloaded it to see how it was. I never really liked the first movie, but it was amusing. Everyone told me the sequel sucked balls, and damn right they were.     Someone must've made a typo. I'm quite certain this movie's called 'Starshit Poopers 2'. What's up with the cover anyway? It looks like a terrible Photoshop job, and don't get me started on the people's [sarcasm]hyper-realistic[/sarcasm] facial expressions.  And I thought ' Elf ' was bad, HA! To make a comparison... this movie makes  urlLink Elf  seem like it had the quality of the goddamn StarWars trilogy (the first trilogy). I'm not kidding you. This is most certainly...  THE WORST MOVIE EVER FUCKING MADE IN THE FUCKING HISTORY OF FUCKING SCIFI FILMOGRAPHY!!!   There are many things I want to mock, err.. tell the world about this movie, let's see...  -  No plot/storyline at all.  This is the story: There's war between humans and bugs on some planet, there's like a group of eight or so soldiers left, and they decide to run and hide in a big bunker building. Then they stay there, not coming out for the whole film. Some aliens infect some of the humans and use them as hosts. Once infected, they're. I really mean, there is zero plotline, mediocre character development.  - The whole movie is filmed with a Sony handycam. You can tell from the video image quality, the feel of the movie's framerate, its responsiveness to blinking lights, and lastly, from the big 'SONY Motion Pictures Systems' logo they put at the end of the credits. (Systems my ass! It was a frikin' handycam!!)  - Shitty acting. Cheesy dialogues.  - It is not just filmed with a handycam, it is also filmed without a stand, therefore the image is shakey during the whole film.  - The whole movie occurs in really dark places to hide the shitty sets.  - At one point, you see a bug's leg dead, stabbed into some thing, from like a previous battle. It looks like made of shitty spray-painted plastic. I've seen fake rubber croissants which looked way more realistic than that insect leg prop.  - The CG is shit. The lighting of the insects and their textures are especially craptastic.  - They couldn't even get the thunderstorm effects right... There is a storm while they're outside, and each time there's lightning, there is a very very faint flash on the people. This was clearly some cheap lights as proper lightning effects use these special lights that shine like hell, like they were a huge flash. The ones in this movie were most likely shitty lights, judging by the very faint light they gave away.  - A guy gets a huge spear, close to the diameter of your fist, right through his chest, and he screams like a total and absolute pussy. (Did I mention that if you get a huge spear through your lungs you can't actually scream? Apparently the suppernatural, puny human here could.) He also prolongued the scream quite a lot. Hell, if you got a huge spear through your chest, you'd die pretty quick.  - There was more pussy screaming after that. Even the exaggerated kind of an unnaturally-prolongated '...AAaaAaAAAaaaaAaAa...'. -- Considering how shit that guy's wounds makeup was, it seemed like the guy had gone into an Italian restaurant, ordered pasta with tomato sauce, and rubbed it on random sides of his face.  - 21 minutes into the movie, I was still wondering what the plot was. Little did I know that by the time the movie ended, I found out there was no actual plot.  - They have a super-realistic radar screen, which apparently is able to detect bugs from anything else, judging by the fact that instead of the usual glowing green dots moving on the screen, there were little cockroach-like bug icons roaming around the radar screen. I guess it was too hard to try and not spoil the only realistic thing in the whole damn movie by changing the dots to bulky bug icons (that can even change direction, as if the radar could tell if one of the bugs turned 90º to its side or not). They should've called it the bugdar.  - The explosions were CG 'cause they couldn't afford a few explosives. The explosions were total and utter crap. They looked super fake. I've seen better rendered explosions in Discovery Channel programmes.  - The weapons have zero backwards thrust when they shoot, or the actors forgot to act like they did. I mean come on, any respectable weapon has at least a little backwards push when it fires something. - And when they fire, guess what the firing looks like... yes, you guessed it, a little flashing light. (A little LED light, I think.) The guns don't do anything when they are fired. They just flash that stupid light. - And also have unlimitted ammo for some reason. (There is not a scene in the whole movie where someone 'recharges' his/her weapon somehow.) - And they are huge and bulky and shoot tiny bullets regardless of wether they're a handgun, or nearly the length of a bazooka. They all shoot sissy bullets. There's like some humungus shotgun that is close to the size of a bazooka and shoots bullets comparable to a simple handgun, WITH a small flashing LED bulb.  - The score doesn't match the movie, and judging by how it sounds, it's a very tiny orchestra... probably less than 12 members. - The sound-editing person was a moron. The voices were wayyyyyy louder than the soundtrack, to the point you don't feel the soundtrack at all.  - There is a shot in the kitchen where the camera moves around a table. The camera man is so bad that you can notice the man walking from the camera's shaking.  - At one point in the movie, two cables got run over, and the whole building gets a powercut and shuts down. May I remind you this is in the future, like 2035, and this building is very strong and hi-tech, and supposed to be a bunker (so there should be emergency systems), yet two mere cables being run over is enough to shut the whole building down? What is this, don't humans know about electricity management in the future?  - They had one night-vision binoculars thingy. The end of it had only one central lens, to appear to be modern. But the actual lens isn't a lens, it is a piece of green plastic, with a light behind it. It's funny when the actors pick it up and do like they're seeing something.  - I was 47 minutes into the movie and like I said before, still wondering what the fuck the plot is. I'm still wondering it now. Oh wait, there isn't one.  - It has such a SHIT ending.  - The blood effects were absolutely crap.  - In one scene, a woman gets hit on her head really badly by a huge object, and a powerful squirt of blood goes on the glass window, then she falls to the ground unconscious, but her head shows no signs of being hit. Not even a cut.  - The camera panning is so cheap. It's clearly a guy holding the handycam and turning it around.  - This movie is classified as Scifi Horror, but it's so terribly shit, that the genre is more like Comedy. It's like watching the Dalek robot movies. Those movies were supposed to be scary back then, but now you watch it and it's like it were 'the invasion of the large rolling trash-cans with a long immobile probes that shoot smoke, who interact with human-sounding monotonous voices, even with each other'. (Why would robots from outer space talk to each other with voice? They can build an enormous UFO, but not a wireless network?) -- Anyway, this blog post is about starshit troopers 2, not the dalek robots, so back to what I was saying...  - At one point, there's a Blade cliche when one of the infected humans attacks this other guy. The guy attacking has full red eyes, Blade-style. The scene's pretty badly acted though.  - oh no, a shitty CG scorpion-cockroach is attacking a black man in his white boxers underwear! ...and one of the guys that is on the floor is making what appears to be orgasm sounds which were supposed to be moans of fear or pain as a number of spiders crawled over him, biting and stuff.  - Near the end there's a pretty shitty spaceshit, err spaceship, probably done as fast as possible in 3dsmax.  - Oh noe, it's action man! -- after the spaceship, a guy jumps out, with two large machine guns, and shoots some bugs or something. Gotta love his shitty neutral facial expression. (Even Terminator had more expression.)  - Near the end, there's one of the guys who is now wearing a robot arm, or more like a large glove. It's very clearly a shitty plastic glove. Did they find it at Toys'R'Us? ...and nice hologram sticker that you stuck on a side of it. Adds a nice touch of mediocrity to the overflowing sack of shit that is this movie.  - Everything in this movie is predictable. Let's put an example... In one scene, a hot naked woman tempts a soldier to come to a shadowy corner. Yes, you guessed it, she's evil due to being infected by the bugs. (This is a very cheesy scene by the way.) Then, guess what she has smeared on her chest, yep, you guessed it, blood. Now guess what's gonna happen... damn, you got it again, the other infected soldiers are surrounding their victim, and while the victim argues in fear, guess what, yep, you're right, someone comes from behind and grabs him.   - Now that I mention the blood effects in the movie... it was really shitty fake blood. It looked like red paint. Actual real blood has a much darker colour, and stains a hell of a lot more than their stupid red dyes.  - In the scene with the naked woman I mentioned a minute ago, the evil man that walks behind the victim decides to cut the guy's throat with a knife. The camera shows us how they cut him, and there is a very tiny amount of blood that comes out of the wound, and then no more blood comes out, while in real life, there would be a HUGE bloodflow and some really disturbing screaming.  - There was a fight scene where some woman starts beating up some infected soldiers, and it's so badly crafted. A few seconds afterwards, it becomes what looks like a cheesy rape scene, then one evil guy stabs a knife on her throat. Of course, the blood looked as realistic as ketchup on some McDonalds fries.  - All bugs can produce screeching sounds, no matter what size. Of course, it would be too hard for the writer of the screenplay (if there's even an actual writer), to realise that no organism can make sounds without some vocal cords.  - In one scene, one of the infected people cuts off someone's head, and it looks like a shitty rubber head. I've seen Halloween masks which looked more realistic.  - In another scene, some bug comes out of one of the dead infected people, out of her head. Her head was full of what I could best describe as strawberry jell-o and some guts of some animal, probably a sheep's intestine, bought at the local meat shop. There is no sight of an actual brain anywhere. Not a trace of it.  - In another scene, an infected woman is set on fire in some closed chamber. Within a second, you see a CG of her, absolutely burnt, with a cartoon-like carbon effect, and yet, still screaming in pain. (Oh, and her eyes magically did not get burned at all, while the rest of her body is all black and burnt. I guess they needed some eyes for us to realise that was her and not some plank of burning wood.) Again, the screaming is very faint. I'm quite certain that if you're being burnt alive you should scream pretty loud.  - What some people said about it: '  When I saw the first 5 minutes I thought that it was fake Because the camera sucked  '  '  THE WHOLE FUCKING FILM SUCKED after 45m i turned it off and complained to blockbuster for even putting it on the shelve and u wanna know what was even more worse? i picked up once apon a time in mexico then saw ST2 on the shelf so i put back once apon a time and picked up ST2 then i got it home and i was like is this a preview or something then it was the whole film i thought actually that some 1 made there own version and stuck the dvd in the case  '  '  I watched it and thought I could have had more of an enjoying time sticking my penis in a light socket.  '  '  If anyone ever asks me what is the worst movie you have ever seen.. I don't think I will even need to think about it..  '  '  I want a screenshot of the scene with the black man on his tight, white boxer shorts, slapping the bugs. That is priceless.  '  - This is pretty funny... at the end of the credits, they put ' The characters and incidents portrayed and the names herein are fictitious, blah blah blah... ' OH REALLY!??!! I THOUGHT IT WAS ALL BASED ON A REAL STORY!!!   - I'd like to quote a  urlLink post  on IMDb.com:  Before the movie started, director Phil Tippett walked out to address the audience (which filled less than 1/4 of the seats). He basically came out to apologize for what we were about to witness. He explained that the studio wanted to keep the Starship Troopers franchise alive, so the picture we were about to view was created. I believe he quoted the budget for the original film to be $140 million. The budget for ST2: $6 million. Do the math.   I do think, however, that with $6 million I could've done a much better movie. And isn't it funny how the actual director apologizes for his creation? I've never heard of that happening before.  I'm thinking I may or may not get some screen captures of the movie to illustrate my review, sometime in the next week or something. I'll let you know if I ever upload some pics.

3359032,indUnk,"   Well not quite, but almost. I was listening to my Maroon 5 album (fantastic band, if you haven't heard of them, find out about them now!) and a track called 'she will be loved' came on. It was one that pulled on me, because it's about someone who has never been by themselves...'she's always belonged to someone else'. I think that's where I've gone wrong. The only time I have been single since I was 15 was for a few months when I was 22/23, and y'know, that says a lot. I bounce from one relationship to another hoping to accidentally stumble across the right one. So when I listen to this song, I'm thinking - she's lucky. At least she's got someone who feels like that!  I kind of make do with what's there at the time instead of aiming a bit higher. I think a lot of people do, and it's sad, but it's like my addiction to sugar. When I was a kid I used to break open the jar with the sugar in it and just eat spoonfuls of it. I remember being in a cafe beside the beach where I used to live, and eating a bowl of sugar cubes that was on the table. Now I've moved on to not being quite so blunt (honest?) about it by piling it into coffee, tea, having chocolate etc. So I'm getting a bit classier with my sugar, so why not my men?  I was writing a personal ad in my head yesterday (I was very bored at work) and I realised that if I actually wrote down my ideal man, I would realise he doesn't exist. I don't know if I've been 'making do' because I genuinely think I can find someone like him given time, or what. I do have this mentality of something better will always come along, but it never is better. I want to be in a situation where I don't *want* anything better. I hope that makes sense. I want to be with someone that I'm wrapped up in, that when I'm with him we're the only two people on earth, I want to pine for him when he's away from me, not be glad for the break!  I've been in a few relationships now. I'm a serial monogamist, and I throw myself entirely into it in the beginning until it starts to go downhill in one way or another. Now please bear in mind that I would give Mr Right my soul (not that he would ask for it) but that's how I am with people I love. So if I go over my big 4, I hope you see that it's not all been my fault. I hope it hasn't anyway. The first one was when I was a teenager and at university and I had my own place. The guy moved in without me noticing. You know...one night here, a t-shirt there...suddenly he was a fixture. He was a student too, and did nothing except play computer games. I was studying for a (hefty) degree and working too, and I'd come home after maybe a 16 hour day to find the place in exactly the same state I left it, although he had the day off, because he hadn't moved from the sofa. Literally. It wouldn't surprise me if he had a glass beside him that he was pissing in to save having to get up for that. Plus he didn't contribute anything to our cost of living. So that was one down, although it took me about a year to get the guts to properly cut him off. Number two got me pregnant within 4 months when I was 20 and then proceeded to abuse me mentally and physically, threaten my friends, my family, and our daughter, and forced me to give up my degree course and all my plans for my life. I remember when I was 7 months pregnant he held me down and stuffed packet after packet of paracetamol in my mouth because I found out he had been cheating on me. His big thing was that his wife had cheated on him - he played on that a *lot* - so for him to be caught out as a cheat was a pretty bad prospect for him and he would have rather have created a fake suicide and killed me and the baby. Luckily (kind of) for me, my body was used to me chucking all sorts of (prescription) things at it, so I threw up, my liver processed the rest, and I got merrily on my way. I have left the city I grew up in, with daughter in tow, because of him, and I will forever be ex-directory and will never register on the electoral roll to eliminate the more obvious ways he could find me. So that wasn't one of the better ones. Number three was going through a divorce with 2 kids and was highly traumatised by it. He was the closest I've ever got to my ideal man, and I absolutely worshipped him, but he wasn't ready for anything. So for my own sake I had to cut that one off. It never really got past the initial fairly casual stages anyway. He still plays on my mind, but I know it would never have worked out. He did help clarify some of what I would be looking for though, so that's a good thing. Number 4 I met through work and I am with just now, and he's bleeding me dry. I pay for everything here, and I don't earn that much. He has a crappy job but plenty of experience to get a much higher paid one, but I think he's just lazy and wouldn't want the responsibility that would come with it. We had agreed on a monthly payment from him to me, but there's constant excuses for why he can't stump it up. So at the moment, I am £4k in debt (£3k more than this time last year) and it's growing steadily. He's a good bloke, don't get me wrong. I don't think he'd ever be unfaithful, but I think that would be more because of the hassle of trying to keep it quiet. He doesn't have a clue why I would want to 1) get a better job 2) move cities to get a better job if necessary 3) possibly complete my degree and change career totally 4) ever have more children 5) ever have sex, for that point. I think my not-so-grand canyon will dry up at this rate. But my daughter likes him, and although I know I could do better (here we go!) I also know I can do much, much worse, because I have. I think my biggest issue is that I can't have a conversation with him. He hasn't read a book since he was at school, and I read ALL THE TIME. He has no interest in anything religious or spiritual, and I'm very curious about it. If I mentioned Beethoven, he'd think I meant the dog. If I try and explain anything to him about anything, he just goes along the lines of 'yeah, whatever'. So it's frustrating, in more ways than one. I feel a sugar headache coming on so I better go and top myself up a bit, and stop frickin whinging! I don't want you to think I'm a moany bitch (although I can be). I might bless you with my 'perfect man' list once I've had my obligatory hot sugar water with a dash of caffeine.  Nessie x  ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3354357,Student,"           faith, mmmmmm.  I used to struggle with the fact that I thought that Christianty was a uniquely western thing, and since I was a westerner that it was just another fascet of my culture that explains how I behave.  It caused me to question everything: my beliefs, my prayer... basically it flipped my world upside down.  I have to ask myself, 'what makes me different, being a Christian, than the next guy? Is that what I'm supposed to do because I am an American'  I questioned this for days.  It was actually the most agonizing three days of my life.  Eventually I learned that Christianity had something different than everything else, first, I didnt have to actually do anything for it, just recieve it.  and two, I have a tangeble thing that non-Christians don't have, the Holy Spirit.  Finally my evidence.   My point in writing that is most christians that go to church all their life, or at least call themselves Christians, don't come to this conclusion.  Then I started thinking thamaybe what I percieve as Chrisitanity is what a lot of people percieve.  I'm under this crazy idea that maybe, just maybe, we are supposed to be living by the spririt and trying to glorify God.  Through this, then we prove God to others, through what the Holy spirit has done through our lifes.  I started looking at what God has done to some of my 'On-fire' Chrisitan friends and that was my proof.  Some of them, there was no damn way that they would change accept for love of God.  So how Chrisitan is societies 'Chrisitian'?  This is where I began to truely realize that things arent nearly what they seem and there is the higher struth out there.  Sorta like in the Matrix, accept I didnt fallow any rabit, and Im not even close to learning Kung-Foo.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3350341,Marketing,"             It is after midnight and thousands of miles away, in Jerusalem, Israel, my beloved 14 year old niece Noa is about to undergo a spinal fusion operation to correct her scoliosis (curvature of the spine). Seventeen years ago, in January 1987, I too had a spinal fusion operation to correct my advanced state of scoliosis. It was a horrible period of my life, but like all of life's hardships, one gets through them and soldiers on. My thoughts are with Noa right now. I am unable to stop imagining her lying in her raised hospital bed preparing to be wheeled in to the operating theater for her 5-7 hour surgery. I know just how she is feeling - it was a mixture of fear, weary anticipation and a sense of just wanting to get it over with. I think harder than undergoing the surgery and recovery, was watching the suffering my parents endured seeing me suffer so. That and the helplessness, being exposed and unable to do a thing for myself for about 10 days after surgery. I couldn't move, I had to lie on my back and rely on nurses to turn me and give me painkillers. It was bloody awful, the memories still linger.  I pray that Noa will have an easier time, medicine has advanced in the past 17 years...kids tend to be up and walking after a day.         B'Hatzlacha Metukah, B'Ezrat Hashem hakol yehiyeh beseder.     Update (Sunday, 3:50pm)  Thank God the operation was a success and Noa is on the road to recovery. She is in a lot of pain and discomfort, but hopefully in time this will subside as her body recovers from the surgery.  SM         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the religious enclave of Bnei Brak, they are now  urlLink segregating streets  - women on the one side, men on the other, and never the two shall meet! Let alone look at eachother. Of course the word 'segregation' automatically gets my hackles up - segregation, apartheid...etc...and the joys of my childhood in South Africa.  Sometimes I feel that religion is the curse of the world - it's a tyranny - zealots killing, wreaking terror in the name of God. How many people have died in the name of Religion?  Still on the topic of religion, I had to give a chuckle at this article in the  urlLink NY Times  (I've given the Maariv link so you don't have to subscribe). It seems there are tiny crustaceans floating around in the NY water supply. If you know anything about Judaic dietary laws, then you know that all crustaceans are not Kosher - no shrimp, lobster, crayfish etc for we Jews!  Anyway, this latest discovery has the collective tits of all NY Jews in a tangle - and water purifying system sales are soaring!  I particularly laughed out loud at the statement describing these organisms as 'little armadillos' - I guess armadillos are not Kosher either? Hmm, I should check! Anyone know if they chew the cud or have cloven hooves? They do have long shnozzes..does that help? :-)  Back to the topic of things South African. Ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is now living it up in South Africa with his family - at the cost of South African taxpayers! I have to agree with this from the SABC (SA Broadcasting Corp):   The Democratic Alliance says South Africa cannot afford to host a leader whose country is 'far removed from our national interest'. Objecting to the arrival of Aristide in Johannesburg, Douglas Gibson, the DA spokesperson, said the money spent on hosting the deposed leader would have been better spent on poor people's needs.   With one in five South Africans HIV positive, and in dire need of medical services, the idea of hosting Aristide at the country's expense is offensive and unconscionable! Go home Aristide, wherever the fuck home is or pay your own way!

3348302,indUnk,"             There is a girl who works at a Blockbuster by my house. I went in there today to buy a movie and she served me. Now, I know what good customer service is but you can go overboard and just be plain creepy. She was making a huge spectacle out of serving me (as she did everyone before me and I'm sure everyone after). At first I was stunned, then I got angry because I thought she was being a sarcastic little bitch, then I got worried that maybe today was her day to snap and lose her shit because she had been a Blockbuster employee for too long, then I got defensive, and then finally I just got really fucking confused. She was loud, TOO happy, saying catch phrases from different films where she could, waving her arms all over the place... She practically yelled to me, 'And this has to be back NEVER' and then proceeded with a crazy fish-hooked smile saying, 'You have a nice day!!!'. Then as I walked away I noticed her taking a moment of quiet time and humming before turning and beginning again for the next customer. This girl is scary. She makes me want to run out of there and once I hit the sidewalk just keep on running all the way home. She has served my room-mate before too and also scared him, and he is not too easily scared. Maybe I'll start going to the Rogers store where I won't be afraid of an employee going ape-shit because they can't handle their job.  On another note: my Bundy family neighbors are insane and, as I can imagine usually comes along with insanity, extremely inconsiderate. They are tearing up the walkway between our houses that leads to both our yards. Neither our landlord nor us were notified of this. So I was woken up way too early this morning thinking that something awful was going on because my entire house was shaking. They were fucking jack-hammering away all of the cement and going in along the line of the foundation of our house. All day that jack-hammer went, all day my house shook and shook. Now they have all the broken cement pieces and dirt piled along the sidewalk in front of our houses, all their trash cans and recycle bins piled on our lawn, and our walkway completely blocked off. After feeling bitter about all of this I've decided to come up with a couple plans of how piss them off:  -put poo in the miniature farm house mailboxes that we love so much -put all the pieces of broken cement together flat like a jigsaw puzzle covering their front lawn as a present for them in the morning -every night my room-mates and I take turns running and peeing on the same spots on their front lawn so eventually they would have little yellow doodles in the grass of their 'perfect' lawn  I know there are a million more but I'm too tired and drunk to think of them right now. Maybe I should just let my landlord  (who absolutely hates my neighbors) take care of it... but how much fun is that for me? Besides, I'm the one suffering psychological trauma from having to see that tacky woman in next to no clothes every day so it only seems fair.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3348160,Government,"                 Ah things have just been settling down for me over the past week or so. I am still working two jobs; one at the Hatboro Police Department, the second at Temple University. Recently, actually it was this past Wednesday, I found out that I was to be hired this upcoming Monday at Bristol Borough Police Deparment as a police officer. Obviously, I was quite excited when I found this out because I have been trying to get a police officer job for about a year now. If anyone does not know what it is like to get a cop job it is a very long and selective process with many interviews and test (polygraphs, physicals, etc.). Ok, so before I go on the Chief of the department told me himself over the telephone that I was to be hired, and sworn in on Monday.    Now here is the part where it feels like to be shit on  .  Last night the Detective for Bristol Borough Police Department calls me on the telephone and requests my presence at the station at 11AM this morning. I was thinking 'great, time to sign some paperwork, and go over everything before Monday) but  NO!  this was not the case at all.  Conversation:  Det:   Stephen close the door   . (A nasty tone)   Det:   Sit down  .  Me:  Ok .  Det:   We have a problem  .  Me:  What's that .  Det:   You lied on your original application  .  Me:  Pardon me .  Det:   You stated that you have never served in the military before, however, when you took the polygraph test, you claimed to have been discharged from the United States Navy on the premis of having asthma.    Me:  Thats correct. I was discharged from bootcamp after having two asthma attacks .  Det:   Why did you answer 'no' to this question that asks if you have ever been discharged from the military for medical reasons.    Me:  Well, correct me if I am wrong sir, that question appears in a section where it states 'do you claim veterans preference points', in turn I answered no to this questions due to the lack of active duty time.   Det:   Ok, well you are wrong. This question appears before the veterans preference points question.    Me:  May I see my application? (Det hands me the application) Oh, ok, I appeared to have misunderstood the question.   Det:   How could you possibly misunderstand the question!?!? It clearly states what it is asking for. You lied, and if you lie we eliminate you from the hiring process.     (Keep in mind I was told on Wednesday night that I was to be sworn in on Monday night, and I had taken a polygraph test over 3 weeks ago, which I  passed  with flying colors ).  Me:  Oh, sorry, just made an honest mistake. I thought the question came under the section under the veterans points category thats why I did not answer the questions/put 'no' for various military questions.   Det:   Well we see this as you are lying. And if you are going to lie about one thing, this is usually a precurser to lying on police reports, and to other officers.      Me:    What!   I have written over a thousand police reports at my present job, and have never, and would never falsify a police report. I have disclosed everything in my past, and present on the polygraph test which, you told me yourself that I was truthful. One of the questions was 'Did I lie on my original application for employment' which I answered 'no' and the test showed I was not being decietful.   Det:   Well, we are are sorry Stephen, but the Chief and I have already discussed this and we decided not to pursue you anymore for an employee. However, you may reapply after six months.    Me:  Sir, excuse me for being blunt but why the hell would I lie about being discharged from the military for asthma? I disclosed information to you about my past drug use, and all of the crimes I have committed in the past. I have nothing to hide from you now, nor have I lied to you or anyone else during this entire process. I made an honest mistake. I have included my military record on over 10 other job applications. I disclosed it when I went to the academy. For what reason do you think I would hide this from   this   department?   Det:   I am sorry, our policy is that if you lie once during this whole process you are done. You are done. I am however going to have one more meeting with the chief before we make our final decision, but I do not think the outcome will be in your favor. Thank you for coming in, and good luck with the rest of your career.    Me:  Ok. Thank you .  This meeting ruined my day, week, months. This was very unfair.  I will post the final result.   This is what it feels like to be shit on .              ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3346836,Chemicals,"       My friend JK is here, she got in last night, there was a staff party at the club I work for so she met me there.  As soon as she got into the city she was at a club, having sushi for dinner and drinking from an open bar.  I think that was a good way to welcome her.  We went out after that.  Drum & Bass, some Bolivian marching powder and free drinks.  I can have fun no matter where I am, as long as there's booze involved, and when it's free booze I'm set.  I worked yesterday.  I haven't really worked in months.  I helped sell jewellery at the tattoo shop where my friend works.  I really just sat around for eight hours talking to girls and playing with a wiener dog.  I was supposed to be working again right now but the guy who owns the shop decided that I was unnecessary.  I'm not sure if I didn't sell enough or maybe the business wasn't good enough to pay an extra person for sitting around.  Either way the situation is irritating, I really could have used the money.  I still have not resolved the problem with my apartment.  I'm trying to break my lease at the end of the month, I don't think it's going to happen.  These cocksuckers have been jerking me around non-stop.  When I signed the lease, the landlord told me that if I wanted to break it I would just have to give one month's notice.  That landlord quit working for the company and I was not informed.  When I found out who the new landlord was and managed to talk to her, it was June first.  I told her that I wanted out of the lease, she said that I could pay this month's rent in cash and she would give me a letter breaking the lease.  She said she wanted cash so that she could be sure that I didn't give her a bad cheque.  I had five hundred dollars cash, she apparently had the letter.  We had issues connecting with each other and before we had the chance to meet, she quit her fucking job with the company that owns the building.  I'm thinking that it's a good thing that we didn't meet, she could have been planning to fuck me over with a useless letter and pocket the cash.  Fucking sneaky little bitch.  I managed to meet the elusive owner of the building by chance last Thursday.  I explained the situation to him, he said that nobody should have told me that I can break my lease with one month's notice.  He said that a letter would be dropped off the next day to all tenants with new contact info for the new building management company.  He told me to call him on Monday.  The Interpol-associated super was there during this conversation.  There was no letter on the day promised so I had no phone number come Monday.  I talked to the super and she refused to give me his number even though she was present when he told me to call him.  I wanted to smash her fucking skull in with a brick.  After I bitched for awhile she called him and let me leave a message, the voice mail system cut me off halfway through what I was saying.  I was livid.  I told the super to get in touch with him and tell him to call me.  A few days after that, the letter is finally delivered.  I call the company and ask for the person in charge of this building, get transferred to some woman I've never heard of, who is not even in her office at the time, and leave her a fucking message.  That was a couple days ago and I haven't heard anything back.  In fact, I haven't heard anything from anybody I've tried to talk to.  I'm pissed off.    These people are a bunch of cum-guzzling shitbags.  They can eat a huge bowl of dicks as far as I'm concerned.  I'm getting fucked over here and they're doing it by giving me the silent treatment.  I'd like some straight answers from someone who is in a position to actually do something, not some bullshit superintendent who works for the pigs.  I intend to be on the road back to Toronto in ten days.  I need a solution to this problem now.  These disorganized borderline slum lords deserve to be skull-fucked.  I've even tried another approach, I've tried bribing the super.  When people come to look for apartments to rent, she shows them.  I've offered her cash if she rents out mine before an empty one.  She didn't say no, and when I mentioned it in the hallway the other day she told me to be quiet, she didn't want anybody to hear because it's illegal.  She wouldn't act this way if she wasn't open to the idea, she wants discretion.  I'm not sure how wise it is to bribe someone who works for Interpol, but fuck it, it's done now.  She still hasn't done anything about it though and time is a factor.  I'm irate.  I can't wait to get back to Toronto.  I've had just about enough of this place.  The move was worth it in many ways, but I'm fed up.  I've really mastered the art of escapism in the past few months.  Usually I use alcohol, but I think I'll go grab some PCP tonight.

Thanks to the technology of today we are bombarded with images of war every day both on TV as well as magazines and Internet access to sites such as CNN.  It seems as if there is nothing that escapes our perview. The only way we can escape the harsh realities of life and the human sufferings of others is to deny ourselves any type of media consumption.  How often do we do that?    I believe that because we have such instant access to the violence all around us that we have become desensitized to the pain and anguish of others all around us.  That goes for the drive by shooting in North Charleston to the wounded soldier in Baghdad.  We hear reports of random violence every single day and we are far removed from becoming emotionally involved.  We tell ourselves that yes the world is a violent place to live in BUT it is happening to THOSE people and not me or my family.  Some of us kid ourselves into thinking that we dont have to worry about it happening to us. We rationalize that because we are who we are or because of where we live we surround ourselves with a false sense of security and hope in that those things will not happen to us.   I come from a family of men who have served their country.  They served their country and went wherever they were sent and did whatever they had to do to stay alive and come back home to their families.  It is so easy for us to sit back and be arm chair politicians and analyze the validity of where our men and women are sent.  Intellectually we say we count the cost and we realize that some of those men and women will give their lives so that we can have the privelege and right to be arm chair politicians and critics of our government and their policies.  This article is not designed to take a political view point or to decide for us IF we should be where our men and women are fighting in Iraq.  What this article does is it snaps us back into reality and helps us to count the cost of freedom.  Men and women are being killed, maimed and tortured in the name of freedom.  If it was your son or daughter that was over there dodging bullets or wondering if they were going to live another day because of worry about landmines, suicide bombers or car bombs then your perspective on the war would probably be much different.    Take time out this morning or whenever it is that you read this and say a heart felt prayer for both the men and women that are fighting for our right to be FREE in America and for those families that have loved ones that are SERVING us with their very life blood on foreign soil.  The LEAST that we can do is PRAY to God and ask HIM for HIS devine guidance and protection for our men and women.  The next thing we can do is to be sensitive to the needs of those family members that are here and are missing their spouses or sons and daughters wherever it is they have been deployed to.  If those people knew that we are proud of their family members for serving our country and were willing to atleast give them some of our precious time to just listen to them or help out in some small way I know that it would help them tremendously.    Lets pray that somehow this campaign of terror that America is involved in fighting will somehow be resolved so that our men and women can come home once and for all.  I know that might be an unrealistic hope or dream but atleast we can HOPE.              ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3344990,Education,"                  It is so wet that even the ducks have gone to higher ground.  If I had not been unemployed for the last 7 months I would go buy some gold fish to stock the ponds of water all around us.  We moved back to Boggy Creek (aka Duck Ditch) on August 23rd and I think it has rained every single day since then.  So, Duck Ditch will be Boggy Creek until the water is absorbed some more and the ducks wander back down to our little commune.  If you live in Duck Ditch there has to be ducks right?  I cant count the ducks that live at my neighbors house.  Those ducks are here whether they like it or not. If they could fly I am sure they WOULD fly away to higher and more dryer land.    I am on vacation until this next Monday.  Actually, my 7 month vacation ends then.  You either have more time than you have money or you have more money than you have time.  I would opt to have the later now that I have experienced 7 months of the former.  On Monday I will be employed by ADT in their business sales team.  Instead of asking you if you want fries with that hamburger I will ask you if you want motion sensors or more door sensors with that basic security package.  I dont think that I will be able to ask folks if they want to 'biggie size' it or not.  :)  The only time I say that I want to biggie size anything is when I go out and try to find pants for myself.  Sigh.....  Lets not go there please....  In an effort to reduce the tent size of my waist line I have promised myself that I WILL go out and walk Monday through Friday for exercise. Today is Monday and guess what.  I have already blown it.  I walked Monday and then went bowling on our winter league for the first night and then my body started to punish me.  I never knew that my brain could receive that many signals from the different body parts all at once.  Katy told me that I was brain dead to be out walking just for the sake of getting exercise.  Maybe she has something there.  :) Luckily for me and my desire to loose some weight my new job will be just the ticket.  Between 10 am and 4pm Monday through Friday I will be out and about prowling around looking for potential customers which means walking from one business to another trying to make NEW friends.  Friends with money to spend and security needs to fulfill.  I can make money (hopefully) and loose weight at the same time.  What else can I ask for?  I spoke to Katy this morning and it is amazing what has happened in less than 3 weeks.  Here is a short list of what God has allowed to happen.  I say that because I did not have anything to do with it.   A. Moved us from Travelers Rest to Goose Creek  B. Allowed us to go back to our home church C. Allowed us to be around people who love us and care D. We are back in the house we originally moved out of when we left E. Our friends and landlord is helping us with regards to rent and utilities.  (HUGE PTL there) F. Katy has  a dishwasher again (Katy LOVES that) G. Katy has a washer and dryer that was donated by Cindy (Thanks Cindy) H. The church loaned us the 25' color TV that we donated to the church until I can buy another one.  I.  I have a new job starting Monday J. The children are enrolled in Public school  k. I have new opportunities for service at Grace Fellowship Church L. Grace Fellowship Church membership has almost doubled since we left.  That means growth, challenges and opportunity  Well anyway, I might have forgotten some of the details but you can see that we have a LOT to be thankful for.  We do not believe in circumstance but we do believe that God has his hand in every aspect of our lives.  If God is for us WHO can be against us?  NO ONE.  What can separate us from the Love of God?  NOTHING......    Yes, I am doing the happy dance.  Thanks for letting me share some POSITIVE & HAPPY stuff with you.  Thanks for the prayers and the support.  God is GOOD all the time!

Don't understand, really don't understand... why do i always have to be so lonely? am i destine to be this way? no matter how hard to try, no matter how hard i change, it seems nothing has changed.   People always say sorry, but nothing gonna change, saying sorry and expect nothing had happened, and arent gonna change their mistakes as well.. so what is the point of saying sorry when nothing can be done, when nothing can be changed or nothing is going to changed?  I try so hard to change myself, i really tried... people are greedy and ask for more.. so i give them more and they want more... i always try to satisfy them cos i know i needed a fren, a companion, who will give me abit of concern, who will standby me and lend me their listening ear... no one, no one could do that for me! why? don't understand, really confused.. what have i done to deserve this kinda treatment? what have i done to deserve this kinda loneliness?   Day after day, month after month, years after years... i have been waiting, waiting for a companion... now im getting very tired of waiting already... really tired of waiting... been so lonely for so many years... why do i felt so lonely? why do i have to wait for so long, so long?

3336397,Student,"       Choices I spoke about it sometime before in a post. I read it somewhere that we mostly limit our choices to two and that is why we tend to be sometimes negative in life.If we try to broaden the options into three or four we could be make our life easier for us and for the people we care about.I have a big problem with choices, simply some choices are just not fair. For example if you have two options and both options are just too close to the heart and that is the time when u just hate yourself , cause you just want to delay the choice simply because it is just too hard and too hurtfull.  That is what growing up is all about i think, to enable yourself to make hard choices in life. Sometimes it involves a carrer decision , a marriage decision or a love decision and i can say like a number of more but then the blog would be just too small to fit it in :). I do tend to regret choices, but i know i had made it and that itself is a part of accepting responsibility which is trust me so hard to do.  Experiences is one more part which just makes you a grown up. Will you be a grown up in a bad way or a good way, that itself is a personal CHOICE. Again the debate could be what is bad in my eyes would not be bad in your eyes, it is a matter of perception. Experience in my eyes is the most priceless possesion a man or a woman can have. Thousand book would not teach you what experience would. It is like a simple think you could have read about how work is but you know the meaning of work when you actually do it. I am not implying here that a person should not read, don't take me wrong here. In fact i think being well read is very important as it is impossible to experience everything first hand, but that should not excuse you to know about it and that is why books are such a valuable knowledge that you just cant trade it in with anything.  UK as a country as made me grow up (i dont know abt bad or good). It has given me an oppurtunity to feel diversity first hand, it has made me more tolerant, it has made me more sensitive but yet insensitive if that makes any kind of sense, it has made me appreciate the small and big things in life and most of all it has taught me to be independent (or i may hope so) This country has given me a varierty of experiences both good and bad which i would have not dreamt of even comming close to it in India. One thing whihc i will always thank this country would be that i was introduced to the world of academia from this country which is just so vast and so good .I have just pointed out some experiences, it just given me too much to think about for my whole life. And most of all ithas given me the most beautiful and most dreaded thing in the world. I will keep you guessing.....           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3336111,indUnk,"       For those of you who don't know, my dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer about a month ago.  We're fortunate because it is a very treatable cancer and it has been caught in the early stages. Treatments include surgery or radiation.  Dad decided to go with surgery and went under the knife last Wednesday morning. Everything went well and he was given his release papers on Friday morning, painkillers in hand.  Unfortunately, one of the side effects of said painkillers is extreme nausea and it can really screw up your digestive system.  He started feeling bad on Friday night and by Saturday evening, he was extremely miserable.  Under the advice of his doctor, he went back to the hospital so that they can get him back on track. While it is not as serious as it could be, it's still rather stressful, especially for my mom.  I'm afraid she is going to crash soon.   Spending time in the hospital, and seeing some of the people there, makes me realize how fortunate my family really has been.  Even with dad's cancer, things could be a lot worse.  On a lighter note, I've started running.  I've been feeling miserable lately and needed to get back into a work out routine, so I bought a new pair of Nike's.  I do better when motivated by spending money.  There is a path along the sea wall that is set up for runners/walkers, bikers, etc to use. It even has the 10th of the miles marked off on it.  I figured that I won't be able to run by the sea at sunset in Baton Rouge, so I need to enjoy this while I can.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3333514,Publishing,"           Yesterday, stiff, sore - still recovering from Monday night's yoga class. No new poses introduced, but finally learning to do the ones I thought I knew right. Videos and DVDs only take you so far. Nothing like the teacher wandering around between students offering corrections to help get your poses right. Also - when she wanders around the room we end up holding the pose for twice as long - or so it seems.   So I got a little more out of the various Warrior poses - my quads and shoulders were actually shaking. I thought that was kind of embarrassing, but at least I didn't fart. Yes, that's right. Two classes so far and each week someone farts - really loud! Considering how much twisting and squeezing we do I'm surprised I don't hear more. I reserve my 'noises' for grunts and groans.

Shetland, the Zetlandic Archipelago, capital city, Coalfishreek...I miss it. Well, most of the time. All right, some of the time. I have to admit that Tuesday night's restaurant and pub crawl around Aberdeen was pleasant, with balmy weather and the company of two briefly beached Shetland residents, Joe and Paul. Nice pint of IPA at Under the Hammer (Shetlanders at the next table), then dinner at the excellent Bistro Verde (scallops and halibut, cooked to perfection) followed by a pint of something called Lusty May at the legendary Prince of Wales. Rounded off with (for me) a second viewing of Shawn of the Dead at Vue. Funnier than the first time.         The Jim Beam (white label) at home was a mistake. There's something weird about bourbon.

3325749,indUnk,"       Well I'm ready to throw my hands up in the air once again and say f&%$# it all.  guess you must be saying..now what happened.  Well let me push the rewind button....Last nite...date with Mr Principal.  We were originally suppose to go for coffee and then he had got off work early so he asked if I wanted to go for dinner so I said sure...why not.  I met him at the restaurant...quiet spot in the place...was a nice setting.  I ordered a cosmopolitan..mmmm good  lol  Then he arrived.  I don't know what I expected but he was alright...Pudgy tummy.  Reminded me a bit of Peter.  But once we started talking...I knew right away this was the first and last date with him.  He just kept talking about himself, his travels, hardly looked at me in the eye.  At this point...I was thinking about what I could be doing if I were not sitting there with him.  He went on and on about his 'female' friends  blah blah blah...whenever I would open my mouth he would switch the conversation back to him...Also found out he lives with his mother....oh god..what is up with men moving back home.  After 2 hrs of this torture (good meal though) we left the place.  We stood uncomfortable and had small talk outside and then I thanked him for dinner and say g'nite...he asked if I wanted a ride home but I lied and said I had some shopping to do lmao... Oh well  bye bye Mr. Principal.  G called me when I was in the mall and asked what I was doing.  Played his own game by telling him I was shopping with Nellie...he said for me to call him when I got back home which I did...the  first thing out of his mouth was that he was craving me and wanted to know if he could come over by cab.  Hey why not...lol  He came over...we screwed like rabbits and then went to sleep.  He left this morning.  Day started well...until he decides to call me and got into a conversation about what we're doing.  I personally think that he had set up a date himself and that he didn't want his guilty concious bothering him.  I told him that I luv him but I am not going to beg for him to be in a relationship he doesn't want to be in.  We agreed we would try again to stop contacting eachother in order to move on.  he called back three times but I didn't want to talk anymore.  F$#%^^ this sh*&  I'm so tired of this crap with regards to men.  I need to get back into myself and stop the mission to try and find a man.  One will come along when I least expect it ((i hope))  I hate being alone.  But I'm also not going to settle for just anyone.

I demand all my weather investment money back now.   Along for the ride we had Mario De Clercq, the 'retired' Johan Verhagen and one of his mates, who is built like a tank. It was the usual Sunday parcours, which has a few hills in it but is not as hard as Saturday. We did the 58 km in 1:26 which I reckon is not too shabby. The three aforementioned were the ones mainly responsible, and it didn't surprise me that we only had 10 riders left on the Trap Op.

3321827,Technology,"             Americans should reform elections so every vote counts   As Americans gear up for the Nov. 2 presidential election, they might ask themselves if their vote will really matter — because if they don’t live in one of 17 battleground states (like Michigan), it won’t.    It didn’t count during the primary season, either, unless they lived in Iowa, New Hampshire or a couple of other early-to-vote states. And if they vote in a congressional race, their choice won’t matter unless they live in just one of 35 congressional districts. The other 400 districts have been gerrymandered to guarantee the re-election of the incumbent.    The sad truth is that millions of Americans are being disenfranchised by the archaic architecture of an outmoded electoral system. It’s time to fix it.    In the Federalist No. 10, written in 1787, James Madison warned that “democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security, or the rights of property....” Madison was a republican, with a small “r,” who wanted “the delegation of the government ... to a small number of citizens elected by the rest.”    But even the elitist Madison might be surprised at just how few votes count in electing a president today.    Look at the current campaign. The balkanization of America’s polity into red and blue states, and the winner-take-all Electoral College mean that the 2.4 million Democrats in Texas and a combined 85 million Republicans in New York and California will have no political representation. All the electoral votes Texas casts will probably go to President George W. Bush, and all the votes California and New York cast will probably go to John Kerry. The result — dissenting voices go unrepresented.     Since the country is evenly split between red and blue states, presidential candidates focus more of their time and money persuading a smaller number of voters in a shrinking number of competitive swing states to vote for them.    In the ‘70s, up to 40 states were in play in presidential years. Today, it’s down to 17 or 18. A BusinessWeek analysis shows that Ohio, Florida and Missouri will have clout utterly disproportionate to their population.    Worse, it is possible that either candidate could triumph in the popular vote and lose in the Electoral College. A Florida reprise would create a serious crisis of legitimacy in America. No wonder people feel alienated from the political system to the point where voter participation is down to 54.5 percent — 139th among the world’s 172 democracies.    There is an obvious solution: one person, one vote. Americans indulge the Electoral College but do not subscribe to the principles behind its creation. Madison and the Founding Fathers wanted an Electoral College to temper majority rule and to preserve the power of small agrarian and slaving-owning Southern states. Today, Americans are perfectly capable of electing their own president. Direct popular elections or proportional voting for Electoral College representatives are long overdue.     But more is needed. An astonishing 98.2 percent of incumbents won re-election to the House of Representatives in 2002. Thanks to gerrymandering, there is less competition and more polarization than ever. Computers allow politicians to sift through demographic data to create convoluted election districts that divide, conquer and bury opponents.    Candidates are then chosen in primaries dominated by core left-wing Democrats or right-wing Republicans. It all means less competition and more polarization. No wonder there are so few moderates left in American politics.    Gerrymandering is an electoral monster killing U.S. democracy. Redistricting should be taken out of the hands of politicians and given to nonpartisan panels that draw reasonable districts and give incumbents no special edge. Iowa has done this since 1981 and has the country’s most competitive House districts.    Low turnout may be fine for the pols and ideologues who dominate the process, but it isn’t fine for the rest of the nation. Special interests support incumbents, and challengers must be rich to have a chance of winning.    Alexis de Tocqueville, chronicler of all things American, was never more prescient than when he characterized the collision of egos and beliefs that is a U.S. election. What this admirer of a young nation’s vibrant institutions could not have predicted, however, was that one day the delicate machinery of the Founders’ design would break down, creating a serious destabilizing condition.    Increasingly, votes don’t matter in the United States. Fewer competitive races, increased political balkanization, more big-money politics and the absence of a true popular vote for the president are making a mockery of America’s democratic ideals. We must do better.    I agree with the premise of this article.  Though the 2000 election was more favorable to my views in that Gore was defeated (notice, I didn't say that Bush won), I believe that the Electoral College is hopelessly outdated.  Before the Information Age, the Electoral College was likely a necessity and insured that candidates fought for every state.  This is no longer the case.  The only problem I have is that it doesn't go far enough.  The current electoral process is so stacked against any 3rd party that it is nearly impossible to have a 3rd party candidate listed on the ballot.  Mere exposure on the ballot would help a 3rd party (such as the Libertarian Party) gain legitimacy...and votes.  Obviously, candidates from the 2 major parties do NOT want a 3rd party candidate...they fear the 'none of the above' vote.  Unfortunately, this will continue until people get pissed off enough at BOTH parties that they will flock to a 3rd party...we just aren't there yet.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3321425,indUnk,"       I was coming home from work earlier this week when a boy sat next to me in the bus; he was dressed in a neat white collar shirt and straight black trousers; I think I knew what he was even before he started talking. Earlier in life I would have been intimidated by someone who wanted to talk about something very personal to me, but this boy radiated such innocence and calm that I was intrigued to continue the conversation.  I was almost sorry when I had to get off at my stop.   He asked me a set of questions - do I believe in God? What is the purpose of life? Have I ever seeked a meaning to my existence or looked for God? Have I ever tried talking to God? Spirituality or faith are nobody else's business, so I regretted that we were in a crowded bus instead of somewhere more appropriate for such a conversation.   I told him that for now, I've settled for 'quiet disbelief' and he repeated the words after me, seemed to be amused or amazed at the thought - maybe just the choice of words.   My problem with God, gods, faith, or spirituality is not the actual ideas, but with the institutionalising of them. When things get written down they become inflexible – in the hearts and minds of men they start to represent an absolute truth; something solid and unchangeable. In my heart I know this is  not  what religion should be about.  And yet, don't get me wrong; religion can be the saviour the church would have you believe it is – my own step-brother was what you could call a lost soul before he found God. He's now a priest, and happily married; I haven't spoken to him for a long time, but I have the feeling that he is happy and at peace with the world and that can only be a good thing.  While I was talking to this golden-haired, befreckled boy in the bus, I felt that he was indeed a 'child at heart' in the sense the Bible teaches, and it was truly a beautiful thing.   And yet I couldn't help but wonder if his faith was coming from the heart; or whether he was just living by a book, taught to him by his church and his family. Did he come to this faith by truly finding a god, or merely by external initiation? What made him leave home to come to Denmark to share the message of his Lord, Jesus Christ the Saviour?  These days people tend to forget how important it is to have a dialogue with representatives of different ideologies; people who have their heart open for a discussion without trying to sell their ideals to you; people who believe in what they feel is true, even when it is completely different to what you believe. The key to peace is not in agreement, but in understanding.   I'm not sure if the encounter with the missionary was a random one; it set me thinking about spirituality and the things I actually do believe in. In a way, his mission was successful, even if my conclusion wasn't the one he was hoping for.  Do I believe in God? No.  I don't believe that there is a conscious entity of divine proportions out there who has capacity for love and judgement.   My own spirituality – though still fragile – is based on what my own heart has experienced. I would say I believe in the capacity of the common person to live in harmony with their surroundings and accomplish happiness not through achievements but through personal evolution. But those are just fancy words for saying  'I believe in life.'    * * *   Although otherwise common as muck,  Laura  claims the title of the Queen of Procrastination. She's also an expatriate Finn who spends most of the time inside her own head - out of which the words overflow on their own accord.

3305189,Technology,"         urlLink Via Anne van Kesteren :  urlLink Dean Edwards  discovered a way to get Internet Explorer to  urlLink display XHTML correctly when sent as  application/xml  .  However, Dean  urlLink commented  that there were some problems worth note:   apparently it doesn't work too well with ASP/JSP, although i haven't tested it myself.  ...  it doesn't work with the XHTML1.1 DTD. (it chokes on an entity reference)   Since I am an avid ASP.NET developer, I decided to drop Dean an e-mail asking more about the ASP/JSP thing. He then referred me to  urlLink Rob Collyer , who came back to me with some rather interesting information. I quote some stuff below out from the e-mail he sent me:   Hi Charl...  The issues I've found is that Internet Explorer working inapplication/xml mode, will not pass on the referrer string to pages.This is slightly annoying if your pages use the referrer string to trackusers around your site, or to make sure they have come by a certainroute into a secure area, etc.  The above issue can be worked round with tweaks at the server end...Embedding referring page names into querystrings, or forms, etc (notvery sightly in querystrings, I must say)  The above also, wont affect many sites, but it's something to consider.  The second and most major issue I've had, is that when you refresh apage that's had http POST data posted to it...  Normally, explorer (and all other browsers) politely asks you if youwant to repost the data.In application/xml mode, it does not ask you this at all, and it DOESNOT repost the data which is very annoying to the user (especially onmulti-page forms.... It would be a big issue in .NET, as the webformswould lost state and postdata, and isPostBack would always return falsefor a refreshed form.  So as long as you are prepared to code round the referrer issue, and tomake all form actions a GET instead of POST, then you will probabally beok.  I personally, would just sniff the q value, and serve up content basedon what the q values actually request as their preferred content-type...Eg..  Give IE html 4.0 strict / transitional, and everything whose qvalue asks for it, XHTML.  Ie, was never supposed to be XHTML compliant, and the fact that Dean hasfound a clever work-around is remarkable, but not without issues asdescribed above....   I personally, would not like to see this hack perpetuated nor anythingthat keeps Internet Explorer's heavy head above water... It would be farbetter to leave Internet Explorer to take its current path to rack andruin, and then maybe one day when either Microsoft release a better andcompliant version, or when they lose their foothold in the browsermarket, our lives as web developers will be much easier (c'mon, you hatecoding xBrowser IE issues too don't ya?)  Leave standard-skirting browsers in the past where they belong, and helpspread the word of mozilla, firebird and opera.  That's just my personal opinion of course.  Cheers,  Rob   Ok, so I quoted the entire e-mail. I hope Rob doesn't mind.  At this moment I don't really think that it is viable in practice to use this technique, because there are many bugs as Rob pointed out, and the advantages are not really too clear. (Except for the fact that you can now send pages under a single content type to all browsers.)  Also note that you  should  actually send XHTML as  application/xhtml+xml  for many reasons.  Another thing that  urlLink came to mind  is how this would work with search engines. I don't really know if Google recognizes the important tags like  title  that are important for search engine optimization when it is sent as XML. That would probably depend on Google's XHTML/XML compatibility, but nobody really knows too much about this yet.  So, probably still best to stick with  text/html  for non-XHTML/XML user agents. Very interesting experiment though. Congratulations, Dean!  Oh yes, and before I forget, I like to hear more people (like what I quoted from Rob above) saying that we should leave Internet Explorer behind and design for Mozilla and Opera in full XHTML glory. The only problem is that this isn't viable for commercial sites, but for personal sites I say: Go right ahead! I plan on making some Internet Explorer-incompatible websites myself within the next few weeks. I'll keep you posted!          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'That day apparently coincided with your business trip?'  David heard the trace of suspicion coloring his voice and apparently Mindy heard it too.  She looked at him as if he had just suggested she had bought her clothes at Wal-Mart.  'It wasn't planned David.  God dammit do you really think I've been lying to you all this time?'  At that moment her eyes started to fill with tears.  David watched in wonder as Mindy switched to the role he had watched her perform so many times for other people, but he had never had the opportunity to witness the magic, or in her case tragic,  transformation first hand.  He couldn't believe she was going to use the 'manipulation tears', as he called them, on him!  She must really be desperate if she was resorting to that poor me act.  He'd watched her practice the look in front of the mirror before going to court for a speeding ticket or on her father when she needed to borrow some money..though that was long before she started making it big in real estate.  He even found himself wondering if the tears that had first captured his heart that he saw her shed at his sister's wedding had been fabricated as well.  He was beginning to feel as if he didn't know her at all.  'Cut the bullshit Mindy!  You know I'm not gonna fall for that so let's just skip the little girl lost routine and finish this conversation.'  David pounded his fist on the counter next to him in frustration.  Though the physical release of pain made him feel momentarily better, the pulsing of his hand only served to mock him for losing control.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean, i see your point - what better way to celebrate than be heavily reminded that your loved one could die any second over there? Bring on the fear.  Also... freedom is not free, whether it's Americans' freedom or Iraqis' freedom. We're all citizens in this global community. You said it makes you sick to see the dead children and civilians. Let's realize that Saddam Hussein was even worse...  Furthermore, servicemen *also their families* should not complain about this war. If they had been drafted involuntarily, it would be entirely different, but signing up for the armed services means pledging yourself to following the leader. You get many beneifts, but it's not meant to be a FREE RIDE as many take it to be. There's a reason you get such a big deal, and that's because you've signed up to possibly be called to put your life on the line.   I don't know why Bush had to invade looking for 'weapons of mass destruction.' Why couldn't Hussein just be kicked out for being evil? The UN seems like a bunch of BS to me right now.

I like both of them as a friend, and I don't care if the time were to come where I'd eventually end up going out with one of said chicks. But it seems to me [sure I could and most likely be wrong..] they're making me choose.  A friend of mine who graduated decides to gloat all about his prom to me while my away message last night decides to magially have me return, so I wake up to a 'talking to himself' conversation that contains him going on and on about how he was prom king and how he almost had anal with this chick and how he made out with random big tittied chicks too. I REALLY don't care about who, how, and when you're gonna score with a chick, Mike, [Yes his name is Mike too] just like I would imagine you not to care what I did either.  The only good thing is that I didnt do too bad this half-markin' period. Other than that I really dont know what the hell I'm supposed to do with minimal, yes, but annoying all the same, problems that are piling up on top of these. I have no idea what I want.

So I'm enjoying my dinner at the seafood mecca Red Lobster and Mom comments on Josh's grooming and that he needs to start shaving (see prior post on my bitching about Josh... but don't they just grow up so fast?) and I tell him he can have my current electric one because it no longer works for me that well and I want a traditional manual blade and 'shaving product' method. Closer shave that way, you know; plus there is some exfoliation something involved... I just pick this up from your friendly hunky-grooming-guru Kyan Douglas. If you don't know who he is then shame on you. So Mom makes a comment along the lines of 'Really? Has you boyfriend been complaining?'. What!? Is she crazy? Why would she even think I'm dating someone? I've told her I'm not before when she brings this up. I don't leave the house hardly ever now that school's out, and certainly not on Fridays or Saturdays. I don't get phone calls from people and go to my room and talk to them for long periods of time. Plus, she's so on a need-to-know basis. She doesn't tell me who she's dating (if anyone) right off the bat, so why should I. Sure I'm her kid and under 18, but she could be a little less controlling about my personal life. There's a bad story about that I'd rather not get into right now, or possibly never on this blog... feel free to talk with me if you're dying to know. Not to say I don't  want  a boyfriend.. God knows I do, to the point that I get all mopey when I perseverate on it. Hence my signing up for Gay.com in the slight chance some cute boys are on there that feel like talking to me or I actually get the balls to talk to. In any even it was one of those out-of-the-blue and random things my Mom does. Love her for it most of the time (she broke out into singing Barbara earlier), but some times its way to random and just makes me realize how sad I  am  can be.             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3236721,Science,"           This Story is from MSNBC.msn.com    The Ultimate Computer   Earlier this week I wrote about the ongoing addition of feature after feature to cell phones-most recently, satellite TV. I suggested we're at the start of a dramatic period of rapid technical evolution, wherein our information and communications devices are going to morph into all kinds of new combinations. One reader commented:   Name: Joe Hometown: Fort Worth When you continue to add all these features to different sorts of devices, I can see everyone in the not-so-distant future carrying their 'life' with them in the form of some electronic piece of equipment. Just another thing people will be slaves to.  Exactly right, Joe -- although, I think it's up to us as to whether we're the slaves of these devices, or vice versa.  However, besides cramming next-generation computing and communication into a single personal device, there's another element we need: massive information storage, so we can archive everything we do in life, from e-mail to photos to videos, and have it all available at our fingertips. And that's exactly the direction that Google's one-gigabyte, highly-searchable GMail could take us.  About ten years ago I asked Steve Jobs for his vision of the ultimate computer -- the machine that might be possible midway through the 21st century. He said it would be a flat, tablet-like device that you might get as a child; you'd unwrap it, and, via speech and voice recognition, it would ask your name, where it was and then begin learning everything about you.  You'd carry it everywhere: do your homework on it, store all your books and correspondence, and it would subtly integrate itself into your life. It would ask, for example, where you were going and you'd say, 'To my tennis lesson,' and it would respond 'Would you like me to remind you about your tennis lesson at this time every week?' And then finally, Jobs said, you'd be 17 or 18 years old, sitting on your bed talking to your computer, and you'd mention that you'd just broken up with your girlfriend. And the computer would say, 'Steve, it's the third time it's happened that way. You want to talk about it?'  Perhaps that will always be science fiction. But this decade we're seeing the elements of that vision start to come together. Our computers still need to get much smarter, of course, but the ingredients of constant connectivity, massive memory and friendly interface design are on finally on the way, and it's going to be an interesting ride for the next few decades.

3226138,indUnk,"             Peone  urlLink    ...is a common name for any of a family of plants having large showy flowers composed of five leafy sepals, five to ten petals, numerous stamens, and two to five carpels, each with numerous round, black, shiny seeds. The leaves are compound, the leaflets variously and irregularly divided. The fibers of the root are often thickened and tuberous. Peony species are large herbaceous perennials or, rarely, half-shrubby plants, native to Europe, Asia, and the northwestern United States. Because of the beauty of their flowers, some species are cultivated, particularly the common peony, a native of the mountain woods of southern Europe. This species has carmine or blood-red flowers. A variety with double flowers is common. The white peony is another favorite garden species. The mountain peony in favorable circumstances may attain large size and a height of about 4 m (about 12 ft). It is propagated by cuttings and also by grafting.  Scientific classification: Peonies make up the family Paeoniaceae. The common peony is classified as Paeonia officinalis, the white peony as Paeonia lactiflora, and the mountain peony as Paeonia moutan.

3221516,Communications-Media,"                 At 9:00 tonight, my parents will drop Samantha off at O'Hare airport so that she can make the big trip to Africa with SJC Habitat For Humanity members. Everyone's a little nervous to see her go, but I admire her so much for going to a place outside of her comfort zone in order to experience something new.  Meanwhile, as Ryan prepares for college life at Columbia and Saint Joe welcomes another freshman class, I can't help but remember what that time was like for me. The memories are fuzzy, not because I can't recall them, but because it feels like they happened to somebody else, not me. I think about my first roommate and clinging to her as we traveled from Chicago to a little town whose name I couldn't even pronounce. I hated the bugs, the lack of public transportation, the absence of a mall. I missed my family and friends. I missed feeling confident in the person I was. Thinking about that makes it even funnier to me that, almost seven years later, I'm still here.  While I certainly wasn't a wild child, there were definitely a few crazy times that I like to think about and laugh about; getting drunk for the first time; receiving out-of-town visitors at 3:00 in the morning; going to parties, throwing up, and then partying some more. Staying up late to play cards and eat Little Debbie snack packs, the mother of all food groups for broke teenagers. I can't say I had a bad time.  Some people say they don't believe in having regrets; because we have free will, we should embrace each choice we've made because it's our own. I don't think that's true. Having free will doesn't mean having full understanding of ourselves and our actions, and I sometimes wish I had branched out a little more in college--made a bigger effort to know more people, go out on a limb, try new things. As I see Ryan saving up money for dorm furniture and picking out her fall classes, it's hitting me harder than ever that I can never go back to that place again. I will never be 18 years old again. Never again will my life revolve around school. Gone are the days where 20 bucks could last me two weeks because all I needed was money for Grandma's pie. No more waiting for 3 a.m. visitors. I'm just too damn tired.  The upside: I'm glad I can't go back. I was too insecure, too dependent on the people around me, people who couldn't even get their own act together. It's only now that I truly feel confident in who I am and who I've become. But if I could capture those days on video, the good times and the bad, I'd happily watch them all.

Woot! Sarah has a lake house in Canada in Bobcaygeon. Did I spell that right, Sarah? I hope I did. We're leaving Tuesday, July 27 and come back Tuesday, August 3. I am SO excited!   The main reason why we get to go together is that I finished all of my summer reading! WOW! That's the first time I've ever finished all of my summer reading! You guys should really be proud of me. I even finished The Grapes Of Wrath in Europe =). I read about 30 pages a day or more every single day! What good work ethic I have when I have a reward after... I really liked The Grapes Of Wrath as well as Catch-22. They aren't too boring and both of them have incredible endings. I didn't do too well on my Crucible test, 85, but such is life.  Did you read Sarah's AP scores?! Oh My God, she did soo well! Nothing below a 4! That's incredible! I am in awe at all she does for me and for herself and for us. She's wonderwoman... haha. Congratulations Sarah. I am so honored to be your girlfriend =D!  Next year we will be doing Electra for our fall production and Sunday In The Park With George for our spring production. I am really excited about both of them! If you have even the SLIGHTEST desire to audition for either of them, do it! Its really a good experience to overcome stage fright and all of that good stuff. If you have any questions about either of the shows or should you audition and stuff like that, you can ask me. I'm not too scary.  Oh, I am also the Thespian Society president! Yay to me! haha. We will have a meeting at the beginning of the school year to talk about why we aren't doing Sweeney Todd and what Sunday In The Park With George is about. I think everyone will love it! I'll post more details about that later.   Sarah is going to be leaving soon... =(. That's going to be really hard. I don't even want to think about it yet. It isn't the end of the world though! I'll see her every three months, have email, write letters, talk on the phone. We can do it! I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.  WE  rock! (Sarah and I)  *kisses* to Sarah!

3208138,indUnk,"           In stage 3 in the Tour de France, the riders had to go over cobblestones that are usually saved for the spring classics Paris-Roubaix and Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders).

I checked it out, because I had heard some neat things about her. She is really remarkable. The thing I liked the best, I suppose, is that she was a minister’s daughter. Obviously I like that because I can really relate to it, being a pastor’s kid myself. I also like the fact that she has many interests and is talented at many things. I didn’t know she played the piano so well. She even preformed once with Yo-Yo Ma! Her name comes from the Italian musical phrase  con dolcezza , which means “to perform with sweetness”.

3176541,Transportation,"           Der Chor is a choir concept.  Within one congregation (especially Triadelphia) we don't have enough experienced, talented, dedicated singers to maintain a church choir.  This may be true in other churches as well.  The idea is to pull together singers from all the local congregations, potentially even from other denominations.  Der Chor would run one or two rehearsals at each church during the week or two previous to singing there, giving the local church members a chance to join up and sing with a 'big choir' in their own church.  Der Chor would provide the core people, skills and knowledge of the repertoire.  I like the name because it's a play on the homonyms  core  and  Chor  (German for Choir).

317450,indUnk,"       I got to see KatieKerns yesterday. A few minutes more than an hour is not enough time to catch up with one of my favorite people in the world. Catch up might not be the right words. We email and talk on the phone, but this was the first time I've seen her since September. She and I grew up living next door to each other, and used to know exactly how many steps it was from her house to mine. We spent a lot of time wishing we'd grow up, so we could drive instead of ride our bikes. Her quiet house was an escape from my family's hectic household. We liked to go to Dairy Queen in the convertible. She's the reason I like country music and have tendencies to like to shop. Her parents moved from Mockingbird Valley subdivision to Pennslyvania after Katie graduated from high school, when I was already at Murray State. It made seeing her more difficult, but she went to college at UK, so at least were in the same state. We didn't do a good job of keeping in touch in college, but whenever we talked it was like we were sitting on one of our front porches in the neighborhood again, probably drinking Dr Pepper and eating Circus Peanuts or Hometown Pizza. She was in my wedding, I was in hers. The best was last year when Greg and I lived in Lexington, she and Brad did too. They live in Boston now, but I'm working my persuasive powers to talk them into moving to Nashville, where Brad is considering going to school. Plus, they are both into music, and there are so many musical opportunities there. And they'd be closer to me. But not just me. They'd be closer to his family in Tennessee and her family in Owensboro and Lexington. I mean, anything is closer compared to Boston. She brought me a sea shell from Boston, from some unknown cape, on a pretty pink ribbon for my birthday. Katie and I used to talk about how much we hated pink, but we both have since come to terms with loving it. She wrote me a sweet birthday card that made me want to cry. But that's OK because when I hugged her yesterday at Applebee's, she got teary-eyed. I used to have this idealistic thought that my friends today would be the friends for the rest of my life. Cara, Kelly and I used to talk about being fake aunts to each other kids and all going on parent vacations... I love Cara and Kelly for their influence in my life, but I don't know about being friends forever in the childish sense of the phrase.

Would I be doing a disservice to my many 'fond' memories if I didn't? Could the disrepect demonstrated by not going be considered an act of treason against Rocky Mountain House? Well, if it was an issue of that, then Fuck No; I'd be staying home. Besides, Bozzys is merely in the midst of a change in ownership. It'll be re-opened as The Fish Bowl at a later date. No, the issue at hand is a lot different than civic pride or a lack therof. Tonight will be a big occasion. A big occasion means lots of people. Lots of people means lots of girls. That's good! But lots of people also means lots of guys, and lots of guys means lots of bullshit. That's bad. What it boils down to is a case of eye candy versus rampant cases of testosterone poisoning. It's a very complicated decision, as you can see.  And lest you think I'm some sex-crazed buffoon whose whole-hearted belief in the Law of Averages will lead him to harass every person within fifty feet that has a vagina, perhaps I should explain myself better.

3150644,Student,"       Yesterday was speech day. After more than a  month of ardous training, the day finally came. Rahul even thought at first that our speech day GOH drill itself was a rehearsal. That is how hard it is to tell the difference.  I'm quite sad. The two people in my line are Jordan and Weiting, who for some reason keeps on getting screamed at by Herman.  Here's what happened on Saturday:   Morning -  had bible quiz training b4 the drill.  L8 morning -  drill practice, drill practice, drill practice.  Lunch -  Leonard predicted that it could have been komala (is that how you spell it?) but instead it was  pieces of meat and vegetable in between two pieces of bread in a styrofoam box  in which the general idea of the compliments can be summarised into the word 'rotten'.  Afternoon -  THE TIME HAS COME. we thus showed our superior drill to the inferior mortals of the other uniform groups.

So that was it. *.*   Coming up:   Top Ten Tips  to remember for smart drill (i.e. BB drill)  01.Make sure your uniform is straight, starched, and the right colour. 02.Polish those boots. Fire and water methods, and definitely not instant shine. 03.Belt - a little brasso is enough. Rubbing is the key.  04.Make sure all badges are present, all in the right position, and not crooked (nametag too) 05.A hollow boot makes the most noise.  06.Straighten your elbow. (Herman used a method - hold two blue cups while marching. Argh) 07.Lock your arms. 08.Make sure that when you raise your leg, it is at 90 degrees. 09. Always 'stand straight, chins up, chest out', have a sharp jerk of head when taking dressing, sharp turning during whatever  pu-sing , etc. 10.Remember to keep in line (Quote:'It is very easy to see how you are not in line from far away!' - Herman)  Extra Special Tip: 11.

3146314,indUnk,"             Here is the long-awaited account of the 2004 birdrace, which my team (Willo' The Wispers) were joint winners of. I know you're simply gagging to read this heart-rending tale of extreme birding endeavour... If you're a member of  urlLink Peterborough Bird Club , then you can read it in the next issue of  Limosa ,  so don't get too excited.  For a list of the species seen by our team, click  urlLink here .   The annual GPOG birdrace is keenly anticipated by the participating teams and regarded as a frivolous activity only for fools by other birdwatchers. The team that sees the largest number of species between 6pm on Saturday and 6pm on Sunday wins. Teams have four members, and three of the four must see (or hear) the bird to be able to count it. With less than perfect weather for the race, life for the teams was going to be tough, and the competition was much closer than usual. But how close? Read on and find out.    The time:  18:00 hours  The place:   urlLink Nene Washes , Cambridgeshire There was bedlam. It was the start of the 2004 GPOG birdrace and someone had just shouted 'Cattle Egret!” Confusion reigned supreme. Who, what, when… where’s it gone? Some observers saw it but many others didn’t. Enough said! For more, it’s best I refer you to the Peterbirder e-mail archives at:  urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/peterbirder   None of our team members - Brian Stone,  urlLink Steve Dudley , Kevin Du Rose and myself - saw the bird, but we decided we couldn’t hang around all night - we had other birds to chase and after all, under birdrace rules, a Cattle Egret is only worth the same as a  urlLink Chiffchaff … Before leaving the washes, we mopped up all the usuals, plus bonus birds such as  urlLink Pochard ,  urlLink Dunlin ,  urlLink Wigeon  and  urlLink Garganey .  On the drive round to  urlLink Eldernell , we added stuff like  urlLink Collared Dove  and  urlLink Blackbird , arriving at 19:06 and ticking off  urlLink Red-legged Partridge ,  urlLink Stock Dove  and  urlLink Pheasant . A  urlLink Lesser Whitethroat  sang from the hedge on the walk to Lord’s Holt, as did  urlLink Blackcap ,  urlLink Willow Warbler  and  urlLink Wren . From the barrier bank, a drake  urlLink Pintail  was visible on the flood - something we didn’t get anywhere else. Our last bird at Eldernell was a pair of  urlLink Ruddy Ducks  picked up by Kevin on the pit (20:25) - top spotting!  By 20:57 we were near  urlLink Woodwalton Fen , where we got our only  urlLink Little Owl  of the race. The hour from 21:02 to 22:02 saw us add  urlLink Woodcock ,  urlLink Nightingale ,  urlLink Tawny Owl  and  urlLink Grasshopper Warbler . Would we have got extra points if that  urlLink Long-eared Owl  had actually perched on Kevin’s head, instead of veering away at the last moment? A tip-off from the non-GPOG Cambs Diehards meant we hung around at the entrance - they'd just heard a  urlLink Quail  there, distantly. The 501s were also there, and we presumed they were doing the same thing, but as it turned out, they weren't! None of the GPOG teams got  urlLink Quail  in the end.  A return visit in the dark to the Nene Washes yielded nothing more than  urlLink Oystercatcher  and  urlLink Water Rail  (22:54), unfortunately, so it was back to Steve’s for a curry!  Total so far: 64 species.   Next morning...   A later-than-anticipated start saw us cross  urlLink Magpie  off the wanted list at 05:17, and it was off to the Nene Washes again, where we got lucky and heard a  urlLink Whimbrel  at 05:41. Next stop:  urlLink Black Bush Drove , for  urlLink Corn Bunting ,  urlLink Pied Wagtail ,  urlLink Yellowhammer ,  urlLink Wheatear  (06:16),  urlLink Linnet  and  urlLink Grey Partridge  (three pairs, where on several pre-race recces we’d seen none!).  From there, it was a short hop back to  urlLink Farcet Fen  for the resident  urlLink Tree Sparrows , plus  urlLink Greenfinch ,  urlLink Song Thrush  and  urlLink Swallow , and we headed east to  urlLink March Farmers  where we hoped for waders, but only got  urlLink Blue Tit  (07:01). C’est la vie… The drive along the North Bank gave us  urlLink Common Tern  and  urlLink Great Crested Grebe , with  urlLink Little Grebe  and  urlLink Feral Pigeon  added at  urlLink Dogsthorpe Star Pit  (08:17).   It was a real stroke of luck to bump into Tony Parker on his local patch in the Car Dyke/Newborough/Peakirk area. He put us onto  urlLink Kingfisher , as well as a smart  urlLink Whinchat  on Drain Road (08:30) - nobody else got that!   A quick tour of  urlLink Ferry Meadows  netted  urlLink Chiffchaff ,  urlLink Garden Warbler ,  urlLink Goldcrest  and  urlLink House Martin , plus  urlLink Arctic Tern  (09:24). A lucky visit to  urlLink Grimeshaw Wood , Bretton (10:01) brought  urlLink Spotted Flycatcher . ‘Bet nobody else will get that', we thought, smugly. Wrong - all teams saw  urlLink Spot Fly . Oh well.  A drive-by  urlLink Ringed Plover  at  urlLink Hampton  was the 97th bird on the list, before we drove west to  urlLink Morborne Hill  for  urlLink Red Kite  (11:30), then  urlLink Grey Wagtail  at  urlLink Elton , and  urlLink Old Sulehay , where we saw  urlLink Buzzard ,  urlLink Common Sandpiper ,  urlLink Sand Martin ,  urlLink Bullfinch ,  urlLink Coal Tit ,  urlLink Treecreeper  and  urlLink Marsh Tit  (12:29), but still no  urlLink Nuthatch !  From then on, it was a fairly slow afternoon with  urlLink Jay  and  urlLink Sparrowhawk  at  urlLink Castor Hanglands  (13:32),  urlLink Little Ringed Plover  at  urlLink Maxey GP  (15:05), then  urlLink Red-crested Pochard  (16:27) and  urlLink Turtle Dove  (16:57) at  urlLink Baston & Langtoft GP  and  urlLink Deeping Fen  respectively.  We finished up on 111 species, which meant we (Willo’ The Wispers) drew with Just A Hobby (Trevor and Jane Williams and Eunice and Neil Parker). If we’d only got  urlLink Quail ,  urlLink Barn Owl ,  urlLink Hobby ,  urlLink Nuthatch ,  urlLink Short-eared Owl ,  urlLink Mandarin  or  urlLink Lesser Spotted Woodpecker , it could have been so different!  THE END   Went to  urlLink March Farmers  last night, on the lookout for waders. It looks splendid and wasn't entirely unsuccessful, unlike our visit there at the weekend, when we only ticked  urlLink Blue Tit . Yesterday, there was a smashing summer-plumaged male  urlLink Bar-tailed Godwit  (a scarce passage migrant in this area, though there's been an influx over recent weeks), two  urlLink Dunlin , a  urlLink Greenshank , lots of  urlLink Redshank  (as usual) and a herd of inquisitive bullocks.

3144233,Technology,"        Half way has come quite fast and in fact passed us now. Our remaining three months of time in which to complete the desired work looks to be interrupted by strikes, training, school holidays and such, which is causing us all to feel a real time pressure.  And as the pressure mounts, we becomre clearer in our objectives, more settled in our daily lives and more thoughtful of life after the Terai. I personally am looking at a short period of volunteer work elsewhere in more northern nepal, where i can experience the other dimension to national life and also give my sel acothe world from which to apply fo a job.   Our work here and now is going well. We are currently establishing ourselves in the school, endearing ourselves to teachers and students, learning to teach english and manage big groups of children in activities and becoming accustome to rising at 0530. After school we have time off inside away from the heat, and from four to seven do community work and planning. The general objectives are to establish some community infrastructure from which significant members can work together to source development change from local NGOs, in the form of traing advice and funding on health, education and aricutural issues. The girls of our team are currently trying to strengthen the weak aammaa's groups around the area. Like the Indian system this involves Social workers and mothers tring to implement basic change amongst the families through the mothers. Currently this is disfuncntional where we are but potentially a great agent for change. Santos and I are looking at trying to improve the sustainability og forest management along canalsides and pondbanks, in the interest of natural resource maintenance and reliable firewood supply for the poor families.   As is the season we are constanly being dragged off into the night to celebrate the wedding ceremony of some pubescents we don't know. Because we are white and so celebrities being seen at weddings is of prestige to the family concerned, and of course everyone is very friendly. Weddings are a curious event and of course are a mix of Indian and Nepali traditions. It involves sitting around waiting to be fed whilst watching young men hurriedly assembling scary framework from which to hang brightly coloured banners. (Things are always late here)   Food when it does come is usually quite good but I am often keen to leave soon after as the only other entertainment is rather diabolical. After the young couple have driven past in a car a procession will follow. This means a band of brass drums, all banging and smashing with no kind of plan, topped by the distorted reverberating sound of a man singing and playing an organ effect on a touch insensitive keyboard. This characteristic cacophony can be heard all over from as early as 0530 at this time of year and is quite dreadful. If I sound terribly parochial, please understand that I do in fact love Hindi music and have recentley discovered Ravi shankar on the Sitar. But back to the procession. Following the man, with his microphone and his maraude you will just about see through the crowd of fascinated on lookers a young nepali boy dressed as a woman, being circled by a handful of bold or inebriated men barely controlling their frustrated impulses.   Speaking of circling we saw a dead buffallo with its organs exposed through its chewed up ribcages smelling like (a dead buffallo)  and about a hundred huge vultures each with a wing span of at least two metres. However when ever we tried to get close to a vulture it squawks and flees scaring the flock away. Cowardly beasts.   Hope this wasnt too boring :)   bye   From Joel's Nepali Adventures.

3143116,Education,"       Paula is correct.  Contract time in the Catholic Church is frustrating, irritating, and generally a waste of time.  It has been suggested that I disband my children's choir so that I have more time to 'sing and play.'  HELLO!!  These children are the future of the church and that parish!  Why would you want to alienate them and their parents?  The bigger sticking point is time off-- I am expected to basically be on retainer 365 days a year.  I am expected to plan and execute all liturgies, holy days, major holidays, and any other events that may pop up during the year.  For my hard work, I get a whole three Sundays off!!  Isn't that just grand???  I have a meeting with the pastor and business manager tomorrow afternoon.  I can hardle wait!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3143116,Education,"        Political Fallout is Fun    So the good news- the school board of my district voted last night to renew my contract for another year! I'm glad they did that now because my Choral Concert on May 19th would make them reconsider!   And the better news- it looks like the ball-less wonder that runs my school WON'T be getting a contract renewal for next year! I daydreamed all day long about what it would be like to have a competent principal in my building.   In other news, the Spruce Street Singers concert is going to be a crapshoot. Some songs are ready to go, others blow badly. I have decided that I am not going to play for them next year. Although it has been a wonderful professional experience, I really don't need the added headaches and stress this job entails. I'm sure that I could find something else constructive to do on Tuesday evenings next year.   Finally, I really hate the weddings of people I don't know. Brides are stupid- pure and simple. Soloists have the lowest IQ of any life form in the galaxy (except for Elaine, who knows what the hell she is doing). Being a musical prostitute is very tiring sometimes.

I thought about writing in my other Journal, but I miss this one. So for some odd reason, I feel that if I dont update here too then I am a very bad person. Anyhow, Ashley, Amber, and Sam are over at my house. They stayed the night lastnight. Who knows if they had fun or not or anything, but I hope that they did.

3113729,Communications-Media,"                    Felt like seeing a movie for some laughs last week, so four of us went out and saw  urlLink  Anchorman   together.   It was pretty funny - good compared to most of the other big screen former-S.N.L.-castmember trash that's come out before. Will Ferrell does his usual thing here, so if you don't like his brand of humor, this probably won't do anything to change your mind about that. Fortunately, Ferrell happens to have my number. So I got several good laughs out of it. But it's been a little over a week since seeing it and, other than the newsteam turf war and the scene on the bridge to Coronado Island, I've already relegated all other memories of this movie to the basement of my brain. Hence, I am unable to give you a proper synopsis of the movie.  If anybody was expecting this to be worth the price of admission, you're kidding yourself and you know it. I knew this going into  Anchorman , but just decided to play one of my 'what the hell' cards at the ticket window. With that sort of attitude, you won't feel like the movie was a waste. But if you're a tightwad, I'd recommend you save yourself fifteen dollars by waiting until it comes out on DVD and renting it one night when you're in the mood for some dumb humor.

3112128,Student,"        Death and/or Taxes   Death and/or taxes’, that’s the latest craze according to à la mode tax accountant Frank Walsh. “The post-modern era of erratic movements and elegant hand waving has been succeeded by the pre-post-post-modern fad of death and/or taxes”, Frank told a man purchasing a tyre from K-mart yesterday evening, “it’s all the rage in this neo-platonic society of the future, for one to ‘drop dead and cough up’, or merely do one of the previous without having to perform the other action”. Frank, who spotted the rising trend in the summer of 1994, informed the woman standing next to the man buying the tyre that she ought to purchase herself “a casket or a tax book”, in preparing for what he calls, “the Die and/or Can’t afford to buy” revolution.  Walsh is not the only high profile taxation officer predicting this somewhat dramatic shift in the preferred metaphysical basis of populism. Bob Lough and his taxation team at Unemployed Accountants International, have been training a budgerigar from ‘Tim’s Pets and Pet Accessories’, to formulate an algorithm to predict the popular trends in the main stream senile culture- including lawyers and dentists. This budgerigar has predicted an identical trend to that of Frank Walsh’s, which indicates the truth in this seemingly sensible prediction.  Another side to this new to be fashionable trend, is the methods in which one performs these soon-to-be popular acts. Just how does one die fashionably? To answer this, one must curtail their activities and get themselves along to the trendiest crematorium in town. Here it is found that the stars are all dieing with no grace- hair in a mess, nose closer to one’s ear than to one’s mouth, teeth intertwined and most importantly; drugged up. So, now we know the fashionable death, how about the fashionable tax form?  “For a modish tax return, use an outrageously coloured pen, such as red or green, or even a combination of both”, Frank claimed, “and make sure you write down only that which you can know a priori”. This last statement is where the heated debates are concentrated. Can one really be hip, if they only choose to disclose information that one knows a priori? Was Descartes cool in his time- yes, he was. In fact, after Cartesian Dualism took off amongst secular markets, Descartes was admired as a pop-culture icon. On the other hand, when we look at those who tended towards empiricism such as Locke and Hume, we find a boring group, bumbling and unpopular in the eye of the fashionable crowd. It’s hip to be analytic.  The trend of the future; we can know today. Let the trend be your friend- die and/or pay your tax, but do it the fashionable way.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was pretty intense, we kept screwing each other in the ass. Hmm that didn't come out right. Whatever. Anyways Chris won, and Loren was the loser in the end. Buahahaha.   Anyways, I was watching Friends last night. Man that show has gone downhill it's so sad. They should just fucking end it right now already. The whole episode last night didn't really have shit. The only funny thing was the Phoebe can actually do an Estelle really good. And what the fuck was the whole bit with the paper eating guy in th end? Ridiculous. I miss the old Friends episodes. They were so much better. Now I have to resort to stupid reality shows that eventhough I know they're just horrible, I can't have enough of them. I'm such a reality tv whore. Man. And that show The Swan, god. It's just pathetic. I mean all those people supposedly found true 'happiness' after being tucked, cut, sewn, pulled, whatever with shit. It's so weird. I would love to see The Swan 2, a sequel where they visit those women say twenty years from now where the perky boobs are now sagging to their waist, they lipo-ed stomachs and thighs all lumpy and uneven. See that would be somewhat fun to watch. Man am I being mean? Nah. What's even worse is that at the end of each shows when they 'reveal' the contestants (losers) they all started crying and laughing hysterically, saying 'I'm so beautiful,' 'I'm so beautiful.' jeesh. Some of them are still ugly and most of them just look so plastic right now even my ass looks better than their faces. At least my ass is real. Argh, I have to find something to do at work.

The results showed that the volunteers became mentally and physically impaired, their memory suffered considerably, and apart from a few who reported hallucinations, none claimed to'  just a wee excerpt. lord knows where the rest of the article goes there at the end..it dies off i guess :P it just isn't finished n the site.  but what i find amazing is people willingly allowed these experiments to be conducted on them?

3094481,indUnk,"                  Sassy, Single n Satisfied   not being cocky or anything but this really describes me rite now! haha.. i've been listening to pastor's tapes about choosing the right life partner. when i first started, my mum got a bit freaked cos she thought that i was thinking about choosing my life partner alrdy haha. but really somehow i think this 4tape series is the thing teenage girls should be listening to. really! it made me especially happy being single. why? because it's made me set my standard higher on choosing a future partner and knowing that Jesus will provide when the time comes.  i used 2 be the kind of person who had tons of crushes. but never had a bf because i never allowed myself to have one because i insist on giving my future husband the best in me (that blessed man!). but being the romantic that i am. crushes came about naturally. i especially like guys who are suave (okok i like john stevens quite geeky but he rocks! yes lydia!.... hmm...) n do nice things for me so it was fast. even recently i've had crushes. but as i continued to grow in the Lord, things started to change. not because i was faithful in doing my QT etc but because He is faithful.  being sassy single and satisfied is coming to the place where Jesus is no. 1. where knowing that He loves us is enough. not that i've become anti male! no way! i still wanna get married but i've come to learn that Daddy will provide. no such thing as the perfect choice but there is a very good choice out there. focusing my eyes on guys won't make me anyone. focusing my eyes on Jesus makes me a success. makes me more attractive and all. afterall like what pastor said, 'marriage is not two halves coming together to become one whole but two wholes joining together held by God.'  i juz wanna say that this feeling of being me is lovely and extremely satisfying. it's brought alot of security and just amazing joy. i pray that all of u will come to enjoy this feeling soon.

3094481,indUnk,"                  Man’s disappointment, God’s appointment    The posting results just came out on Saturday. I don’t think everyone was that happy about where they got posted. This year, AC and SA were especially hard to get into and I think maybe NJC as well (it’s all those market spoilers as Shawn calls them who are pple who got 6 points and are going to these schools and making it harder for 13 and 14 pointers to get in. But I have to say well done to these “market spoilers” because I’m sure you guys worked really hard to get where you wanted). I’m going to Singapore Poly, btw, gonna do interior design which was my second choice. Anyway most of my friends didn’t get into their first two to three choices. A pal was really disappointed.   Sometimes what we want to happen doesn’t happen. In fact sometimes, the opposite happens instead. I was just sharing with a friend today. The most important thing to realise that what may be considered the best in the world may not necessarily be the best thing for you. They just bring out whatever’s in your heart. Like a million dollars could bring out the bad side or the good in a person (you don’t need me to tell you what a million dollars could be used for). Sometimes what we want to happen doesn’t match what God has planned for you. Even in the bible, Jesus said in the garden of Gethsemane, “… yet not my will, but yours be done.” (Luke 22:42). To me I believe that though Father and Son are one, their wills were different. Jesus was so stressed that He perspired blood. He even said, “if this cup could be taken away from me.” But He followed God’s will and hung on the tree for us. The result: you and I can be sin-conscious free now. Our sins are forgiven and forgotten and all we have to do is to receive Christ and heaven is our home eternally. Matthew 20 gives a really good example of what goes on between God and us. It’s about a vineyard owner who went out to hire people to work for him. The first batch of men bargained with the vineyard owner and settled on being paid a denarius for a full day’s work. A denarius is a full day’s pay basically. Then the owner went out during the 3rd, 6th, 9th and 11th hour and hired more men telling them he would pay them WHAT EVER IS RIGHT. Firstly, these men agreed to work without even knowing how much they were going to get paid. They went by faith (there isn’t another word to describe it). So the time came where all of them were going to get paid. Let’s just focus on the first and last batch. Realise: the last batch of people who were hired worked for only one hour. They were paid one denarius. So were the first batch of people who worked a full day. Again one denarius is a full day’s pay for one hour’s work! That’s our God. Maybe at times the 11th hr people thought they were going to get paid with bottles of wine or an hour’s wages (which is a pathetic $5/hr for us now haha) but in the end they got a full day’s wages. What we want in life could probably be incomparable to what God wants to give us. He’ll never give us less.   This isn’t the easiest thing to grasp. Even I’m still trying to understand this simple statement and the power it’ll bring. I also had another revelation today as I was taking the bus and pondering on this. There are times where we really get something we really don’t want right? And for the rest of the time while we are in that something, we keep harping and wishing we got what we wanted. What if we just appreciated what we had? We would really be having quality life! It’s just about enjoying what we have to the max. And having a spirit of Excellence in everything we do causes things to turn out better. I mean just think! Gets exciting right? I got excited thinking about it. Oh well haha… yeah… Be blessed               ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3082812,Arts,"       Japan is not very famous for producing wine and a lot of is way too sweet; more like Ribena than Montana. However, this place is wonderful. I had a hangover and wasn't particularly in the mood for drinking but it was my first outing alone with Japanese people who don't speak English and I didn't want to be difficult. We took the guided tour first: it was an exemplary example of Japanese efficiency and I'm sure I would have learnt a lot about making wine if I had been able to understand anything that the delightful guide told us. Instead I watched the TV presentations that featured at various points and looked at the fermentation/ bottling/ labelling machines with due awe. After a slow stroll through their underground ageing vaults, we emerged into the sun and were instructed to drive up to the next stage.  The next stage turned out to be a three-tiered complex overlooking the central valley basin of Yamanashi with Kofu city to the left and Mount Fuji directly ahead in the distance. The top tier had an a la carte restaurant; the middle area had a large courtyard with tables and chairs, a shop that served free glasses of the house wine, and a bakery that produced fresh croissant and pasteries as well as selling cheese, crackers, jam and olives; the lower tier had a series of covered cave type things, under which large groups of people were feasting off yakiniku-style bbqs: prawns, scallops, beef and vegetables. Sound impressive? It should; the place is flawless. I was there with a young married couple and their 3-year-old daughter. My friend had previously prepared lunch for us all and brought it in some lovely bento boxes (compartmentalized lunch boxes), so we ate that on the middle tier with plenty of cheese, crackers and wine to give the experience a little French flavor. I had stayed at their house the previous night and witnessed authentic Japanese domestic life for the first time since I came here a year ago. Their house was very old and had minimal furniture, as is the custom, but they were very able hosts and I had a lovely time. Traditionally the family would all sleep in one big room on futon that are stored in cupboards every day. That night there was a large bed made up of three futon inside the room and a single futon just outside the door, and my friend was even sweet enough to ask me which I would prefer. My only complaint would be that her husband is a relic from the dark ages. We woke before him to take her sister to the train and at that time his wife was wearing an elegant turquoise dress. Later she emerged wearing a short, tight black and white thing that was a little trashy, if not slutty. I asked her why and she said her husband had told her she looked like a grandmother in the previous outfit, and ordered her to change it. And she did!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Romance, love affairs and playful activities with children plus entertaining getaways are tops on your menu now. Indulge your creative side as well. Give free rein to your impulse to paint, draw, sing, carve, write, knit, sew, dance -- whatever. It's very important to let your soul sing! The only dark cloud on your horizon is something confusing or even shady connected to your employment scene and possibly your health. This could be a simple misunderstanding.

3072041,Religion,"           By it's very name it leaves me wondering, 'who is on vacation?' I wish I knew, for the director of our church's VBS (your's truly), preparation for this event is no vacation. The last few days have been rather hectic, and stressful. I know of several occasions where my helpers are grumbling about this and that, and the only one who is talking to me about frustrating people or things is my lovely wife, who by the way has helped me greatly to retain my composure at times when we discuss VBS in our house.   I focused on this thought yesterday, VBS is not about me, or any of the other adults in the drama or teaching classes, it's about teaching children about God, and His faithfulness. Why do we adults, complicate ministry. Some of the grumbling I have heard have been along these lines, 'if it doesn't go my way, I quit.' Where is the Christ-like attitude we are told to have in Phil. 2:5? Making demands is definetly not Christ-like, so stop it! I know that any large event a congregation does increases the liklihood of congregational stress and tension. Not all of this tension we experience in churches is bad. As a matter of fact, tension and conflict can reveal a deeper congregational issue, one that can affect overall congregational help. Boy wouldn't it be nice if people got over themselves, and we started functioning as the church was intended? Could the root of some of our problems be that we don't understand the notion of ekklesia? Aren't the called out ones supposed to be different than the world? The church is a community of sinners touched by the grace of God, in need of His tender touch each day. Shouldn't community be what we are striving for? A place where we stop pretedning to be okay, and allow ourselves to be vulnerable with our brothers and sisters, and more importantly with our Lord?         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3056329,Government,"           Hey guys!  So, I know that I'm a little behind the times with the blog, but I just wanted go back to Pat's thing on the essays and sharing them with each other.  I think it's a really good idea, especially for people in the other classes to share essays about the same books.    Anyways...Pat, I thought that your essay was really good.  It reminded me of how materialistic America has become, and we all get swept up in it.  As much as you think you don't, I'm sure that all of you have.  I mean, we all go to Skyview, and none of us seem to be doing that poorly.  I mean, my parents both of decent jobs, we live in a pretty nice house, and we have enough food and clothes and things.  I just throw myself a pity part sometimes, when I go over to a friend's house who lives in Ashley Heights or has a closet full of nice clothes, or wears a different outfit every day...it makes it really hard to be content with what you have and to not be dissatisfied.  But (I'm gonna be religious here), as long as you lean on God, you should never be dissatisfied with what you have.  And that's something that I struggle with, but that your essay reminded me of.  So, thanks Pat.  I wrote a parody, and it's not too bad.  It follows these few pages in 'Their Eyes Were Watching God,' and it's a really amazing part of the book that I wanted to try to recreate.  It was hard, so I'm not sure how good my parody is.  Read it, see what you think of it!  But I've gotta go.  All of the Junior Project stuff is do tomorrow...I should start.  Bye!  Bethany          Mary looked up at her with hungry eyes, only wanting to listen to the unfolding story of her Mom’s life. Sarah looked around as her eyes slowly took in the summer surroundings.  Bees swimming drunkenly from flower to flower, the sun slowly dipping into the Puget Sound, and the gentle crash of waves on the shore.  She smiled and gazed down at her patient daughter.  Mary’s unanticipated interest in Sarah’s teenage years inspired her to tell her story.      She thought of where to begin, and her eyes glanced heavenwards.  The afternoon sunlight danced through the branches of the weeping willow tree and made playful shadows oh Mary’s excited face.  Sarah sighed with content, and decided to begin at the time when she first imagined that maybe she wasn’t a little girl anymore- that maybe she was growing into something greater.  She decided to tell Mary about the time she swam in the ocean at midnight.      It was a warm, summer evening on Whidbey Island.  Sarah had spent the evening roasting s’mores over a beach fire and singing songs with her family.  Every evening of that weeklong vacation, she had been on the beach.  She spent every moment walking along the shore, but at night liked to listen to the waves crash on the rocks, slowly churning beach glass and barnacles into sand.  The ocean called to her, like a mystery that needed to be unearthed.  Not in the way that the ocean calls to a sailor, but she was mesmerized by the intense drifting current and the white foam that disappeared after only moments on the rocky shore.  It inspired her.  How?  Why?  It was like a beat lost long ago, in another time, drifting across the ocean to meet her.  What?  How?  Why?  The song of the ocean was not a real song, yet the salt sea air made her drunk to the world.  It followed her through her every move, and it pleasantly haunted her dreams and thoughts.  The ocean sang to her, the waves the symphony and the air its conductor.  It seemed to connect her to a place or time almost unreal; her observations became acute and alive.  Things that she had not noticed suddenly became vivid and momentous.  They were unearthed and filled her mind and conscience.      She took a few steps towards the water, admiring the sparkling rocks and glistening water.  Although her father’s guitar was now safely inside the cabin, the song still swayed in her mind, a friend in the warm night.  Suddenly the guitar, waves, and air were all playing together in harmony; a melody so strong and inspiring yet so soft and beckoning that she could hardly contain herself.  She fell against the soft sand and stared at the stars, twinkling happily in the dark sky.  Why had she never noticed them before?  The song of the ocean controlled her; she closed her eyes and seemed to float closer and closer towards heaven and the stars.  Did the waves always make music?  Did the moon always make the water sparkle like diamonds?  Yes, but not for her.  Tonight was her night.  She felt limp and drunk with flying towards heaven and listening to earth’s song.     After awhile she stood up and looked across the Sound.  She was seeking some sort of confirmation of her vision, her dream, her revelation.  She received her answer.  The water nodded its agreement, the waves roared its truth, and the stars shone in affirmation. The waves rushed over her bare feet, a usually chilling sensation that now left her smiling with indescribable warmth.  She waded into the water.  About to dive in, she glanced back at the cabin where here parents and siblings were sleeping.  She turned around and dove into the cold water.  She was seventeen!  She was a dancing star and a singing wave, turning over and over in the ocean.  Was the sky so joyful for her?  Nothing answered.  She searched the heavens, floating across the waves in the water.  Looking, waiting, breathing short with impatience.  She stood and looked around her; the world was made in a new light.

I don't remember much about them because I was so young. I remember the latter because I went with my mom to wake her up that morning but she was already gone. It was a disturbing site that I still remember today. And I remember her funeral somewhat. Though I wonder at times what my life would have been like with them in it, that's all I can really reflect on. I don't have long lasting memories with them; nor do I know what I've missed out on without them.   I also lost my grandmother due to emphazema. She was a good woman. She wasn't spiritual my any means so I didn't have her to strengthen that part of my life. But, she played a mean game of cards, which I always enjoyed. I remember being somewhere around six or seven years old and she would lay on the bed as I would scratch her back; she really liked that. After about ten minutes I would fall asleep and when I would wake up later she would give me a quarter. I thought I was rich; my grandma had made me rich! ;)  Fortunately for me, my parents are still alive and the rest of my brothers and sisters. I haven't lost any best friends or even close friends. I know what deep loneliness feels like so I can imagine what it must feel like when such things do happen.   I am fortunate. But many are not. For those who lost their friends and family members during 911, or during the IRAQ war, or any war, or any other way, all I can say, is remember everything good about them that you can. Cherish their memories, talk about them if possible, and before you die, leave a legacy for them behind you, and someone may do the same for you.  For those of you in our writing group, I leave a memorial today for you, before it's late to hear for yourself...   To Sis Cook:  You are a wonderful woman, who has shown so much faith during your trials that if I had a mountain close to yours I'm sure it would have moved as well. I admire your spirit in the midst of trouble. I admire your zeal to encourage others (like the woman at the courthouse) while you are in need yourself. You are always full of hope and that gives others hope. You are great woman of God.   To Angela:  There is probably not a better child that your mother could have ever had than you. Angela, you are a pillar of strength for your mother. When other young people would have withdrew inside, or acted out their trials in sin, you stayed strong, and you stayed by your mother's side the whole time. Your presence alone to her, I'm sure, was worth more than any words you could have ever told her. You always make me feel special when I hear you call... 'Sis. Clabaugh...' You make me smile. I can only imagine how the rest of your life will touch others.   To Sis Sneed:  Girl, you are great! You have so much wealth built up inside you that I am rich just knowing you. You have raised wonderful children that love the Lord and you are the strength in your home. I know things have been tough, and it would be easier to walk away... but look at you... you are still standing! You are awesome.    To Sis Holzberger:  Sister, what a wonderful woman of prayer you are. I always admired your cheerful spirit and the way you smile when you worship, even when life isn't so good to you. I don't know how you do that, I always end up crying! :) You have prayed prayers for others that they wouldn't even pray themselves, and you are always thinking about others more than yourself. I hope you never lose those prayers, or that smile. You've encouraged me many times, and I can't express how thankful I am for the many times you've thanked me for the smallest of things I've done. We need more people like you.    Sis Cindy:  I know you don't like public gushiness (if there is such a word,) but I am so glad that you have come to our church and became a part of my life. I enjoy every minute around you, and I can see why so people have said they like you. You have such an admirable spirit. You never degrade anyone, or belittle them, or talk bad about them... you are just you, and I always feel good being around you. Your talent in writing is awesome, and I hope you continue to let it come out. Your testimony is tremendous. Our lives share many common things so I know how you feel about some things without you even telling me. Thank you for being a friend and being yourself.   Sorry for the long post.

Our conversation reminded me that we've all been let down and hurt, but it's up to make sure that we don't - to steal a line from Hallmark - let yesterday use up today.  ____________________________________________________________   A Choice   There are failures  along with the victories. Friends who’ve been true and those who have fallen short Of our vision for them.  There is joy, but sometimes it is hidden or forgotten, behind a rambling wall of deceit and hurt.  We have a choice to make: The pain can hide the joy or increase the preciousness of it.  The failures can be why we quit or the reason we strive harder than ever.  False friends can be why we trust no one or the reason a true friend humbles us with respect and admiration.  It’s where  we allow our minds and hearts  to linger That will ultimately decide.  -Cindy           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3045238,indUnk,"           Herpes virus takes strange paths I am very disappointed in a recent column about getting herpes from a toilet seat. The herpes simplex virus does not live outside the body and needs direct skin-to-skin contact to spread. It is impossible to get it from a toilet seat.  A recent study found that one in four people had genital herpes, but only 12 percent knew they were infected. That means the majority had no clue that they had it and could spread it. Most people attributed their symptoms to some other problem.  Medical wisdom maintains that a clean, dry toilet seat cannot transmit herpes or any other infection to intact skin. But not all toilet seats are clean and dry.  Several readers, like this one, contacted us to insist they contracted infections from gym equipment or unsanitary facilities: 'At my gym there are many men and women who are models with great bodies. Quite a few of these people have herpes from being promiscuous.  'These men shave their legs, arms, underarms, butts and even pubic hair at the gym in the shower. You said intact skin and a dry toilet seat are safe. But you don't have that in many health clubs. Shaving is an abrasive action and often produces bleeding. I have seen guys shave and jump out of the shower and use the toilet. 'I am a power-lifter and do squats with as much weight as possible. Sometimes I shave from my knees to my thighs to tape my thighs before working out. One day I showered and dried off and went to the toilet, but the seat was wet. I took a towel and wiped it, but a few weeks later I had a rash. My doctor diagnosed it as herpes and prescribed Valtrex. The rash was gone in three days.  'I have been married for 25 years to my high-school sweetheart and have never even considered cheating on her. How could I explain this? Luckily my doc asked us a lot of very personal questions and said it was very likely I got it from the gym.'          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3044801,indUnk,"       I don't know who that is - husband tells me a labor leader of some sort - but he was important enough to get a state holiday and close state offices for the day. Husband has been in California since 1997, me since 1998 (except for that span from summer to summer  2002-3), and this was the first we'd ever heard of it. Found out when we went to the DMV to register the car and they were closed. At a guess, state workers go bowling on their day off, because the parking lot at the alley up the street was jammed when we drove past.  And because of state offices being closed, husband was unable to call about unemployment status...  I'm more concerned about that as a matter of survival than anything. If I could, I'd walk on the marriage right this second. He's just so ... so ... ARGH! inducing. I'd purchased some frozen dinners because I figured, if I was sleeping come time he got hungry (which I have been lately), he could pop a couple in the microwave and fix himself dinner. But what does he do? '[Silkenglider], it's 8,' which as I've said earlier, is code for, 'Get up and feed me.' I got out of bed, went into the kitchen, and said in as sweet of a tone as I could muster, 'See, what you do is, you open the freezer door, and take out a couple of frozen dinners.' He replies, 'And then?' and I answered in my same sweet one, 'Then... you open them, read the instructions, put them in the microwave, cook 'em, and eat 'em.'  I mean, my god!, he can't even microwave himself a fucking Banquet dinner! Hell - last week I bought a couple of pre-made salads that come with dressing and a fork and did he eat dinner when I didn't get up? NO! He just didn't eat, then came to bed with a semi-whiny, 'It's [whatever] o'clock.'  Well excuse the FUCK out of me for trying to escape my crappy life in the only way I have available at the moment. I'd commit suicide, but ... meh. Whatever. Shit, when I finally get a job, it'll probably be evening hours so that I have transportation, so what the hell is he going to do then? He'll be 49 damn years old on Saturday and he can't even fix a fucking god-damned frozen dinner! Or, more accurately, WON'T.   ARGH!  Ahem.  Sorry.

3043539,Arts,"        Is it so hard to believe our hearts are made to be broken by love  Today at school was pretty good. School took forever to get through though. All we did was review for finals on Wednesday and Thursday. This quarter has been 10x harder than the last two, but oh well, Im still doing alright. Went to Rachel's after school to work on science stuff. We got most of it done and were still able to watch a few movies. Spring break in 2 more days thank god....  I got home like an hour ago or so and everything has kinda been hitting me since like half an hour ago. I hate being a girl, no matter what you're in love with someone or something but you hate that person or thing with such a passion. Its the worst when you hate one of your 'best' guy friends but you love him so much. This friend of mine has been my friend since like the 7th grade, but this year he changed so much. Everyone I know did but he changed probably the most out of all of them. Something happend between me and him but he ended up breaking my heart very soon after stuff started happening. Then he goes back to his ex for like the 2nd time. Now he practically hates me. Today on the ride back to Rachel's (yes we were cool today and took the bus), he sat right behind me and didnt even look at me or say anything to me. I really didnt think anything of it until he walked past me and (ok this is kinda weird) I could smell him. His smell to me is like.....'home' I guess. I miss that smell more than anything. I feel safe when I smell it cause it means that he's around. I hate him so incredibly much but I love him and miss him more than Ive ever missed anyone in my life. These past 2 months or so have probably been the hardest Ive ever had to go through, and not just cause of this stuff with him. Theres much more. But Ive never really had this much drama going on that involves me ever, so being able to handle it all gets really hard at times, plus school and finals. Yet, Im really proud that Ive been alright and Im still smiling when Im around most people through all this stuff. Most of my friends would've given up on everything so long ago if they were me but Ive been making it through all this stuff practically on my own. No one really to talk to much anymore besides a select few people that I know I can count on, but they still dont know everything thats going on. Im not gonna let the world bring me down....yet at least. Im still young and have so much ahead of me and this is just highschool. I havent even really lived yet. But I hope that all this stuff ends soon here. Feeling lonely and unwanted all the time kinda gets old after awhile....  K done bitching, but I can bitch as much as I want. Its my profile ha! But I gotta get going anyway, I have to make myself a cheat sheet thing for science anyway. Later my loves.  Mood: ^read above^ that will tell you how Im feeling... Listening to at the moment: Letters To You- Finch (yes, sadly Im super emo at the moment.....actually Im not but Finch makes me laugh because of emo jokes with Bellamy....I love that guy. He makes me smile more than anyone I know, hes always there when I need him. If I was a guy, I'd probably be him most likely because he's me in guy form and Im him in girl form.

3043495,indUnk,"             Tuesday I picked up Slash and Burn,  urlLink Stephan Smith 's new CD. It's great and includes the song  You Ain't A Cowboy , which I plugged a few months ago. You can listen to songs from the album on his site, and download songs from previous albums. Be sure to check out 'The Bell.' It was the most played anti-war song before the war in Iraq.  I had to special order it at the local CD store. In many ways it's easier to just use Amazon or whatever and it often feels like the extra money you pay for postage is worth the time saved. But I'm going to make an effort to special order books and CD's from local independent stores, because it supports the local economy and builds a sense of community. Also, if enough people special order something they're likely to start carrying it, meaning that more people will be exposed to it.  A couple friends and I saw Stephan play in Davis a few weeks ago (June 4). It was a benefit for the local community radio station  urlLink KDVS . There was a small turnout, which made for a more intimate environment.   It also meant that I got to talk to him a fair amount both before and after the show. I'd met Stephan in person in September 2002 when he played at a protest in Washington, DC, where I was living at the time. We've corresponded periodically via email since summer 2001, and he played a benefit for  urlLink Quest for Peace  last October. I sent him a demo in 2001, but I bought him a short CD with some of my new stuff. He said it was cool because he needed music to listen to in the car when driving to Portland on Sunday. We'd been talking about my job hunt and he said to give him a call on Sunday on his cell phone to talk some more while he was driving. When I called him he was driving through Southern Oregon and said he'd gotten 'Drunken Fratboy' stuck in his head!

I remember now why I usually don't like these types of films. Let me tell you, this ain't no 'Ice Storm'. Although Elijah Wood would have been a much more fitting casting choice than Jake Gyllanhaal. Global Warming strikes and oddly enough it has led to a cooling trend. Quick Americans! Flee South! Get your asses to Mexico! Ice storms are a comin'! The main characters cannot flee, of course. The 'son' (Gylanhaal) needs to stay in Manhattan to first woo his teenage sweetheart and then save her life. The 'dad' (Dennis Quaid) must walk in snow shoes from Washington DC to save him. And the 'mom' (Sela Ward) must stay in a hospital because she is an oncologist and has to read Peter Pan to a young chemotherapy patient (don't ask). Jake and his friends find safety in the New York Public Library and guess how they keep warm? That's right! They burn books! Isn't that a great message? And to complicate things, the wolves escape from the Central Park Zoo and give them a chase.

3029597,indUnk,"   We assume that if 'Honsberger Live!' is indeed live today, Fred will talk about Ronald Reagan.  Of course his death is sad.  He was a human being with friends and family, people who loved him.  Their grief is very real and must be respected.  Alzheimer's is a cruel disease.  It must be an awful way to die and an awful way to watch a loved one die.    That being said, before we travel down the path of 'Ronald Reagan singlehandedly saved us from ourselves' we should like our readers to keep in mind some things:   Iran/Contra Scandal    In a nutshell (for those who don't remember) the Reagan Administration, while publicly proclaiming that it doesn't make deals with terrorists, made a deal with some terrorists.  Through the CIA and intermediaries, they sold weapons to Iran, (at inflated prices) and then diverted the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.  All illegal and all hidden from congressional oversight.  Harbor Mining in Nicaragua    In January of 1984, Reagan secretly approved the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in order to destabilize that country's economy.  His administration never informed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (as was required by law) and even Senator Barry Goldwater called it a violation of internation law, an act of war.  The World Court agreed, and so Ronald Wilson Reagan made us a Rogue Nation.  Economy    If I am reading this  urlLink table  correctly, Reagan inheritied a budget deficit of a little more than $70 billion and then handed George H. W. Bush a defict close to $200 billion.  But before anyone says, 'But it was a Democratic Congress, and THEY pass budgets!' let us remember that the budgets Reagan proposed were very very very close to the budgets congress passed.  According to the Congressional Almanac, budgets totally $7314 billion were proposed in the years 1982-1989 and $7361 billion were passed.  But think about it, wouldn't it be great to have a budget deficit of  only  $200 billion?  What is it now?  More than double that?  But I digress...  As far as Reagan being staunchly against raising taxes, Joshua Green of the Washington Monthly urlLink  points out  that Ronald Reagan raised taxes four times in two years (1982-1984).  One of those (a $100 Billion tax hike over three years) Green calls the 'the largest since World War II.'    When will Grover Norquist denounce these?  When will the republican noise machine start to grind out misinformation about them?  If time permits, we'll look into the Reagan Record on some other topics.  But, remember Reagan was the guy who said on October 20, 1965   'I favor the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and it must be enforced at the point of a bayonet,  if necessary.' Only to say some 8 months later on June 17, 1966:   'I would have voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.'   That, my friends, is a Flip-Flop. ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3025353,Religion,"             I had my semi-annual dental checkup this morning.  Dr. Patel gave my choppers a clean bill of health.  And last night Laura and I watched ' urlLink The Secret Lives of Dentists .'  On the whole, I enjoyed sitting in the dentist's chair more than sitting on my sofa watching that movie.  Campbell Scott (David) and Hope Davis (Dana) play a married couple who practice dentistry together.  They have it all--the business, the three great kids (even the youngest who won't stop hitting people), the house, but of course something's amiss.  David is emotionally cut off from his wife, although he's a loving and fairly competent father.  It starts to become apparent that Dana is having an affair.  Painfully apparent, but David won't confront her, because if he does, then there will be a divorce, right?  At times I wondered if the wife and the toddler who smacked everybody weren't both trying to figure out just how much they'd have to act out before ol' Dr. David noticed.  Meanwhile Denis Leary plays (who else?) a real jerk who gets some dental work done at their practice.  He then morphs into David's alter ego, taking up residence in David's unconscious, urging him to get out of this dreadful marriage.  Sort of like Brad Pitt's character in  urlLink Fight Club , although Fight Club is a  very  different film.  The climax of the movie is a bout of intestinal flu that leaves all five family members throwing up on each other, and resolves once and for all whether the marriage will survive.

'We need a shuttle to build a space station,' they said.  And why to we need a space station?  'To give the shuttle something to do.'  Beautiful.  The Columbia disaster has forced the government to get off the Merry Go Round.  To the extent that the President is getting NASA out of the shuttle/space station self-perpetuation business, he deserves credit.  But remember who'd be in charge of this project:  the same people who said that they could build a space station for $8 billion.  We're going on $40 billion, I think, and what do we have to show for it?  And how many NASA people have lost their jobs after the Columbia inquiry torched the agency's culture of silence?  Not a one, as far as I know, but click on the comment link if I need correcting.  Heads need to roll in this profligate, cavalier federal agency.  The new administrators need to be men and women who know space and know how to change the culture of a bureaucracy.  Then we can ask about the goals and objectives of manned space travel.

3025353,Religion,"             I grew up in Fayetteville, North Carolina, best known for its close proximity to Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd Airborne Division.  Units of the 82nd are seeing a lot of action in Iraq.  They are occupying portions of the so-called Sunni Triangle, a hotbed of anti-American guerrilla activity.  Author Thomas Wolfe, born at the other end of North Carolina, wrote a book titled  You Can't Go Home Again .  That's been my unofficial motto for thinking about my hometown.  I'd long since concluded that my peculiar views on Christian nonviolence would make me unemployable anywhere near the Fayetteville city limits.  But my new  urlLink Christian Century  arrived in the mail today, and I was put to shame.  A little article in their news section detailed the work of Fayetteville's  urlLink Quaker House  .  These pacifist Christians are making an effective witness for peace in one of the more thoroughly militarized regions of the country.  Quaker House affiliates regularly protested against the Iraq War.  At present they assist soldiers who are leaving the army on conscientious objector grounds.  They also offer a listening ear to family and friends who are scared to death about the plight of relatives who've been deployed to Iraq.  It was rough going in March, according to the  Christian Century  article, but as the occupation has soured, Quaker House workers are finding that community support of their mission is rising.  Maybe I can't go home again, but that doesn't mean that the gospel isn't being proclaimed in Fayetteville, NC.  Thank God it doesn't depend on cowardly little me!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3025353,Religion,"             Let me say first of all, I'll vote for anyone to be president other than George Bush.  Since Kerry has the best shot of beating Bush, he's certainly got my vote in November.  But  urlLink this story  really bothered me.  Using Scripture as a political campaign attack weapon - there's just something not right about that.  There's plenty of sin in the Democrats and the Republicans, so we don't need any self-righteous finger-pointing.  Please, Kerry, don't use Scripture in this way again.  Now if Mother Teresa had wanted to use Scripture to criticize Bush, that would have been fine.  Even Jimmy Carter has the moral authority to do that.  But Kerry doesn't.  It just doesn't fit.  Other problems with this story: Kerry SHOULD let the Pope tell him what to do.  Kerry perpetuates the private/public split about which I have written before.  Of course, Bush also perpetuates the unfortunate split, and he should allow his Methodist bishops to tell him what to do.

Unoccupied, & blazing with such ferocity that the driver & I sat silent for a long time after we passed the scene. Hoping no one had been hurt, it was a forceful reminder of the fragility of not just human life, but of those objects in which we instill our trust. We put our children in the backseat. We drive to the hospital with ailing elders strapped into the passenger side. And yet, one day, when you're driving along & everything's fine... and before you can react, something goes wrong. Bang.

3010250,Consulting,"             EPISODE II : In The Limelight    :: SUMMER NIGHTS ::     Timeline:  Past  Since my mother passed away on December 23rd, 1993, New Year Eves still give me a sense of nostalgia somewhat. Not a miserable state of the mind since pain subsides in time. That and human beings do get used to anything and everything. What remains is a minute or so of sad smile accompanied by a distant stare as the sorrowful anniversaries arrive. Then you return to the present with the speed of light and proceed.   The New Year Celebrations of 1994 was the most silent in my entire life. My father and I remained at home, watched TV, nibbled on fast food and just wanted the clock turn towards the new year as soon as possible. Our lives were waiting for us and time, when left alone, passes you by so quickly that when you realize what is going on, a considerable amount of it is left behind.   The educational system of Ponderland is somewhat eerie. If you don't have a University degree you are quite next to nothing (if you don't have many a personal bonuses, that is and High Schools are not adequate enough to educate their students so as to individually credit them for life after primary education without a higher degree) and for that reason the Ministry of Education prepares a nationwide exam for all those who wish to literally 'compete against each other' so as not to... well... starve for the rest of their lives.   However, I needed to finish High School for that first. Going back to school after the Holiday, I completely focused on my studies and got back on track thus graduating with a degree. However, my goals for University were real high (I wanted to study Literature at... what can be defined as the Harvard of Ponderland). Casualty, when it comes to my personal goals, has never been what I went for so I entered the exam, knowing I barely had the chance to end up in the Uni I wanted. At least that year...   ... the exam is usually held in June and right after it, I ended up in our summer house. I truly needed some rest and had to be away from anything and everything after a marathon session of drastic events.   That summer is specifically important since it hosted the first relationship in my life. Our summer house was part of a huge block of summer houses in the outskirts of Ponderland, right by the sea. I had many seasonal friends there which, in time, turned into permanent close friendships. Goddess, as I will call her, was just one of them. On a warm summer night, adorned with a soft summer breeze on the beach, she asked me why I didn't have anyone special in my life. Up until then, love was just an emotion that awakened curiosity in me yet never practiced. I just remained silent and believe me there are not many situations I fall speechless. Although the subject just diminished as we laughed away the night, something inside me was switched on.   There is yet another thing about my personality that if I could alter, I would. However, I also accept and love myself the way I am so I love my 'downs' as much as my 'ups'. I have no intention to be picture perfect anyway. As for this trait, it is going for what seems impossible and making it as possible as it could get. When it comes to love, it is no different. So unconsciously I searched for a target to fall in love with and make him fall in love with me. I never was and still am not into what can be called as 'the scene'. All my friends were straights. So this 'search' was not easy... and to tell you the truth, that was why I loved it.   I don't know why I decided on Gambit. He was just a casual guy (not the Prince Charming at all) and above all, he was very straight. I knew him since I was 13 and all through those summers and recently winters, we literally grew up together. I had never felt anything special about him.   There is also something extraordinary I had to add to this story. And that is something I always possessed. First of all, let me tell you that all through these years of careful observations of the human kind and relationships, I came up with the conclusion that people initially identify each other unconsciously. When you encounter a man, let's say, you first receive the gender specific undergoing, invisible current about him. Scientifically, it is described as an outcome of hormonal secretion which turns into a emission of a transsensual scent and is received by the next party. Hence, he/she regardless of your appearance, first picks you up as a male or female, in that sense. I call it an invisible transmission between sexes. That is how Transgendered or gays can be 'read' by the society, especially by females whose sixth sense are more developed than men.   I realized by then that my undergoing transmission was that of a female which had some really interesting effects on guys... especially straight guys. Since what they received from me was not the transmission of a gay, they always unconsciously approached me as a female without the fear of ending up feeling gay. I was always the one who was protected, respected and next to whom they acted more polite than usual (I wonder if this fact ever dawned upon them though I'll never know). And I used this specialty on occasion to protect myself from the outer world with a shield of male friends. Sometimes, I even used it when it was not necessary at all. Seriously, it was really so fun (if not slightly sadistic) to 'activate' this ability out of nowhere towards a guy and see him end up orbiting around me where everyone else (even himself) considered us friends. Though I never used it to a degree to make him feel utterly confused about himself or approach him sexually. I had very strict limits to keep it as a safe, little game I played, indeed.   Until the 'Gambit Project', that is.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3009982,Student,"        The 4G House   Of all the four houses I lived in, 4G was without a doubt, my favouritest. It was the darling of darlings. It was located right in the middle of the old Johor Bahru town, on a slope. It was a typical old colonial bungalow you find around Malaysia, with the old window designs and that old smell you can never get rid of, not that you’d want to anyway.  The house was owned by the church we attended, Holy Light Presbyterian. And so when my dad joined the pastoral team, we were given an offer to stay to at 4G since it pretty near church. The senior pastor was the former resident and soon after he moved into his own house, we moved into 4G.  It wasn’t a pretty looking house when we first moved in. Sure, it had its old, cozy English look, but the huge rambutan tree was unkempt and the orchids planted around the compound looked horrendous with charcoal around the plant. There were 2 mongrels left behind by the pastor and his missus, Brown and Tiger, both female and extremely lovable. It was quite some months before we got the house up. Dad did some thorough work in the garden and soon he had some vegetable plants at the back, and loads of flowers up in front. The dogs used to dig up the plants and every morning, I would cringe at the sound of Brown howling when dad caned her. Haha, oh gosh, we caned our dogs.  We had a cat named Oscar, which we brought over from our Taman Suria house over to 4G. I doubt Oscar was used to living with two boisterous female dogs, but the dogs sure enjoyed him! When we moved, we drugged Oscar for a few hours, and when he woke up, we decided to let him out of the mobile cat kennel thing. Drowsily, he fumbled out and walked onto the grass, smelling cautiously around. When suddenly two huge brown furry things which smelt real bad came sniffing him, spraying saliva all over. THEY WERE DOGS!!!! Goodness you should have seen Oscar run. Never have I seen a cat run that fast. And he ran up the rambutan tree, not knowing whether they were anymore of these brown furry wet things around. That, I bet was the first time too that Oscar had ran up a tree. Me, being the lover and fusser of Oscar, checking on him every half an hour, and he refused to come down. I remember very clearly, he stayed up in that tree for 8 hours. Nah, we didn’t call the firemen.  That time, when we had moved to 4G, my bro had grown up and wasn’t so keen on playing guns and shooting stray cats with me anymore. He was in form 4 and had begun hanging out with the young adults from church. So I was left to look for companions to share my childhood curiousity with. My two neighbours Nina and Melissa were the ones. Strange though, what we used to do.. You’d never believe it. We used to make pancakes together and figure out weird recipes for our poor parents to try, or if it turned out horrible, we’d take it over to the Istana Gardens nearby and feed it to the ducks in the pond. Hehehehee.. Sigh, memories.. We would often go down to the Malay warung for breakfast too, the pak cik knew us well. His lontong was superb man. ;)  Besides that, we would just play our normal stuff, talk our girlie stuff and go to the old library up the hill every once in a while. They didn’t dare go too often because their photos were pinned up on the ‘Didn’t return library books’ section. Haha, killer times lah.  Back then, my parents let me out by myself more often. Nowadays, and I’m 15+ mind you, and I can’t even cycle round the next street. Sad betul… When my bro was in a happier mood, he’d take me for walks thru the nearby Malay kampung at the back of my house, then we’d go see the cemetery and the guy who carved the tombstones. Before going back, we would of course, buy some kuih kadok (toad kuih) before going back home. Hahaha. Most of the time, my brother would be out cycling by himself. Once, on Easter Day, he fell off his bike on a slope and broke two of his teeth. He breaks a lot of bones, don’t worry.  The house at the top of the hill had been doing renovations and leaving piles of sand by the roadside. So during the rainy season, it would wash the sand down to our road and since it blocked the drains, our whole house would get flooded. We used to curse that house a lot because after the flood cleared, wah, our house compound was one muddy swamp. And it happened quite a few times.  More on 4G later, have to study.

3005033,Communications-Media,"       ...is what I will call anyone who dares to leave ill-conceived comments on my precious blog.  Megan had an anonymous comment left on her blog...apparently, someone does not share the JT love.  I hope everyone knows to play nice.  I only have a couple short items tonight, and then off to bed.  Firstly, links are back! (Polite golf applause)  I figured out, thanks to Megan and Blogger Help, how to add links to a template that does not originally allow for them.  This improves my quality of life 8000 percent.  I am under verbal oath to write this in my blog, even though it is destined to be a 'you had to be there' kind of scenario.  Tonight, I was talking to Matt on the phone (a rare treat this week since his cell phone's been broken), and I was expounding on my newfound love for Gillian Welch.  I mentioned that I was excited to find out she was only my age, not in her thirties as I had previously presupposed.  He responds, amused, that I always become excited when people I admire artistically are my age, and feel the need to mention it.  I suddenly realize this is absolutely true, and comment that he remains the most observant person I have ever met.  No idiosyncracy is too small to slip past his radar.  And he says gleefully, 'You don't understand.  I am  Observo .  I'm an effing  detective .  And the gravity of just how true this is bombards me anew and I say, sort of in an 'oh wow' hushed awe, 'you  ARE ...you ARE Observo.'  I guess something in the dramatic nature of my voice saying something we already fully well knew to be true, added with the implicit hilarity of Observo, was too much for him, because he laughed for like an hour.  And made me promise to put it down for posterity.  So there ya go.  Next: I was planning my trip out in my mind today, and remembered that the last time I was at my sister Kim's, she let me do some laundry in her new machine, and it was the best laundry experience I ever had.  It's very technologically advanced, and makes for a more thoroughly cleaned, and better dried garment.  Keep in mind I've been using over-used pay washers and dryers for most of the last seven years, so it was a little like Disneyworld.  But just a little.  Anycrap, I was thinking about just packing all my dirty clothes and washing them there when I fly into Akron and have lunch with her, but was suddenly stricken with the thought that they check all bags, and mine would be filled with dirty clothes, and wouldn't that be embarrassing if they cracked it open in front of me?  I only realized much much later that they have no way of knowing if I'm coming or going, and EVERYONE has all dirty clothes on the way back.  So they're probably used to a little bit of smelly sock action.  Nothing they can't handle.  Free laundry, here I come.    Anyone in CBus want to go to Red White and Boom Friday?  I have to recruit people for vh1, but then I want to watch the fireworks, and possibly watch a large amount of funnel cake disappear into my mouth.    Lastly: I cannot emphasize enough how sick I am of hearing people say that music sucks right now.  I AM SICK OF IT.  In all likelihood, this is a variation on the 'rock is dead' hyperbole that Randy and I have been dialoguing about, in which case what people are really saying is that there's nothing good on TRL or Z100.  That statement is entirely possible.  But since when are we 14 year-olds who only know how to plug into those two sources to get music?  Top 40 radio and video shows cater to the lowest common denominator of the general public, and none of my friends really fit into that category, thankfully.  Now, that's not to say that an occasional work of greatness can't climb into the Top 40, just don't bank on it all the time, cause you're bound to be disappointed.  The truth is, most people LIKE Hoobastank's 'The Reason,' and New Found Glory, and Hilary Duff, because they've never been exposed to anything else, and some people don't care to be.  Music serves as a distraction for those types and little else.  Not so with us, dear readers.  Most of us eat breathe and poop music.  It is in our pores, in every day of our lives.  It challenges and comforts and changes us, and we probably all agree that even a single artist or song can change your life.  So it's not wrong to say that a lot of music is sub-par right now, but when was that not the case?  Have you never seen VH1 classic?  It's filled with TERRIBLE (but also some great) videos from days of yore. (And by yore, I mean the eighties.)  The point is, the exciting part is that there are MANY great artists making music today, and several emerging scenes of great musicians, image, and community, like alt-country or indie rock or even the resurgence of a more true-punk sounding rock.  Saying that all music sucks right now is like a man lying in his bed starving to death because he's too lazy to go out and find food at the corner store.  We don't even have to go that far!  LimeWire is great, purevolume.com is great, and if you don't know where to start, I'll be glad to help you find music that doesn't suck in any genre. So buck up, brothers and sistahs, I've found at least five new songs that enthralled me just this WEEK.  So get out there and find some soul food.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3001180,Law,"                  urlLink  Stewart  v.  Koppel   pulled from Sufergirl's Blog on  urlLink Slate .    But after the commercial break, something unforeseeable happened on  Nightline: an anchorman showdown! What began as a casual media-on-the-media puff piece turned into a fascinating 5-minute referendum on old and new ways of looking at the meaning and purpose of television news. In a one-on-one chat on the deserted convention floor after the day's festivities had ended, Koppel, in his low-key, dignified, What-Me-Worry way, got medieval on Stewart's ass.  From the start, Koppel made no secret of his distaste for Stewart's show: 'A lot of television viewers -- more, quite frankly, than I am comfortable with -- get their news from […] The Daily Show.' His first challenge to Stewart: 'You say that [the Democratic Convention] is like a product launch.' 'Not like a product launch – it is a product launch,' Stewart replied, and proceeded to outline his take on Kerry's nomination as the result of a year-long process of corporate branding: 'John Kerry: now with lemon!' A pretty standard line of argument for those of Stewart's generation, reconciled as we are to our postmodern condition as the constant targets of marketing and spin, but to Koppel, it must have sounded like the sheerest nihilism. As the interview proceeded, it became clear what a gulf lay between Stewart's and Koppel's views of the world, and it was heartbreaking to watch, like eavesdropping on your cool brother and your nice uncle as they pursue some hopeless ideological argument over Thanksgiving dinner.  'Unexpected things used to happen in the world. They don't happen anymore,' continued Stewart matter-of-factly. Parried an impatient Koppel, 'Oh, sure they do.' Stewart was careful to separate The Daily Show's mandate from that of 'real' television journalism: 'I know my role. I am the dancing monkey.' But that dodge didn't satisfy his broadcast-news interlocuter: 'The reality of it is – and this is no joke – there are a lot of people out there who do turn to you.' 'Not for news,' Stewart countered, and they were off again.  What was at stake in this debate between two men, a generation apart in age (Stewart is 42, Koppel 64), both of whom host some version of a late-night daily talk show on current events? Clearly, Koppel's beef went far beyond the question of whether most folks who watch The Daily Show do so for yuks. (As a long-term viewer, I would contend that of course they do, and that anyone who can't tell the difference between Stewart's out-there satire and actual investigative reporting is too dumb to understand the 'real' news anyway.) No, the battle of the network anchors was about nothing less than the future of TV journalism.  Koppel, a venerable holdout from the era of the three-network system, stands up for the beleaguered notion of an objective truth that journalists can wrest from politicians, protect from satirists, and bring to the American public. Stewart, on the other hand, finds it 'dispiriting' that broadcast news has become complicit with the pre-spun narratives coming from both left and right: 'It's Coke and Pepsi talking about beverage truth.' And yet Koppel is far from naïve – he quickly concedes that the convention-as-product-launch concept is 'one I'd like to steal sometime' – and Stewart is no jaded Gen-X cynic. At one point, he even encourages Koppel to use the bully pulpit of Nightline to speak truth to power: 'You can say, 'That's B.S.' You don't need humor, because you have what I wish I had, which is credibility and gravitas.'  Wednesday night's discussion came to an abrupt end when Stewart, who was clearly ready to go on talking, was told by a polite but brusque Koppel, 'You're finished.' To my mind, Stewart (who, crushed-out fans like myself will be keen to hear, was looking foxy-fine in a casual black sweater and jeans) won the day. But I was looking forward to Round Two on Thursday, when Koppel was scheduled to be Stewart's guest on The Daily Show. Koppel never showed, and his absence went unmentioned. Last-minute scheduling snafu, or anchorman blood feud? A call to the Daily Show office to find out went unanswered, so I'll have to leave you to speculate on that one. What do you think I am, a news reporter?    Where to start? First of all, I doubt that most of  The Daily Show's  audience gets  all  their news from  The Daily Show.  In fact, I think in this day in age it would be damn near impossible for anyone to get  all  his or her news from one source. My guess is that the people who do use it as their main source of information wouldn't seek out an alternate source if there was no  Daily Show  so at least they have some idea of what's going on in the world.  As for me, I find  The Daily Show  to be intelligent and practically a guaranteed laugh. And yes, sometimes, I learn stuff. In fact, I think one of the biggest strengths of the show is that it picks up on interesting and noteworthy stories that the mainstream media doesn't cover. Stories that otherwise would fall through the cracks and I don't mean just the  Back in Black  segments.  And  Jon  has a point.  Koppel  et all  could  use their power to do more than parrot back they're told to say by those in power. They choose not to. These days 'objective' seems to mean repeating the talking points without really analyzing let alone daring to question anything. The mainstream media has been practicing rigid self-censorship for at least the last 3 years.  Why do I watch  The Daily Show ? Because they can smell BS a mile a way and they'll call people on it.

2994443,Education,"              Relaxation and the nature of self  For once I feel refreshed after the weekend. Maybe I should have a bottle of wine every afternoon. I'm joking, of course.  The Canucks won their last game, and Colorado lost, meaning that Vancouver won the Northwest Division, coming third in the Western Conference and they get to play Calgary in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. I'm really looking forward to it - Graham's brother is a Flames fan so I guess we'll be taunting each other every time they play. It's best of 7, the first game this weekend.  Jenson Button got on the podium for the second time in a row - amazing. So cool. It almost made up for the fact that Ferrari got another 1-2 and Michael Schumacher is running away with the championship. My driver of the day was Sato though - he was never that far behind Button and did a great job considering his lack of experience.  I finished Hey Nostrodamus! on Saturday -  all in all I found it a very good back, and I found the ending quite satisfying, unlike Graham who thought the whole of the last chapter sucked. I'm halfway into a new book now and so is Graham - we've started to spend time with each other reading instead of watching the TV recently, which has been really nice. I decided on Saturday that we don't use the rooms in our house enough, so we decamped to the bigger of the spare rooms and spent the afternoon in there - me perched on the beanbag and him sprawled on the futon, listening to the rain come hammering down and getting lost in our individual literary worlds.  We built up our stock of wine on Saturday after visiting one of those wine warehouses. 12 good quality bottles (including 2 champagnes...ahem...I mean sparkling wine...for £75, which was a pretty good deal. We even managed to get our hands on a bottle of Mission Hill pinot blanc - a Canadian favourite of ours (the wine is made in the Okanagan Valley in BC where we're visiting this year).   Watched Adaptation on Saturday night - made by the same people as Being John Malkovich. It wasn't nearly as good, but I quite enjoyed it anyway. Graham had his work cut out trying not to fall asleep.  I'm looking forward to going to London this weekend. Alex's bar should be really good - it's a piano bar with cocktails and stuff, and it's all relaxed and dress-down - he likes to call it Shabby Chic. He-he. Wonder if he regrets that soundbite.  I was doing a hell of a lot of thinking this weekend, about everything under the sun. It was good to exercise my brain. I may share some of the thoughts with you later in the week if I don't get sidetracked by the everyday.  Last Friday I was on the bus and I saw this guy talking to himself - just saying random things. Not gobbledegook - proper sentences, but nothing that had any relevance to what was going on around him. I got to thinking - what if I'm like that. What if I am just walking around in my own little world, talking to all these characters, living what I think is my life when in reality I am some madwoman roaming around in a box room talking to the walls, talking to myself, making up situations in my head, acting them out and being observed by people who are trying to understand what's going on in that brain of mine? It's something I used to think about a lot when I was younger, but that thought hadn't crossed my mind recently until Friday. Maybe I think my life is more important these days so I find it hard to imagine that such an important life is actually all a figment of my imagination?         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2991302,Non-Profit,"                 The day of the Euro 2004 clash between England and France came and it was stormy on Ko Chang. Subsequently, I played cards all day and Roy (from Israel) was duped into a game of 'Skinhead', which is like shithead but the loser get's his head shaved. Of course, he lost and I shaved him silly! To prove I would do it in good will I also offered to cut Stacey's fringe but made a bit of a mess of it! Because of that, Roy didn't trust me throughout the entire ordeal.  The game happened......and, boy was I dissapointed! The good thing was that the locals and the owners of Nature Beach were throwing plenty of whiskey and rum around so I was able to drown my sorrows.   The locals (Dar, Tos, Joe and San) have been so friendly here other than just free drinks - There's a guy called Keith from Newcastle who lives behind the huts and I mistakedly gate-crashed his house when I saw that he had a pool table - I thought it was a pub! So nice though and it cost him next to nuppence to build the house and buy everything in it.  San and Joe run the bar and they do a brilliant cockney accent! San is also the spitting image of Pharrell Williams from N*E*R*D!  I met a canadian girl called Terri who was very nice but was quite anti-english when the football came on.   The day after the game, most people had left the Island and I had to fend for myself.  I had my last 2 dives and completed my Open Water Course which was good to have under my belt. However, that morning, they were exploding bombs underwater (for safety reasons) that had been left dormant for years. That would explain the ground shaking at 8am then! It also brought up lots of silt and mud from the seabed and visibility was poor. My instructor said afterwards though that I was the only person on Ko Chang diving that day and if I can dive in those conditions, I can pretty much dive anywhere!  After my diving I basically read my book in the restaurant and some Thai girls (Hada and Jula) were on holiday and I spent the afternoon with them. It turns out that they work on the island and do massage a few beaches up so I got all sorts of massage freebies! Nice!  My last day on Ko Chang, was on Tuesday and it rained all day so I slept in the hammock until the evening. My bag packing was rudely interrupted by a typhoon hitting the island and all the power went so I was sat in the dark in my room with coconuts hitting the roof!  Eventually the power did come back on and I watched the Football and was chatting to a girl called Cassandra from Singapore. I had recollections of Wayne's World and I couldn't work out if I was Garth or Wayne!? She is very nice though and I will try and meet her when I get to Singapore.  As I didn't want to be stranded on Ko Chang when my trek from Bangkok to Singapore starts (on the 17th June - Today!), I left for Bangkok a day early.  Places aren't nearly as bad the second time around and I ended up having a really good night in Bangkok. I found the hotel where the trek starts and stopped for a coffee in a cafe just outside. There I met Fran, Vicky and Laurelle who are all from Reading and are in Thailand for a month. I ended up being their guide for Banglahmpu and around Khao Sarn Road as they had just arrived. We all had a nice meal and ended up getting drunk in Silk's Bar which was playing some 'Proper Bo' music - All old school hip hop and house stuff - and the Spain v Greece game. I stumbled home after the game but not before a Thai bloke bought me a drink and we chatted about the football - turns out he was a policeman!  I've checked into my hotel now and it's the most luxury I've experienced since The Farm! There's even hot water - Hurrah!  I'm sharing a room with a guy called Tom from Ipswich who is, as he puts it, a liability - but other than that, I think he just knows how to have a good time!  I have to get back to the hotel now for the briefing but there will be an update soon as I arrive in Kho Phan Ngan in a few days.  (Oh, by the way, Dorian is a spiky (not Pikey!) fruit which loads of people eat here but is smells like vomit and doesn't taste much better - Subsequently, most hotels have a ban on them as it stinks the place out!)

2983546,indUnk,"           In another blog, someone brought up the  Canadian Health Care Is No Model for U.S.  article written by Jay Lehr, Ph.D.and published by The Heartland Institute and The Galan Institute.  It is good to some degree, but there are a couple of points I wanted to comment on.    'The Canadian system is built around a compulsory public insurance regime that provides most medical and hospital services free.' Lemieux adds that the system is not, of course, free for the Canadian taxpayer. Twenty-two percent of all taxes raised in Canada are spent on its health care system.   Left out here was that citizens in Alberta and British Columbia are also required to pay monthly premiums. Also left out is the fact that public funding accounts for less than three-quarters of the total funding for health care. 27.3 percent of the funding comes through supplementary insurance (such as Blue Cross), employer-sponsored benefits or from the users’ own pockets.   In Canada, it is illegal to seek or convey private medical assistance.   This is completely false. There are plenty of medical services that are not funded by the government. Examples include dentists, optometrists, chiropractors, cosmetic surgeons, massage therapists and some services and surgeries provided for by private clinics. Canada has both private and public medical services available.   Physicians are told by the government how much they can charge for their services;   This is a half truth. Compensation for physician services is negotiated between the provinces and the provincial medical associations on the basis of fee and utilization increases, subject to various forms of individual physician or global ceilings.   The supply of medical services in Canada is completely rationed, with no significant private alternative.   Interesting. First, Mr Lehr states that it is illegal to seek or convey private medical assistance, but then he implies such assistance exists, albeit to an insignificant degree.   My own personal contacts with Canadians support a recent article in the Montreal Gazette, in which a Canadian woman described the frequent rudeness of unionized Canadian medical staff as compared to the 'kindness, discretion, and professionalism' of staff members in U.S. hospitals.   In that case, the humanitarian attitudes of American medical workers must be phenomenal because my experience with Canadian medical staff has been filled with kindness, discretion and professionalism. In fact, earlier this week I had to go see two different specialists—to which I might add took my doctor less than two weeks to schedule the appointments—and on both occasions, I felt very comfortable and we even had jovial conversations.   Americans...should have no interest in seeing their health care deteriorate to the level of Canada's 'free' system.   How lovely. Now our system is dilapidated.  Mr Lehr started out with a good idea, but sure seems to resort to a lot of rhetoric and individual experiences. The article seems to be little more than a scare tactic.  Canada’s system needs improvements. Absolutely, but the USA does not have a perfect system either.",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2983546,indUnk,"           We went to Sven Erickson’s for the first time. It’s been six years and it was the first time we’ve gone to this restaurant for supper. It was tasty food. The children eat free during the week, so with that discount, the bill came to around 35$. It even came with hors d'oeuvres, French onion soup and a loaf of bread. I had three-cheese tortellini with sautéed chicken strips.  The atmosphere was nice, too. Classier than casual, but not stuffy.

2983546,indUnk,"           Over at  urlLink By Common Consent , a discussion is ensuing regarding the eternal family. I've always had a bit o' difficulty with the use of the phrase 'families can be forever'. Let me explain.  I am sealed to my parents. As such, I am supposed to be able to live with them in the Celestial Kingdom. I am sealed to my wife. As such, I am supposed to be able to live with her in the Celestial Kingdom. I am sealed to my children. As such, I am supposed to be able to live with them in the Celestial Kingdom. The same will happen with grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc, as well as grandparents, great-parents etc (so long as they accept the work that has been done for them).  The premise then is that we will all live together in one place. When you take into consideration how everyone is related potentially to each other and can trace lineages back to Adam, everyone will be living together as one big forever family.  Now consider the thought that we apparently will be gods and goddesses over our own worlds. If each couple is reigning over their own world, how can all of the couple be living together as one big eternal family?  Sometimes, I wonder if the sealing is more than simply linking parents to children. Sometimes, I wonder if it is more a way to seal our exaltation.                 urlLink Read more...                 ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2955971,indUnk,"       I've missed a few days posting because I've been so busy.  Starting my job on Monday, I spent most of that day running around getting things set up.  Tuesday, I got my first tape to transcribe.  As I worked that day - what ended up being a lot longer than I had hoped, 8-10 hours total, but I'm not sure on the time because, of course, there were times I stopped to tend to R's needs and make a salad to eat and such - I started thinking this would never work out.  I felt I would never catch on.  I was totally, completely exhausted and I could scarcely think straight.  It took me all day to just complete the first side of the tape.  The problem is that my perfectionism came out.  My boss had just told me to type it up and not worry about the words I didn't get.  But I just couldn't.  I had to try to look up what each word I didn't know sounded like and then try to figure it out.  I did pretty well.  There were still a couple I didn't get, that I couldn't find, and one my boss told me what it was when I told her what it sounded like.  It was two medical words joined, so I wasn't sure.  When I finished the other side on Wednesday, after J's surgery and getting home, it only took about an hour or so.  That side was also only about 1/2, but it was considerably faster for me since I'd mastered almost all of the words.  So, by Wednesday, my confidence had grown.  Wednesday morning was J's surgery.  He did really well and it was only about an hour and 1/2 before the Dr. came out to tell us it was over and went well.  They kept him overnight because of his sleep apnea.  That was nice because I would have been very worried about him and probably not slept well.  R was a doll the whole time we were waiting!  She really behaved and was a real sweetie, making the nurses and other people in the waiting room smile a lot.  I read an entire American Girls Samantha book to her (it's the doll she wants - but they are about $65.00, so we'll have to see about it for Christmas or her birthday).  We played Barbie's and she had a workbook or activity book that she worked on, too.  Right about the time she was growing bored, the Dr. was done and the 45 minutes of Jay's recovery that we had to wait had passed.  We went back to see him and R was all teary.  She'd been worried and really needed to see him.  We stayed for only about another 45 minutes because I knew I needed to come home to do my work and didn't know how long it would take me.  R layed on J's bed with him and cuddled.  J asked me to bring back a DVD for him as he wanted to watch something since the TV stunk and he didn't like their movies.  I told him it would depend on how much work I got done.  Of course, I felt awful about that, but what could I do?  My working changes our family in a lot of positive ways, but it also changes it in some negative ways and that's what I think he'll have a hard time adjusting to.  Thankfully, since my work didn't take long on Wednesday, we were able to go back and take the movie to J and stay a while with him.  Now, on the other hand, R is doing great with the changes my working brings!  She's had to be more responsible and do things (that most other 7 and 8 year olds probably do) like dress herself, wash her own hair, regularly making her bed - which was patchy before, getting her own things to drink ----I know, I have terribly spoiled her.  But she's been loving being so independent!  It's been wonderful.  She's even told me she'd get her own breakfast some mornings.  She's done really well.  My girl sure is amazing.  And it's odd how I feel closer to her - I guess because of this change in our relationship.  We've been laughing and playing together more.  Probably because I'm not spending as much time doing stuff for her - lol.  Anyway, it's been great for she and I.  Okay, so I took my work in to my boss on Thursday after we picked J up from the hospital.  She was heading out of town and had forgotten about meeting me!  lol.  Her office manager was in, though, and called her.  She told me to leave the work there, she'd check it out and call me Monday to come pick up another tape and do corrections on what I turned in.  She knew J had surgery, too, and knew I needed to look after him and was tired.  She's just the sweetest lady and I'm so grateful to be working for her.  So, I'm off until Monday.  That's good as I had plenty of errands to run, including picking up a water pik for J for cleaning out his nose 3 times a day.  It's really helped him to feel better.  And I've gotten some much needed rest after all the craziness.  Got my hair cut and colored red again today.  Most of the color had gone out as it had been about 10 weeks.  I had gotten back to being pretty blond.  My hairdresser says my natural color is a medium blond with some mild red highlights.  But she thought I should go darker this time on the red.  I did.  I'm a little freaked out about it.  It's a bit more shocking, but it will tame in about a week and then I'll see if I really like it.  And my poor hairdresser!  She called to reschedule me earlier than next week because Monday she has to have surgery for a torn rotator cuff!  I don't know how she kept doing her job, but she kept most appointments.  She can't work for 3 months after, though.  So she's got some ladies at the same salon who will take over for her.  I told her I'd see how things go because, shoot, she's been doing my hair for.....I think 12 years!  I don't really want anyone else to do it.  So we'll see if I can handle letting it go 3 months.  I don't know, though.  We've had continuous rain here since Monday.  Swim team practice was managed for Monday night and Tuesday morning, but not since.  The weather's been so bad and then the heater at the pool broke down!  There is a swim meet tomorrow, but her swim teacher doesn't think R is ready and I have to agree.  So we'll skip this one.  Lots of the kids her age skip them or just go watch them.  Instead, we're heading to the library tomorrow.  They're having a puppet show at 10:00 a.m. and then we'll get her stuff for the Summer Reading Program checked.  She gets a paperback book and some stickers and stuff for the 2 weeks we've read every day.  I'm so proud of her with her reading.  My brother, who is a teacher, says she's reading on a 3rd grade level - only struggling with 4th grade level words.  She read her other Samantha book on her own and only asked me what about 5 words were.  These are good size chapter books!  It's exciting to me that she's loving reading so much...and math.    Can't really think of anything else I might have missed.  Guess I'll go post some stuff at my e-mail group.                     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2943631,Education,"            Back to our regular programming...  Ok folks with all that out of the way( see post below this one) I want to share two pieces about hurtful words.  The first one I wrote today on my way to my interview as a lashing out at the people I intended to insult.  It made me so pissed off, that in my words to them, I hurt other people who wrongly included themselves with them.  I am so mad that some people have hurt me so GD much that I find myself filled with hate, and creating more hate inadvertently.  So anyway I can't ever remember writing 5 poems in a day since the big p hit, and I was so upset about the whole thing.  Unfortunately all those works are lost forever, I gave them to a girl who lost them.  I am really sad that I have nothing left from that time of my life, it was such a raw, rough emotional time, even more than now.  Oh well enjoy.  Oh and this is mainly to my old friends and people who pretended to be friends.  I hope you are smart enough to figure it out, but we haven't talked in so long, you don't even know about this address, so please to all don't be hurt by...  Hurtful words   I tried to tell you how I felt. You chose not to listen.  You now come back to check in, Full of morbid curiosity. Only now to see, My words hurtful to you.  Words I kept in, Feelings I repressed. I was trying to be nice, I was trying to get along. Kept telling myself, 'Its all for the best.'  I couldn't do it any longer, Bad hurt feelings, Got worse and grew stronger, Slowly Sprouting Into  hurtful words.  Don't be so vain, To think its all about you. That when I say  hurtful words Their pointed to you, Alone. Allot of people have hurt me, Allot of old friends now gone away. So don't feel so special If I do throw  your way, A few, Hurtful words.   Ok second one I wrote a while back when I was fighting back and forth verbally with my spouse.  Fighting always tends to hurt so much more when you are doing it with someone you love so much.  I don't have a time frame down other than I believe it was early last year as I signed it with my old male name, enjoy.  Your words have weight   Your words have weight Your opinion to me matters. Your words can hurt or heal... Your words can put down of flatter...  Your words have weight, They just don't drift into the air. They can take me up high... They can crush me into despair...  Your words have weight, They press against my soul. The bad ones tend to pile up fast, And magnify their toll.  Your words have weight, And I am feeling crushed. I try to let them roll off, But they have got me flushed.  Your words have weight, I hope mine do too. And I hope the weight of my words, Lets you know how much I love you.

2931298,Manufacturing,"       It really sucks to be the Assistant to the Directory of the company you work for...  This job is the worst job ever! (socially speaking). The last time I had a nice social relationship with my coworkers was a year ago, right before my Boss got fired, after that I became bitter.  What is the relation between being the Boss's assistant and not being able to socialize nicely with anybody? Do I look that intimadating? I don't think so!.  I remember back when I started working for a real company that looking at the Director's assistant was like looking at the 'Venus of the Nile'. Those nice looking girls with high heels and expensive clothes, expensive shoes, expensive make up and expensive haircuts were very impressing to me, but often the people around would say the Director's assistant was a 'witch'. I don't consider myself a witch (at least I don't look like one).  Working as the Director's assistant for 5 years now really is not all that and a bag of chips, on the contrary, it really is alot of responsibilities and yes!, I have to act like a bitch, not a witch, a bitch, and being bitchy is not easy, most if you were not born to be a bitch, but what can we assistants do?   If nobody in this company liked me before, because as I said one time all the 'women parrots' in this company looked at me like a weird specimen, after acting really bitchy with everybody due to 'management change' and my new boss requires a 'Hulk' by his side to assist him. Well guess who has to be that 'Hulk'? Everybody will end up liking me less. So I guess I earned it right? And now I have to pay for it, Heck! I think I've been paying for it ever since I started working in this joint so called 'company' 6 months ago. The only people who half speak to me are men plus one married manager with children who is 'secretly harassing me' (gross!).  My punishments for being the Director's assistant are:  1.- I have to stare at the monitor doing nothing and acting as I am working when I really have nothing to work on instead of going to the department next to me and have a little chit chat with the group or sneak around other departments just to say hello to everybody like everybody does here.  2.- Not be invited to any company group events because I am the bitch in the house which really sucks! (I wouldn't go anyway but still is nice to know you're invited somewhere)  3.- Stare at the window looking people passing on the street which having lunch.  4.- My only friend at lunch breaks is a book that I almost finish (that reminds me I have to get another book)          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2922061,Publishing,"          As I remember Mr. Bush pressed the war as urgent claiming that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction (chemicals, maybe nuclear in the making). I don't even see the Bush administration mention that now. Apparently because no evidence has appeared. This is what I mean by 'under false pretenses'.    I think you're confused about 'legitimacy.' In the internationalist view, a military action by one nation against another can be 'legitimate' only if it is approved by the U.N. Security Council. Once the war has begun, without Security Council approval, it's always 'illegitimate.' It doesn't matter if the warring nation's pre-war statements prove to be true.  The overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan was illegitimate, in this view, and so was the NATO attacks on Serbia that saved the Muslims in Kosovo from ethnic cleansing, and so was the overthrow of Saddam. All alike, equally, were 'illegitimate.' The attack on Iraq would have been just as illegitimate, in this view, if the WMD had been discovered.  But let's allow you to take a position of convenience, however untenable, for the sake of following through on this argument, and let 'legitimacy' be determined by the reasons the U.S. gave for its desire to overthrow Saddam in 2003.  I don't know anyone whose entire support of the decision to overthrow Saddam was based on the notion that he had WMD. For those of us who supported the administration in this, it always was a mix of motives.  I was not convinced of any real working relationship between his regime and al Qaida. In fact, the level of contact between them that was revealed by the U.S. 9/11 Committee report actually was more than I thought existed. I was surprised.  But a strong pillar of my support for this war was the 'anti-totalitarian' justification. Saddam was a tyrant. His people suffered cruelly. It is the duty of free peoples to help those in slavery. Sometimes this is only done by war, which is always horrible and destructive. It was especially our duty, as Americans, to see that this was done because we had helped prop up Saddam in the 1980s. Our involvement with him was less than that of others -- the Europeans sold him most of the weapons he used on Iran and the Kurds -- but just because they felt no responsibility for him doesn't mean we shouldn't have, either.  Eastern European intellectuals like Vaclav Havel, who remember the repressions of the Soviets, and the role of the NATO nations in ending those repressions, supported the war against Saddam on these grounds.  Adam Michnik, the leading force in the Solidarity trade union movement who founded and edits Poland's largest daily newspaper, put it like this:   We take this position because we know what dictatorship is. And in the conflict between totalitarian regimes and democracy you must not hesitate to declare which side you are on. Even if a dictatorship is not an ideal typical one, and even if the democratic countries are ruled by people whom you do not like. I think you can be an enemy of Saddam Hussein even if Donald Rumsfield is also an enemy of Saddam Hussein. ... It's simply that life has taught me that if someone is being whipped and someone is whipping this person, I am always on the side of those who are being whipped.  I've always criticized U.S. foreign policy for forgetting that the United States should defend those who need to be defended. I would object to U.S. policy if it supported Saddam Hussein, and I have always criticized the United States for supporting military regimes in Latin America.  I asked my French and German friends, Are you afraid that tomorrow Bush will bomb Paris? And can you really be sure that terrorists and fundamentalists will not attack the Louvre? So which side are you on?'   Ultimately, though, the WMD threat was the one that got the most play, the most press, and it seems, in retrospect, like Bush and his friends said nothing else. But that's hindsight. Certainly the anti-war crowd is going to make it seem that way, because that threat turned out to not live up to the dramatic urgency that it was cloaked in before the war.  I was concerned about the certainty that, if left to himself, Saddam would get or make WMD and use them. I thought he probably had something up his sleeve. I guess I was wrong about that, but not entirely. And it was never my sole reason for backing the war.  It was never the Bush administration's sole stated reason, either. For instance, a key document in the march to war is the White House Background Paper on Iraq,  urlLink 'A Decade of Deception and Defiance' , which served as a background paper for Bush's Sept. 12 speech to the United Nations General Assembly.   One-seventh of it, by my rough estimate, is devoted to WMD.  Other headline sections in the report are: Saddam Hussein's Repression of the Iraqi People, Refusal to Admit Human Rights Monitors, Violence Against Women, Torture, Saddam Hussein's Abuse of Children, Disappearances, Withholding of Food, and Crimes Against Muslims. Altogether almost twice as much space is given to human rights abuses as is given to WMD. Another section is titled 'Saddam Hussein's Defiance of United Nations Resolutions,' and more than twice as much space is devoted to this as to WMD.  Other topics in the report: Saddam Hussein's Support for International Terrorism, Saddam Hussein's Refusal to Account for Gulf War Prisoners, Saddam Hussein's Refusal to Return Stolen Property, Saddam Hussein's Efforts to Circumvent Economic Sanctions.  The WMD threat was played up by the U.S. and the British in the weeks before the war. In part, Bush did this to give Powell, the internationalist in his cabinet, a chance to accomplish something. In part, he did it as a courtesy to Blair, who faced intense political pressure not to send British troops into battle without U.N. support. But also in part -- I think in large part -- this was done because it was the one issue that the U.N. had taken a position on. The U.S. and its allies were seeking the 'legitimacy' of a U.N. approval, and at the same time they were seeking to force the U.N. to stand up and be something but an anti-U.S./anti-Israel bitchfest.  The Iraq resolutions were the exact right place to do that. The U.N., after all, takes no positions on internal matters such as whether a tyrant can feed parents alive into a shredding machine in front of their children. Or whether a dictator can kidnap young girls off the streets to serve as his 'girlfriends.'  Bush rolled two questions into his efforts at the U.N. before the war: 'Will you give us approval to overthrow Saddam,' and, 'Are you a real world governing body, with teeth, or just a paper mill that churns out threats that are never going to be enforced.'  Iraq wasn't the most serious problem in the world in March 2003? Looking back, probably not. But how could the U.N. bring any pressure to bear on North Korea, on Iran, if after 17 condemning resolutions against Iraq, each one of them torn up by the dictator, it did nothing but rally its members to protect Saddam from American pressure? The U.N. was adept at passing 'resolutions,' but the body itself was far from 'resolute.'  Then again, according to Europeans, Iran and North Korea weren't 'the largest threat to world peace' in 2003, either. Fifty-nine percent of Europeans said that Israel is a larger threat to world peace than North Korea, Iran or Afghanistan, according to a European Commission survey of approximately 7,500 Europeans, released in November (after the EU tried to suppress the embarrassing results). Given a list of 15 countries, including Iran and North Korea, Israel was listed as the greatest threat to world peace. El Pais reported that.  As Tony Blair put it, after the Lord Hutton report which (again) resolved him of lying:   The truth is, as was abundantly plain in the motion before the House of Commons on 18 March, we went to war to enforce compliance with UN Resolutions. Had we believed Iraq was an imminent direct threat to Britain, we would have taken action in September 2002; we would not have gone to the UN. Instead, we spent October and November in the UN negotiating UN Resolution 1441. We then spent almost 4 months trying to implement it.  Actually, it is now apparent from the Survey Group that Iraq was indeed in breach of UN Resolution 1441. It did not disclose laboratories and facilities it should have; nor the teams of scientists kept together to retain their WMD including nuclear expertise; nor its continuing research relevant to chemical weapons and biological weapons. As Dr Kay, the former head of the ISG who is now quoted as a critic of the war has said: 'Iraq was in clear violation of the terms of Resolution 1441.' And 'I actually think this [Iraq] may be one of those cases where it was even more dangerous than we thought.' '   Since the war, report after report, always played by the media as damning or condemning the West's WMD intelligence, has confirmed that Saddam actively sought banned weapons systems, concealed technologies to make them, and would gladly have used them.  Consider this, from the most recent report (Lord Butler's). Iraq:   a. Had the strategic intention of resuming the pursuit of prohibited weapons programmes, including if possible its nuclear weapons programme, when United Nations inspection regimes were relaxed and sanctions were eroded or lifted.  b. In support of that goal, was carrying out illicit research and development, and procurement, activities, to seek to sustain its indigenous capabilities.  c. Was developing ballistic missiles with a range longer than permitted under relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions; but did not have significant -- if any -- stocks of chemical or biological weapons in a state fit for deployment, or developed plans for using them. (Paragraph 474).   As Butler, Kay, and many others who investigated the matter after the war concluded, the only reason Saddam didn't have massive stockpiles of WMD was that the U.N. sanctions and the international effort had kept him from getting the materials, or from running the factories, to make them. We now know the sanctions succeeded in keeping weapons out of Saddam's hands, but they were a cruel disaster for the Iraqi people.  And this containment system was breaking down. If you remember, before the U.S. was hated for going to war in Iraq, it was hated for the sanctions, which despite the U.N. imprimatur, were blamed entirely on the U.S. There's a bumper on a truck in my neighborhood that has a 'no blood for oil' sticker on it now, atop what was a 'visualize Iraqi children' sticker that was there before 2003. France, among others, had begun to cheat on the sanctions.  What is often forgotten, too, is that the anti-war voices before March 2003 also thought Saddam had WMD. They knew he was a murderous tyrant, they believed he had lethal city-destroying weapons stashed away, and they STILL opposed the war to overthrow him. They wanted to end the sanctions, and replace them with nothing.  For instance, the German magazine  Spiegel,  which has been relentless in its coverage of the Bush 'lies' about WMD, apparently changed its thinking since it wrote:   “In the meantime it is a certainty: The greater part of the technology for Saddam’s  horror potential  comes from Germany. ... Whether it was Saddam’s project to build an atomic bomb or his  enormous arsenal of chemical weapons  – German technology was always there. ... By the Iraqi poison gas production, deliveries from Germany made up more than 50 percent. In the nuclear field, it was at least as much. The modification of the Soviet Scud-B rockets was almost entirely in German hands: 90 percent of the technology came from the land of inventors and dealers [Germany].” [emphasis added]    Spiegel  thought Saddam was plenty dangerous in that article. They also reported that UN weapon’s inspectors had concluded “Saddam was just another 18 months away, the IAEO estimates, from producing the fissile material for the atom bomb. ... According to Western estimates, Baghdad paid 10 billion dollars in its attempt to become the first Arab nuclear power.”  So: 1. the WMD claim was not the only stated reason for the U.S. and its allies going to war against Saddam; 2. the other reasons given, such as the humanitarian crisis in the country, were amply documented and have proven to be, if anything, worse than feared; 3. the WMD part of the reason for war, though partially based on faulty intelligence, was also partly true, and key players have agreed that Iraq was, in fact, in violation of resolution 1441.  Therefore, I say the war was 'legitimate,' based on the claims made by the warring parties before their attack.    The main reason claimed to start the war has disappeared now, which makes me think that it was a pretext. And which was the real reason then? A geopolitical vision - the Middle East reengineered from a Western-style democracy (or at least a protectorate) in Irak. Do you think I am wide of the mark on this? It was not even a secret. The Wall Street Journal had editorials saying just this 2 years ago.    No, of course you're not wide of the mark in saying that the U.S. had an interest in lifting the Middle East out of the sewer it had become: a repressive and brutish cesspool of the world that breeds religious freaks and murdering thugs. And the interest in that was dramatically driven home to Americans on Sept. 11, 2001, even though the more thoughtful and generous amongst us had seen that interest long before (I confess, I was not one of them).  I see nothing damnable about that. If our response to 9/11 had simply been to go out and kill as many terrorists as we could find, that would have been an imperfect, lopsided response, deserving of blame. To do that, but also to take one important chunk of this dangerous ground and try to turn it into a model for the rest of the Islamic/Mideast peoples, that seems to be a noble cause befitting a great nation.  That the execution of it has been, in many instances, woeful and flawed is no reflection on the legitimacy of the vision.  And since I disagree with you that the weapons threat from Iraq was a fake, then I also disagree with you that this is an 'either-or' choice, that the U.S. simply invented a weapons threat from Saddam to mask its 'secret' plan for Iraq (so secret that it was published in the newspapers).  Your false dichotomy ('weapons threat or U.S. geopolitical plotting') of explanations for the war omits the anti-totalitarian justification that was so important to me and many other war supporters, and was much spoken of by Bush and Blair.  I'm confused by your phrase 'Western-style' democracy. What is that? I wasn't aware democracy had different regional flavors.  Do you think bringing democracy and freedom to Iraq is a bad thing? Is democracy only for 'Western' nations? Are Arabs somehow incapable of it?  This gift to Iraq needn't be seen as altruistic. As with the overthrow of Saddam (which could have been accomplished without any commitment to democracy), the noble motives and the American self-interest merge nicely. Peggy Noonan laid out the national-interest case for democratic Iraq this week in the  Wall Street Journal :   I do not feel America is right to attempt to help spread democracy in the world because it is our way and therefore the right way. Nor do I think America should attempt to encourage it because we are Western and feel everyone should be Western. Not everyone should be Western, and not everything we do as a culture, a people or an international force is right.   Rather, we have a national-security obligation to foster democracy in the world because democracy tends to be the most peaceful form of government. Democracies tend to be slower than dictatorships to take up arms, to cross borders and attempt to subdue neighbors, to fight wars. They are on balance less likely to wreak violence upon the world because democracies are composed of voters many of whom are parents, especially mothers, who do not wish to see their sons go to war. Democracy is not only idealistic, it is practical.   What's sad is that, for many people in the world, when it's a choice between the U.S. and anybody else, they'll take anybody else. If it's a choice between the U.S. and Saddam, the world comes down on the side of the genocidal sadist. In the Afghan war, if it's a choice between the U.S. and the women-enslaving, statue-smashing, gay-executing Taliban, the world pours into the streets of its respective capitals to side with the Taliban and denounce the Americans.  I must correct you on another point. You write, 'Apparently because no evidence [of WMD] has appeared.' That's wrong. They have been found. Sarin shells, and worse things have turned up in Iraq. Banned missiles sat in hiding spots there. What the inspectors haven't found (yet) is a big pile of weapons labelled 'Saddam's banned WMD.'  The intelligence that the U.S. used was flawed. Intelligence is an imperfect business. We found some banned things we never thought Saddam had. We didn't find some others we thought he did have.  An example of the imperfect nature of intelligence is the Niger uranium claim. Europeans, especially France, have much better intelligence-gathering in West Africa than the U.S. Almost every European intelligence service thought Saddam was trying to buy uranium in Africa. One European intelligence agency had been monitoring a uranium-smuggling operation involving Iraq for three years. The CIA did a terrible job of checking on this; it sent one agent, who had a grudge, who only stayed a week, and who didn't even bother filing a written report. As a result, the only folks who didn't think Saddam was trying to buy African uranium were the CIA. In this case the British and Europeans were right, and the Americans were wrong.  But you can be forgiven for believing that 'no WMD' have been found in Iraq, or that 'Bush lied' about the African uranium, because that's what all the major media, and the Democratic politicians, have been saying. And nobody corrects them.  Why the administration doesn't make this known is beyond my ability to comprehend. At times it seems possessed by a perverse inability to make its own case. Although I agree with Bush's foreign policy conceptions, I find his execution of them, as of most things he tries to do, massively inept. But, politically, I'd rather support the bumbler who is trying to do the thing I think is right than the smooth operator who has his head in all the wrong places.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2922061,Publishing,"       The question isn't whether Iraq is a mess right now. By anyone's measure of civic life, it is. Some observers prefer to focus on the progress being made (there's a lot of that), but that doesn't erase the kidnappings, killings and thug law that affect too many people's lives over there. The country still has a long way to go.   But the difference in people over here is, whether they are pulling for it to succeed, or whether they are sitting back on the fence and gloating over every evidence of failure, magnifying every setback, simply because they want to see GWB stew in his juices. As though one life were worth more than 25 million. These people attach way too much importance to one Republican president.

2922061,Publishing,"       It is possible both to burn with personal shame and rage at the fools Abu Ghraib, who threw away so much for so little, and at the same time to remind other people to keep  the reaction to  their criminal folly in perspective. The incident itself is one thing; the way it has been received around the world is another. Here's a good example of perspective, by a voice from the Middle East that is no American lackey:   Absolutes are appealing, but in imposing them, moralists must consider two points: That only a system which responds to censure through amelioration can eventually set lawful standards of behavior; and that some of Washington's more zealous Middle Eastern critics often avoided applying a universal ethical yardstick when considering what took place under Saddam - even as the US today accepts their moral privilege to condemn its actions in Abu Ghraib.  There is no justification (let alone a politically expedient rationale) for a host of recent American undertakings in Iraq - whether the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners or the bombardment of civilians in Falluja. However, there is also no excuse for denying that what we have seen in the past week in the US has been the thrashing about of a democratic system that feels disgraced by the behavior of several of its citizens, and that intends to rectify matters.   The Egyptian playwright Ali Salem told me recently that the true indignity of the Iraq war was that it was not Arabs who had overthrown Saddam Hussein. He was right. As Arabs examine the photographs from Abu Ghraib and read about American misconduct there, they might reflect less on what this says about the US, which usually ponders its worst excesses, than what it says about their own systems, where such images could only have been glimpsed over the carcass of an overthrown regime.    urlLink  Abu Ghraib, or how to lose some perspective on a very foul affair,   in the (Lebanon) 'Daily Star.'

2908515,Student,"             Well, upon the matter of my leaving, its had nothing to do with you.  I'm just at a point in my life where everything I do is pointless (heh) and that I can't find the joy of stuff anymore.  I mean, I pick up a video game and ready to have fun and whatnot but all I do is press buttons randomly hoping for a good outcome.  I pick up my pencil read to do some math homework but all I get is confused by the buttons of the calculator.  I have the phone in my hand and I'm ready to call some of my friends but I just don't for some odd reason.  Maybe I should take a break.  I mean, there are a couple of things that I still like to do.  For instance, I still like to talk to you.  You're a cool guy, no matter what you say.  I still like to take walks (but since there's no one to walk with me, I seldom do).  I like to cook (but since I have not the time)  I dunno.  I don't have such an active social life as you think.  Its funny how your e-mail came to me today.  I thought I had an okay social life yesterday.  But after today, I just realized that I don't.  Well, not just today, I had a feeling that I wasn't the most socially active person for a long time now.  I found out that some of my friends are going to baseball games and concerts without ever once thinking of inviting me.  Even though all of my efforts in the past where to include everyone I could think of in my outings.  Yet, no one mentions a concert that I would like to attend.  No one would even think of asking me.  I think it has to do with an incident a couple of years ago when someone asked me to go to a concert and I made some lame excuse not to go because I didn't have the money back then and I never like to borrow money from my parents.  I made some lame excuse like, 'I don't like concerts' or something like that.  And I guess they still believe that and don't even bother to invite me to anymore.  Sometimes thinking about it, it almost makes me tear up.  Its not even something so superficial as going to a concert.  I just want to be talked to and invited to things like I invited other people to things.  And there are a couple of concerts that I would love to go to but no one would go with me because they're too busy doing other things.  Today was just mentally exhausting.  After having been slapped in the face by the fact that I was excluded from such trivial yet important things like concerts and baseball games, I get slapped in the face again for being average in every single thing I do.  I hate whining to people.  But this has just been bugging me.  I'm not the smartest person in the class.  I'm not the greatest violinist in the orchestra.  I wasn't the fastest soccer player.  I'm not the best of anything.  Just average or slightly above.  But whats worse is that sometimes I grow to hate the people who are better than me.  Maybe not hate, but feel intensely jealous.  And that really sucks because thats a bad feeling.  Then I connect the state of being average to my problem with not being invited to places.  Then I think that maybe because of me being just a regular person that no one really takes notice of me enough to take me places.   I don't think I've had arguements with my friends.  But I can just never have a good conversation with them anymore.  Its not their fault but whenver I talk to them, they'll tell me about the stuff they do all the time.  Like how they need a new drum set because their band is doing a gig at some place.  Or how this person went to a tri-county whatnot with their orchestra.  I mean, I feel happy for them and stuff but I just feel left out.  Why can't I be in those things?  Oh wait, I know, because I'm insanely average.  Fuck.  Its not like I want to keep things from you.  So far, I've been honest and open.  I wouldn't decline any question directed towards me.  I don't think you're going to molest me (nerds aren't strong, right?)  Just kidding.  I'm just over-thinking things and being anal about everything (for a lack of a better phrase).  Popularity escapes my grasp, but yet it is so close that I can touch it sometimes.  It'll be cool to meet sometime.  It wouldn't be bad because we could meet again some other time after the initial meet.  I mean, its not like right after our meeting one of us will go off into war and never been heard from again.  I know that our meeting will not be bad because I know that we will continue to talk again.  Even if not through chat, then through e-mail.  I once had a penpal (online penpal) from Germany.  This nice girl about my age when I was about 13 or 14 years old.  We used to exchange e-mail letters everyday without fail.  She was so human.  She had flaws and she had strengths.  We had so many conversations and I learned so much stuff about Germany.  German word and phrases and foods.  But at the end of our time exchanging e-mail, something happened to her.  She was sent to the hospital for some sort of testing.  And I never really heard from her again.  I felt so bad and lonely.  You know?  All this time, two years or so, we spent e-mailing each other, and for her to just cut off so suddenly without a goodbye or anything, it just broke me.  And to think it, we never even chatted real time.  There was no IM'ing.  But it just ruined me.    The moral.  Well, not really a moral.  More of a transitition to this paragraph.  Matt.  If we are to continue talking, then you should some sort of promise or pact or whatever that you won't disappear to Japan without a goodbye or if not a goodbye then a pact/promise/whatever that you'll still continue writing.  The little girl in Germany managed to write to the little boy in America.  You could do the same in Japan.  I don't know what the future holds and I don't expect that much from the future.  Maybe we will meet.  And maybe not.  I sure hope we do.  I like to meet the person who is responsible for keeping me from so many assignements, papers, projects, and masturbation sessions.  Yea, too much information, I know.  The last one was for ha'ha's.  Anyway.  I'm going to Tahiti no matter what.  Its your choice whether or not you want to come with me.  The end.  Dennis.

2899531,indUnk,"       Wow.&nbsp; Tonight I saw the future in  urlLink Barack Obama . In case you haven't heard, he's being called the Tiger Woods, the new golden boy, and the future of the Democratic party...and a possible future presidential nominee, even though, for the time being, he's only an Illinois state senator.&nbsp; I hadn't even heard of him until fairly recently when  urlLink Tim  mentioned him to me a couple of weeks before I moved to Chicago. And once I moved up here, there's been so much hype around him in the news, especially in the wake of Jack Ryan's troubles.&nbsp; Still, like most people, I didn't really&nbsp;understand the hype because I didn't really know him and had never seen him speak.&nbsp; Until tonight.   I&nbsp;caught Hilary and Bill Clinton's speeches last night and Al Gore's today on the  urlLink DNC website .&nbsp; I really liked Bill Clinton's speech while Hilary's and Gore's were alright but kind of underwhelming, I thought...although I especially liked Gore's part in addressing voters for Nader in 2000...asking them, 'Do you still believe that there was no difference between the candidates?'   Tonight I was excited to hear Howard Dean speak, but he was also a bit underwhelming.&nbsp; So was Teresa Heinz Kerry.&nbsp; Although I agreed with Ron Reagan and&nbsp;supporting stem cell research, I thought he might have oversold it a little, maybe putting a&nbsp;bit too much optimism into it being the miracle he envisions it becoming.&nbsp; But the Democrats hit a home run tonight by having Barack Obama as the keynote speaker.&nbsp; He started off well, but you could literally see him picking up confidence and momentum as the speech went on, and it was perhaps the best speech I've ever seen.&nbsp; I wish I was at the Fleet Center to witness it in person and give a well-deserved standing ovation.&nbsp; One of the PBS analysts said that Obama's introduction to the national public via his speech&nbsp;tonight&nbsp;was transcendent across Republicans and Democrats,&nbsp;blacks and whites, men and women, and others.&nbsp; I agree wholeheartedly.   It's quite a shame that the major networks (ABC, NBC, and CBS) didn't air tonight's convention, although I'm assuming that the cable networks did.&nbsp; (The Chicago ABC, NBC, and CBS affiliates only broadcasted Obama's speech.)&nbsp; If you missed Obama's speech and you have high speed internet, go to the  urlLink DNC website &nbsp;and watch it.&nbsp; I doubt that any other speaker during the convention in the next two days will even come close to matching his speech.

2893848,Education,"              deep in the heart , part one  by Scott   a woman on the airplane to texas asked me if i had lost my baseball cap. i said i don't wear one and she politely replied, 'you look like you do.'   i didn’t know, and still don't know, if the all the peculiarities this weekend in austin were strictly texan, or if they were just appropriate for the atmosphere of a festival. i could have, in some sense, ate only barbeque ribs and zoned out for 4 days at say, the Sundance festival. nevertheless I was in awe constantly.   I've heard a man play a bassline across an old Ford gas tank. I've heard three 'i know ryan adams here's how ok back in raleigh' stories by the second night. i've watched as a guitar player stepped onto a 24 inch bass drum near the end of a song, only to realize he still must count out rhythm and move his fingers appropriately and at that instant slip, have his hands doubleback to catch him, leaving his guitar neck free to swing up and knock him unconscious. whack boom, him hitting the floor, although for a moment, like four seconds, the drummer kept playing, alone, finishing the measure over the stunned silence and awe, awe like an ape from between the bars of his cage grabbing your jacket sleeve at the zoo and not letting go, instead screaming at you for four seconds. i was winded. what was unsatisfying for emotional folks like me was that then the girl playing bass started crying. To others this was the shit. Oh the heckles!   it was good to be drunk, though. My ears started to ring due to the humidity and decibel levels; this too began to delight me after an extended period of time.   i've had an ATM on fourth avenue ask me for $3.75 to give me its twenties. when i yelped in disbelief, an old sage wearing a carmelo anthony jersey stopped trotting by to remark, 'people who give spare change to homeless people shouldn't have to be charged a fee for their twenties.' i agreed, bought him a slice of pizza, and asked him, since I was going, to accompany me to the texas capitol building.

2892926,Communications-Media,"             Well, I got a lot of stuff done this weekend that I thought I wasn't.  Jay, Church, and I went up to Molly's on Friday to watch U of L's collapse. However, it was good since there were 2 hot ladies that I had never met before that I got to converse with and switch digits with. The one that ended up giving off the vibe, was the one that I originally thought wasn't interested, due to her being quiet and on the phone for some time at the beginning. It all worked out, had a good time and went to bed at a reasonable hour.   After working a Blitz here for the bank on Saturday, I got home, conversed with my brother, and then went out to eat with Waggs and Anthony. Once we got finished eating, Anthony stops at KMart, to which me and Waggs were trying to figure out why the f we were there. Well Anthony said we were going to see if we could find an entertainment center for my pad. Of course I scoughed at the idea and said we would have a better shot of finding gold in a piece of dog shit. Well, we get back to the isles that have home furnishings and sure as shit there is a really good looking one from O Sullivan's that is on sale. It always happens this way, Anthony says something, everyone says it's bullshit, and in the end he's right. We eventually got a truck and picked up the entertainment center. Waggs decides to get the thing out and start working on it. After about 15 minutes, Anthony says, hey since we have the truck, why not go get a TV. I agreed and we went to Circuit City and spent about as much time in there as a McDonalds Drive Thru. I found the TV I had been looking at and had it in the back of the pickup in less than 10 minutes. Yeah I know most of the time you don't spend 10 minutes in the drive thru, but it was  very quick for picking up a larger size TV. Well, it all got done and we all got to watch some games on the new flat screen. Went up to Back Door after that, hung out, got some food and some drinks and just chilled. Thanks again to Waggs and Anthony for helping me do that.   Sunday, was family day. My Aunt was in town from NYC, so my other aunt had everyone over for dinner. It was a great time. My cousins brought their kids and we had a good time playing around, good food, good conversation. My Dad's side of the family is very artsy and pretty well read, so the conversation is usually pretty good, plenty of good stories, and a lot of laughs. It was good to see everyone and have a good time.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2892926,Communications-Media,"             Well kiddies let's talk about what's going on in the news.  I think it is sad that this country doesn't have 3 or 5 parties which have a strong showing every year. I mean if you still believe that the Democrats and Republicans vary that much when it comes to giving a damn about us, their constituents aka their bosses, then I guess you still leave your fallen out teeth under pillows thinking some fairy will come and drop off money and whisk your tooth or teeth away. The fact is both the Republicans and Democrats are a bunch of money and power hungry bastards that could give a rats ass if we all live or die, as long as they get elected and can vote themselves a pay increase for dealing with the hassle.   Speaking of which, that is a very big problem that we, as Americans, are seriously lazy when it comes to getting our reality TV soaked fat asses off the couch and down to the polls, which take all of about 5 minutes. If you are a registered Republican, Independent, Green Party, etc. here in Kentucky it takes you a minute and a half on the primaries, believe me I timed it, and it would have been quicker if it hadn't been for the bitch at the scanner. I know the whole system needs to be over-hauled when it comes to term limits, campaign spending, etc., but let me try to stick with the current rant at hand.   The party with the Jackass as a logo and their rage against good old Ralph Nader. For those of you who didn't know, Ralph fought the big 3(GM, Ford, Chrysler) back when they were probably the biggest lobbyist group in the country and could have you killed for giving them any kind of hastle, let alone the kind Ralph gave them. Nader stood up to them regarding car safety and some other issues. Now Ralph might not have the full deck of cards, but he brings with him and honesty that you should get from an elected official. I have never heard anyone who has ever really known him speak ill of him. I have always heard good things of him as a public servant, notice the word servant and how it mainly applies to us, their bosses now? The Democrats worry Ralphie boy will swing votes, hell if they keep bitching they will give him enough free air time that he could swing a lot of votes from both sides. The Democrats realize that John Kerry has about the personality and the looks of my computer keyboard and makes Al Gore look cooool. That scares them, since many Americans are shallow and would vote for a more physically attractive candidate and worry about their views later. Kennedy versus Nixon in 1964 anyone?   The Democrats are sinking and it is really scaring the holy hell out of the old timers. Their registrations are down in most states i.e. younger voters are registering a different party. People don't associate them like they used to as 'working hard for the American worker, because that's what I am'. They worry that people just view Kerry as the 'Democrat version of Bush', so if things will be the same, why change horses. I could go on and on with reasons, but basically the Democrats worry their 'boy' doesn't have the power, charisma, etc to pull off a head to head battle with George Wubba.   I never remember seeing, but it is possible it happened, this much press after Bush Sr. lost in 1992 regarding Perot. I think the Democrats can't believe that they lost in 2000, that their chance at 16 years in the white house was washed down the toilet to the swamp down in Florida. I guess the Democrats just worry that there could be another 12 years of Republicans at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and that really perturbs them.  The whole political system in this country is really messed up and away from what the founding fathers wanted. I just want more people to vote, then I'll worry about people being more informed when they vote, then I'll have to work on an overhaul. I think having Ralph Nader in the mix is great for this country because it will do what most Americans don't want to THINK! Once Americans do start to think who knows what good things we could do and then shit we could get accomplished.  I am not saying I will vote for Ralph, because I honestly probably won't, but I fully encourage anyone who does want to vote for him to do so. Hell, I'll encourage anyone to vote, even if they do vote for Kerry. People forget that if we don't use stuff the government creeps up and takes it away, so if more and more of us don't vote there could be a day when that trillion dollar monster, which takes up about 2 square miles in between Maryland and Virginia, called our government could take it away.

2865977,indUnk,"       Well hey guys today has been going good so far but I just figured something out today the guy that I really like likes one of my friends!!!!! Now I know I have no chance with him but really all I can say is that I hope she likes him back and that they get a chance to get to know each other more and at one point go out!! I know it would tear my heart apart to see them go out but really I'd rather my friends be happy then me. Yes I know weird concept but if you've been through half the things I've been through you'd understand why I do the things I do. To tell you the truth sometimes I just wonder why I was ever put here on this earth. Why did God put me here to suffer? I don't mean it because of what's happening right now with the guy I like it's just that ever since I was little there was not one day that I went in this house with out crying. There were times when I cried myself to sleep wondering why God had put me through all this misery. But now I know why, one night I asked him to talk to me and really it didn't hit me until I had to help a friend get closer to God, The reason he did that to me was so that I can help people get closer to him and show them that he was the way for everything! I'm not going to lie and say that all my saddness is gone or whatever cause it's not but really all I can do is pray to God and ask him to help me through everything and to give me the strength to carry on with my life. Some of you must think I'm crazying right now for hoping that the guy I like and one of my friends get together really I'm not cause I know that the biggest reward to my life is coming soon and only God can give me this reward! I know God is looking down on me right now and smiling and cheering me on for what I'm doing and I know he see's that I wish them not bad but good and I will get rewarded for that. I know that if they're reading this right now I know that there going to see how much I really care about there happiness I hope that one day they too well do this for me and not turn there backs on me when I need there help! Yes I will always love Josiah! But I cheerish my friends and there friendship more than anything in this world! As long as I have them both as my friend, I will be the luckiest person in the world! I'm not going to lie at all on this page so I'm going to tell the truth right now I do hope and wish that it is just rumors that he doesn't like my friend but if he does then God bless you both and that you 2 may be happy together I will never wish you guys harm in any way. I'm glad that God gave me this way of seeing things really I think this is a blessing sent from up above from the person I love the most God! God has given me this way of seeing things so I can show others that's it better to love one another and wish each the best of luck in all they do instead of wishing them hatred or dispair! I remember the first time I saw Josiah sitting with my brother in church I turned around I looked at him and I don't know what caught my eye the way he smiled or just the way he loved God! I really don't know and I probably won't ever know but God put this feeling in my heart for a reason and I will keep praying that one I would know why this feeling is in my heart. Everytime I see him I seem to get something in the pit of stomache as if Butterflies were just set loose in my stomache and playing a little game of catch. I really do hope that one I will get the chance to get to go out with Josiah and that he sees me for who I am! I know I'm the prettiest girl in this world I'm probably not even pretty at all. But I see myself as a unique person and am proud of what I have become. I look back at things I have done in my life yes I do regret somethings but I know that that's what got me here to be the person that I am today. I have gotten many times from people that I care more about others than myself I have come to realize that now but I don't regret it one bit because I don't need to worry about myself cause while I'm helping my friends there's someone up above sending down some blessing to me and watching over me so that I can keep caring about my friends and not worry about myself. Sometimes at school I will give people money so they can eat lunch while I just sit there and smile and see that I put food in someones mouth that day! it's an amazing feeling to see that I helped someone! Really I would give my life for my friends even for people I don't even know! I thank God for this ability that he has given me to love people with an unconditional love!! I love everyone with all my heart and wish everyone the best and many more! Josiah I will never stop loving you and I will also never stop wishing you good luck and May God Bless you and that he helps you to minister to people through the things you love! He is the Alpha and the Omega the beginning and the end he is the creator of the universe and can do anything he purposes!! He makes no mistakes!! Just have faith he will be there!! GOD BLESS YOU!!          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2857161,indUnk,"   To football for a second....  I'm reading here on ESPN.com how the trade between the Denver Broncos and the Washington Redskins has just been completed.  Denver hands over Clinton Portis for Champ Bailey and a second round pick.  Apparently Portis will now become the highest paid running back EVER!  So let's have a 'unresearched, off the top of my head' gander at the teams, shall we?  We all remember how FRIGGIN' FANTABULOUS Portis was during the regular season and now he's in Washington with the new coach, Joe Gibbs.  For now, Trung Canidate will serve as backup (where he BELONGS!!!) with another fella by the name of Cartwright coming in as the goal-line back.  Wuh oh....did I say 'goal-line' back?  If you are involved in fantasy football then you have just said the following three words:  Crappy Crap Crap!!!  However, I don't think that Gibbs would take Portis out once they get inside the 10 or 20.  Portis has proven himself to be solid inside the red zone (and any other point on the field) so I don't think there's anything to worry about and I'm predicting that Portis will have another solid year....notice the word 'solid'?  I don't see him having any five touchdown games in Washington, at least not this year.  Although, we shouldn't forget that Portis also had 38 catches for 314 yards along with his 1591 yards rushing...an underrated asset for a RB that will certainly interest Joe Gibbs.  But what about the Redskins' passing game?  As we should all know by now, they've recently signed Mark Brunell as their starting QB...a solid pocket passer in a supposed 'protect the QB' system of Joe Gibbs.  They've got solid wide recievers in Laveranues Coles, Rod Gardner and Darnerian McCants so they're not really lacking there.  The HUGE thing that the Redskins need to do (besides introduce Joe Gibbs back into the current day NFL) is focus on that PITIFUL OFFENSIVE LINE!!!  I'm surprised Patrick Ramsey is still alive!  Their defense could use some patchwork as well especially with the loss of Champ Bailey.  Trading away that second pick will probably come back to bite them so they can't look to the draft to solve all of their woes.  I'm not sure about their cap situation but if they have money left they would be wise to snatch any free agent linemen available this offseason.  What about the Broncos?  With Clinton Portis out, I can only assume that the Broncos were damn satisfied with Quentin Griffin.  I was impressed as well when I saw him play; he showed great quickness and some good field vision for a rookie RB.  However, he will need to bulk up a bit since he isn't as powerful a runner as Portis.  This might be a problem since their fullback, Mike Anderson, keeps getting himself suspended for doin' the doobie dance.  As of right now (before the draft and the offseason is over) I'm gonna say that the Broncos' running game will be at best mediocre....nothing that would keep an opposing head coach awake at night.  They've got some decent WR's in Rod Smith, Shannon Sharpe and Ashley Lelie, although the only consistent one among them is Sharpe and he's gettin' up there in the age department.  Sadly, he's their best reciever so don't be surprised if they take a WR early in the draft.  Their defense was pretty solid last season, if I remember correctly, and the new additions (Champ Bailey) will only strengthen it.  Jake, The Mistakey Shaky Snake, is finally able to be a good QB (and a half-mobile one at that!) in the Denver offense but lemme just say this....  Denver, get rid of Ed McCaffrey....he's useless and could drop dead any second.  Barstool out. ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2835695,Education,"       I've learned a lot from the article by Amy Klein. Here's the digest of it. You can prevent sicknesses by reducing your exposure to germs. Follow these tips for healthier, happier you: 1.Wash those hands! Studies show the best way to avoid sickness is frequent and proper hand washing. Always wash your hands before and after thouching 'high-risk' items like doorknob and ATMs. Using lots of soap and water, scrub all surfaces of your hands for at leat 15-20 seconds. And be sure to dry your hand thoroughly after washing! Carry a packet of tissues with you to make sure this is possible. 2.Carry instant sanitizer for times when soap and water arem't available. 3.Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with your bare hands. Most germs enter the body through these places. 4.Don't shake hands with anyone who's sick. 5.Don't share cups, untensils or even towels. 6.Cover your nose and mouth every time you cough or sneeze-with a tissue, if possible! Also use a tissue to wipe your eyes. Pinkeye is surprisingly common and contagious! Trow tissues away in a closed container. Ask those around you to do the same. 7.Make sure your home germ-free. Dishcloths and kitchen sponges are germist surfaces in the home. But simply microwaving these items for two minutes kills the germs. Sinkdrains, faucet handle and doorknob are also notorious for spreading germs. Disinfect these surfaces often. 8.When possible, use public restrooms with no-touch facilities. When these aren't available, try this trick: After washing your hands, turn off the faucet with a paper towel or tissue. Then use it to open the door before throwing it away.

2828231,indUnk,"           I'm a 'Mice and Men' kinda guy, and I'm going to agree with Thomas' 'it's a comfortable read' quote.  It's mostly dialogue and fun, quite frankly.  Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected.  Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military?  Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries.  Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again?  Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq.  Afghanastan was a justified war.  I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade.  What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade.  He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief.  Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected.  I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions.  The more I think about it the sicker I get.  I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit.  Love, Rob  P.S.  I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2828038,indUnk,"           My only suggestion to those who want to 'study' for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time.   I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays.   So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms.  My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word 'object' (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that 'dispute' and 'argue' are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.

The TSMC meeting went well on Wednesday and the main focus was spare parts deliveries and the usual Customer complaints about our Vendors parts quality. The UMC meeting on Thursday was a bit of an eye opener!!!!. The Customer was very cordial however there was some very strong underlying messages of extreme dis-satisfaction. I took multiple actions as the Account team folded and brought nothing to the table. The Customer is making demands that can't be met. It seems that they do not ubderstand technically how our systems operate.  Did manage to get the Customer Acceptance docs signed but this is a small achievement and pales in comparason to the Engineering demands we need to respond to...... I have 2 weeks to present an action plan for 2 key issues and I already know I am fighting a lose lose situation....... watch this space for fireworks and the usual lack of action from our local support in Tainan.

Last time I flew with these guy's it was not all that bad. This time I realised quickly that any weird bump or strange noise resulted in a look of sheer terror on the faces of the very inept flight attendants....

Also, since I'm a Mary Kay consultant (for four years this month, actually), I asked my wonderful husband to create a few links in that honor. One goes straight to my Mary Kay website where you can look around for yourself or for a gift for someone else (male or female) (and Josh, no more joke e-mails), and if you're so inclined, shop online. I've got a full inventory of just about everything you'll find on the website, and am willing to answer questions related to skin care or color cosmetics needs. If you decide to buy something, I can ship it to you. AND, if you buy $20-worth of products or more, you get a free gift! So, take advantage!  Related to the website are links that allow you to e-mail me directly from my blog. One goes to my Mary Kay e-mail address, and the other goes to the e-mail address that Ron and I share.  I've also added a couple of links to sites run by a friend of mine named Katy Towell. She and I graduated from high school together, and somehow she ended up in California doing web design. She has her own business building web sites for people, and she also started a way cool e-zine (online magazine) for women. The main features are about rock stars from the 80s who still seem to have spunk and flair with modern crowds. She tries to publish every month, but it doesn't always happen. That's okay. But when she does publish, I usually know it because I'm her copy editor. Go Katy!  Speaking of copy editing, if you know of anyone who will be needing a copy editor for their newspaper in or around mid-September and they're anywhere near Wichita, Kansas, let me know. I'd love a full-time editing job, but I have to wait until I'm released to go back to work. Stupid feet having to be reconstructed so they don't hurt all the time! Grrrr!! (You'd think that 15 surgeries would be enough, but I had to have two more this summer!)  Okay, I'm super hyper and I think I'd better stop now. So enjoy my new links!    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If self reliance is American literature, what's British literature, or French literature or Russian literature or Chinese literature.  I'm simply curious as to if it's really uniquely American, or more a human concept in our literature.

2798366,indUnk,"             Based on my own beliefs I'm against abortion.  I feel that both the morning after pill and first term abortion are wrong for me.  Adoption can be much better in the long run for the baby and the mother.  Many women who have had abortions say they wish they hadn't.  Abortion is not something you can take back.  Before women choose to have an abortion they should realize and understand its effects on their body.  However, this is America, one of the few places on Earth were people can live freely.  Therefore to deny a person the right to choose what to do with her own body goes against what we as Americans stand for. One issue that really itches me is what role should fathers play in abortion?  In reality it took an man and a woman to make the baby, but the baby only grows inside the woman.  Is abortion a woman's struggle?  Just curious.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

27603,Advertising,"             So John and I made our way over to the AUC campus at 8:45 am. Thats way early, For the record, my vacation has been filled with days where Im getting up really early, which after a night of shooting/partying, is really fun, I must say.  So we get over to AUC to meet with the students. We jump in three separate cars and head over to the outskirts of Heliopolis. The plan is really simple: we head to a meeting point where we will meet with Norhans dad, who will then lead the way over to the construction site. If only simple things could remain simple in Egypt.  So we get to our meeting point to wait for Norhans dad. He gets there, and we begin to follow him. Four cars. Norhans dad is leading the way. Well, our driver (an AUC provided driver) decides to pass Norhans dad. Why? I have no idea. Another AUC driver does the same. Now, John and I are riding in the back seat, talking with Jan, who is riding up front. Were not really paying attention to whats going on  were assuming that our driver can do is prescribed job of following the car in front of him.   So about 25 minutes later, the other AUC driver zips up next to us and flags us down, letting us know that weve passed the exit.  (Mighty considerate of him, to do so  otherwise we might end up all the way in Sharm.) So we need to make a U-turn, which is not as simple as it seems because the highways in Egypt arent designed like they are back in the states. The next exit/U-turn is like 10 miles down the road. So we make the U-turn and come back to another exit about another 5 miles beyond the exit that we missed so we can make another U-turn. We do so, get off on the exit, and then stop. We dont see anybody. So we ask the other driver if he saw where everyone went. He didnt. He just saw the exit that he knew we were supposed to get off on, so he flagged us down. This led to about an hours worth of confusion. We call Norhan, who is with her dad, to see if she can give us directions. She cant, because she has no idea where we are. (Oh yeah, did I mention that streets in certain parts of Egypt dont have names? That makes it way easy to figure out where you are.) So we jumped back on the highway, looking for another exit. We literally drove back and forth (in 10 and 5 mile increments) making u-turn after u-turn, trying to get off on the right exit. So it turns out that after we passed everybody, they passed us again and kept going. So we never passed an exit where they had gotten off. We finally made it to the construction site about and hour later (after one of the girls jumped back on the highway, found us and led us back to the site.) Needless to say, Jan was less than pleased with this whole incident, but John and I (partially because of sleep deprivation) thought it was hysterical.   Filming on the construction site was fun. Lets just say that construction standards in Egypt are just a little different than in the US. The girls had a fun time climbing up an inclined plank (not attached to anything) that led from the ground level to the second floor, where the workers were building part of the second floor foundation. Fortunately, a nice breeze kept us relatively cool  it was probably only 100 degrees, but the wind made it feel a little cooler. The lack of humidity helps. I think by this point, I have grown so completely comfortable with sweating profusely that I dont even notice it. We got some really good shots at the site that I think will help show the girls personality. They really have fun in almost any situation. They dont really complain about anything  they just joke about it.   Afterwards, we went over to a caf/restaurant to get some lunch. I ordered a virgin pina colada in the hopes that it would cool me off. It wasnt too good, but it did cool me off. John and I picked up the lunch tab for the class  we figured it was the least we could do for them for letting us follow them around nonstop for two weeks.   John and I came back to the apartment, where we crashed for a bit. Even though it wasnt sweltering at the job site, the sun does have a way of just draining all your energy. Slept just enough to barely refresh ourselves and then headed back to AUC to film a dance performance by Selma. AUC is hosting a Model Arab League and their opening ceremony features some introductory speeches as well as some performances. Selma danced with two other girls to a traditional Egyptian dance track. Out of the three, she was definitely the best dancer  mainly because her on-stage presence was really strong. She really enjoyed the dance. Afterwards I asked her about it, and she explained that she had been dancing for years, but had to quit because AUC stopped offering dance classes and because she couldnt pursue it professionally.  I had wanted to go to the pyramids by night w/ Nahla, but she cancelled. So I stayed in for a bit, then headed out to Cairo Jazz (where at this point I am definitely a regular) to meet up with Yasmin and her mother for some drinks. We bumped into Shirine from Campus over there  she was hangin out with Ammar, one of the owners. There was a live jazz band playing tonight at Cairo Jazz (obvious, you might think, but it is only the second time Ive heard a jazz act here.) The drummer was absolutely incredible. He had a solo pretty much every song, and he totally deserved it. Really solid performance. John and Yasmin know both the lead guitarist/singer and the bassist, and we chat with them a little bit during one of their breaks. Its really true what everyones told me about Cairo  in the upper class circle, everyone knows each other. This has its benefits and its disadvantages. In a society where external pressure and judgment are ever present, I can see how it can be totally annoying to see the same group of people when you go out. At the same time, I think its pretty cool that you can go anywhere, see someone you know on some level and pick up a conversation from where you left it off last week, last month or even last year.

2740739,Arts,"        KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON'S ASS HAS FINALLY DECIDED TO EAT HER OWN HEAD!!!   You know what the  urlLink EFF  is, right?  It's a non-profit organization dedicated to keeping folks like you and I from getting the screws put to us by such things as the  urlLink RIAA , the legislation and effects of the  urlLink DMCA , and the batshit insanity of the  urlLink US Patriot Act .  They provide a forum and resources for the average joe concerned about these issues to help make their voices heard, and hopefully do something to prevent/fix some of the damage that these bills and agencies are responsible for in society.  They're good folks, and I like them.  Recently, they sent out their newest newsletter, along with an article about the new  urlLink Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act , as well as a prepared letter that you could send to your senatorial representative, in an effort to show your opposition to the proposed increase of obscenity fines based on a completely arbitrary set of guidlines.  My particular senator is  urlLink Kay Bailey Hutchison .  This is her reply:   Thank you for contacting me regarding S. 2056, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2004.  I welcome your thoughts and comments on the issue.   I know this is true, because the letter came scented with  urlLink 'Bijan for Women' , and all the i's were dotted with hearts.   This legislation was introduced by Senator Sam Brownback, on February 9, 2004, to strengthen the  urlLink FCC's  indecency standards and hearing process.  Specifically, it would increase tenfold FCC fines for broadcasts of obscence material to $275,000 per violation.   This is perhaps the most  un -specific statement I've ever seen.  First, what's obscene?  Who decides?  What are the guidlines?  Is it zero-tolerance?  Will it be retroactive?  Of course these questions are not answered in the letter.  These answers have not even been addressed by the FCC themselves.  It's completely open-ended and random.  Second, the Kay Bailey as well as the FCC are using the word 'violation' interchangably with the word 'instance'.  In other words, every instance of an 'obscene broadcast' carries a fine.  For example, during this year's Super Bowl, let's say CBS had 100 affiliates across the country carrying the game.  They had more, but 100 is a nice, easy number to work with.  Once Janet's evil, dirty titty made it's appearance, under these new guidlines, CBS would have stood to lose $27,500,000 in fines because each of these stations carried the broadcast, and of course, the community isn't smart enough to determine their own standards of decency.   The fines would escalate to $375,000 for a second offense and $500,000 for a third.  The bill would also authorize the FCC to revoke a broadcaster's license after three violations and impose fines on individuals in addition to broadcasters.   This is ludicrous.  Letting the FCC levy fines against individual broadcasters is akin to letting air traffic controllers levy fines against airline pilots because they don't like the way they fly their planes.   That's  what the FCC was originally formed to do, basically manage traffic on the airwaves.     I have received thousands of complaints from constituents in recent months about indecent material on radio and television, and I am particularly worried about the impact of such behavior on impressionable children.   What?  If you're so worried about the impressionable children, why don't you sit with them after they watch something like that, and explain it to them?  If they're so impressionable, make sure that  you  make a good impression on them.     Last year, I wrote FCC Chairman Michael Powell expressing my disapproval of his panel's October 2003 ruling that a certain four-letter word is obscene only when used a a verb.   Well, fucking A.  Alright, I'm halfway with the Kay Bailey on this.  That was just weird.  So if someone  is  a fuck, that's okay, but if you fuck someone, that's obscene.  Taste the  urlLink irony ...   Increased fines should send a strong message to the FCC to use its authority to protect our children and to broadcasters to provide more wholseome programming.   The FCC doesn't need another excuse to flex its muscles.  They've got way too much power as it is, and the job they  urlLink should  be doing is going largely ignored.   The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportaion Committee, on which I serve, recently approved S. 2056, and it now awaits consideration by the full Senate.  I support efforts to make broadcasters responsible for their programming and help ensure the appropriatemess of free public broadcasts.  I hope the FCC will harshly sanction and fine those broadcasters which refuse to adhere to Commision standards and make greater efforts to safeguard our youth from indecent programming.   Take a piece of bread.  Spread a little mustard on it, maybe some Miracle Whip if you like.  Now take your favorite lunchmeat (I'm partial to  urlLink baloney  myself), and slap a piece or two on the bread.  Add some cheese if you'd like.  Lettuce?  Sure, why not.  A litte more mustard on another piece of bread, and that goes on top.  Now have a bite.  Chew it up, and swallow.  Continue until the sandwich is gone.  Now your stomach goes to work, the acid inside working to break the sandwich down as the intestinal walls absorb all of the various nutrients and calories.  Some of those calories will be stored as fat, and some will be sent to your muscles.  The muscles will take these calories and convert them to energy.  Use that energy, put those muscles to the test, and get up, walk across the room, and turn the god-damned radio off, you dumb whore.  Did anyone in your office even read my letter?  Did you take more than three seconds to look for any more than the letters FCC and assume that I was too retarded to not change the station?  I don't need you to tell me what I already know.  I need you to listen to your constituents, and do the job you were hired to do.   Should you have complaints or inquiries, you may file them via the FCC's toll-free consumer line at 1-888-225-5322, via e-mail at fccinfo@fcc.gov or the Commission's website at http://www.fcc.gov.   Oh goody!  Just what I always, sort of, not really ever wanted!   I appreciate hearing from you and hope you will not hesitate to keep in touch on any issue of concern to you.   Of course you hope that.  You don't give a  urlLink fat rat's ass  what I think, much less what I write.  So why not send you a letter?

2713315,Communications-Media,"       I never really minded paying bills.  To me, it's kinda like I'm conducting business with various companies on a personal level.  Makes me feel like the entrepreneur of my own life.  Sure, it depleates the revenue (my salary), but that's the whole cost of the creature comforts that befit my home.  Right now, I'm kinda in a bind.  Remember when I wrote about my car accident (going in the ditch)?  Well, that set me back.  See, every 5-6 months there's 3 pay dates for the current month (For example, this year there's 3 of those kind of months: Jan. 2, 16, 30; July. 2, 16, 30; Dec. 3, 17, 31).  Anyway, when those months come along, it's usually time to pay the car insurace bill.  So that 'extra check' pretty much goes into paying for that.  Well, I don't have to draw this one for you.  The $300 sum dollars I spent then was supposed to be the car insurance payment.  Now, I have no reserve fund anymore (read next post for details), so all the money has to be scraped together with money I was going to use in the future.  It's not favorable in the least.  So, that's where I'm at.  I'm gonna weigh my options for a while, then make a decision.  There's 2 choices I can make, neither of them are completely favorable.  I won't share, this my little problem.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2713315,Communications-Media,"       But the night didn't end there (If you're just logging on, read the entry below first, this is the continuation of that story).  When I got back to my apartment, I found I had a call from my mother.  I had asked her to give me a call when a package arrived in the mail.  I had made a deal with a guy to send me some Beavis and Butthead tapes and they were expected in sometime this week.  I decided to get them tonight since I was awake and up.  And this trip was probably the most organized I have ever been in planning my return to B'ville.  I boxed up some stuff I didn't want at my apartment anymore to take back with me.  I then made a list of things I wanted to get while I'm there.  So I left and drove back, I got there and helped my mother move all these boxes upstairs so she can move them easier later in the week.  I then loaded up my car with stuff to move over to the new house.  So I went into the house and unloaded the car right away.  I then went downstairs and found that the electricity was out in one section of the basement.  I think it had something to do with the fact they were remodeling the bathroom.  So I spent about 10 minutes: looking for a fuse box, finding nothing wrong with the fusebox, being thankful I had brought a desk lamp with me in this move transition, and even more thankful I found an extension cord laying about.  So I moved all the stuff into the room and half-assed organized it.  It was darker then I would've preferred, and the lighting was harsh on the eyes, so I did a little work and then went home.  I grabbed my stuff there and returned to Madison.  This may not sound all that interesting, but it was great to me!  Man, and to think earlier this week I was so angry at stuff.

It's a scary concept and the only real way for me to not think about it is to keep myself busy and not in situations that tempt me to spent money.  I've never been without a safety net of cash, which is where the reserve fund would've come in handy.  So now, I sit here without much food in my home.  I have two cans of soda and a half a jug of OJ.  I also have a box of Mac & Cheese, a few packages of Easy Mac & Cheese, Campbell's Chicken Noodle Soup, and less then a dozen bags of Ramen Noodles (beef flavor).  Ah, Ramen Noodles, the poor man's food.  Mac & Chesse is the other poor man's diet, but I live in Wisconsin so it's more a second then a first.  Cheese is god.  Behold, the power of cheese.

In light of my pending move to the Wheat State, I decided that my friends and family would be in dire need of news from my life, and that the best way to communicate these exciting happenings was a blog.

I was just thinking about the stupidest idea I had heard in a long time. Of course comming from Brendan, you would think I would know better than to listen. A purse that has a zipper on both sides so when you loose things in the bottom you just turn it over and open the other side? Hello, things are on the bottom because they are heavy and if you flip the purse over they will fall to the bottom again. Really Brendan, we are glad that you are listening to our concerns but I expect more from you. What happened to the guy who had to hear a name 157 times before he remembered? I think living up at MIT has done something to you. Now going to Arizona. You better find a better girlfriend than Adam to put sunscreen on you. I know he has soft hands but he can't be with you all the time. Maybe that should be the next poll. Who should be subjected to the torture of putting sunscreen on Brendan's back?

2699874,Science,"   I was watching “Just Shoot Me” on TV when my phone rang. It was my mom telling me about a terrible news. My eldest sister got into an accident. She was held up and stabbed ten times. I went cold. I’ve seen this scene before in a movie. I never thought it could happen in real-life….in my life.  I never got along with my eldest sister. At times, I swear I don’t want to see her anymore. You see, she’s adopted. My dad and mom never thought they’d be able to bear children so they adopted my sister after 11 miscarriages. For eight years, she was an only child and was my dad’s apple of the eye. But then two miracles happened to my parents. My mom and dad were blessed with two children at their ripe ages of 38 and 40 respectively. Then, the issue of parentage became something of a problem to my sister. She became insecure and unsure of herself. She would throw tantrums and fought with us and our parents. She would always have this “showdown” (as we call it) with my mom, my second sister and I. But when it comes to my dad, she was different. I guess she was scared to lose my dad’s approval. Through her college days, she struggled with herself and her identity. She spent almost eight years trying to finish a 4-year-course that she said she was forced to take.  Then in 1994, my dad died. I moved to Manila with her. I studied in a university and she worked in a nearby bank. At times, she’d still have her showdowns, this time only with me. I began to believe her and lost the confidence I had. She had this knack of knowing where it really hurts. There were a couple of times that I really wanted to leave her alone and live separately. I remember this one time I didn’t speak to her for 3 months. I rented a place on my own and she had her own place, too. Came Christmas time and we still weren’t talking. Somehow, my mom got us back to talk to each other. Then, we lived together again this time with my second sister. After sometime, she left us again. She had an argument my second sister. She lived by herself for awhile until my mom interfered again. Then, came the third time.  It was last month, almost Christmas time. My mom visited us for the holidays. I can still remember that day. I came home from a busy 24-hr duty. I was so tired that I wanted to sleep. I hurriedly ate my breakfast and asked our cousin to get me water. My eldest sister angrily informed me to get it myself. I ignored her and continued to eat. Then, after I finished my food I went to the ref and saw a bag of chocolates. It was my cousin’s. I asked if I could have some and she said yes, but I saw that it was still unopened. So, I asked my cousin to do the honors of opening it so I could have some. Out of nowhere, my eldest sister shouted and I was shocked that I asked, “What’s your problem?” That further infuriated her… and I shouted back. That started the major showdown which ended up with tears in our eyes (including my mom’s) and with my eldest sister leaving. I’ve said some hurtful stuff. I remember telling her that adopting her was the biggest mistake my parents ever had. I squirm right now just thinking how much it could have hurt her.  After that incident, she stayed somewhere and we didn’t bother to know where. She came home after the holidays and stayed with us during the weekdays. Then, on the weekends, she went somewhere else. I didn’t talk to her or even thought of trying to. I simply wanted her out of my life….and I almost did.  I feel guilty and responsible for what has happened to her. Maybe if I controlled myself, we wouldn’t have fought and she wouldn’t have been in that place at that time. I feel so sorry. I feel terrible. I wish I could have prevented it. But, I guess it’s too late. I have to deal with what’s left for me to do now. I guess I’m still lucky that my sister is still alive and that those evil muggers didn’t stab her where it’s deadly. They say that you realize how important a person to you only when you’ve lost her/him. Thankfully, I’m given a second chance for I haven’t really lost her. Now, I know that I still care for her. After all, she’s my sister.    Comment  ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the Scandinavian derby ended 2-2, it would mean that Italy, always a favorite to win tournaments like Euro 2004, wouldn't be playing in the quarter finals.  Denmark started best, the Swedish midfielders allowed Thomas Gravesen to be a dominant force, and quite fair, the Danes got to the lead after a lovely strike by Tomasson. This woke the Swedes up, playing more consistently on the opponents side but didn't get closer than a header from Mellberg hitting the post.  Sweden received an early penalty in the second half when the Danish goalie Sorenson tripped Henrik Larsson. Larsson scored and the teams played evenly for 20 minutes when Tomasson yet again managed to put the ball to the net. This virtually paralyzed the Swedes and Denmark were closer to get the third than Sweden their second.  But just before full time, in the 89th minute, Sweden scored the equalizer when Mattias Jonsson (who normally plays in the Danish top division) got the chance.

This weekend we're going to go camping with Dave and Alexa, and last night we went over to their house for dinner with another couple. At first, it was kind of silly and funny how Jerm wouldn't stop talking about camping, and it seemed like he was just trying to be prepared. But as Alexa, Dave and I all told him to calm down, we'd take care of everything the next day (all of us are home on Fridays), he got more and more tense and crazy. Finally we had to leave, because he was really anxious about getting all of the stuff together. When we got home, he and I argued about his behavior, and he got all mean and passive aggressive about how 'you said you'd do it all, I'm not going to help you at all.' Finally I just stopped arguing and stopped speaking to him for the rest of the evening. I put some stuff together, then I went to bed.

He couldn't keep himself from adding in one more rude and snotty comment. This morning he was soft and quiet, but I'm still somewhat irritated that he thinks I'm not competent enough to pack and take care of things.

263212,indUnk,"    This Yawn's For You  I was up until about 4 last night.  At 5 there was a phone call.  I woke up twice more in my total 5 hours of sleep.  Since the power went out earlier this week my alarm clock has been messed up so I had to check the time on the computer.  I got up and ready at 9.  I went to chapel at ten.  At 11 I shared lunch with Donna and afterwards we continued studying for the third Old Testament 201 test of the semester.  I skipped my other two classes so we could keep studying.  The test was at 1:30.  I wasn't finished with the discussion questions at the hour's close.  Dr. Lee offered me 15 minutes to finish it.  I wrote and wrote.  I walked it to his office still incomplete.  He insisted that I sit in the next office and finish it.  How gracious!  When I handed it in he asked how I did and said, 'I hope you did well lad.'  He said 'lad', that's just too cool.  He asked me a number of questions about my life and calling, and even who my roommate was and if I got along with him.  He started to feel like another grandfather.  Dr. Richards, my theology and philosophy professor who is now retired, had taken that role in the spring.  Next I walked to the library where Donna was.  I looked for articles for my Old Testament notebook.  She looked for some for her Developmental Psych class.  At 4 we went to the cafeteria porch and waited for dinner.  I was disappointed, at 4:30, to learn that there was no more beef-a-roni.  I settled for corn dogs, yummy.  Church was having a special thanksgiving do so we skipped out on that.  We, now with a friend of Donna's from Tennessee, proceeded to Dothan.  We hit all the high spots of Wal-Mart, Wendy's and Books-A-Million.  In B-A-M I read books on collecting records.  We were all tired on the ride back.  That's why I don't like this season as much, it keeps me tired.  We arrived back on our gorgeous campus grounds at 8:30.  Now here I sit typing.  Suddenly, I'm awake again.  PS- I'm growing a beard. ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
263212,indUnk,"    Where Faithfulness is Most Important  I meant with all my heart that I would blog as prolifically as I ever had before, but I can't do it.  I asked Donna how I used to pull it off, and she said because it was all I did.  In January I rarely even made attempt to write, but this month I've sat staring at this screen daily trying to resolve the issue of what to write.  It's not that I have nothing to say.  Nor is it that I can't disclose the details of my life.  Maybe it really is as simple as this: I do more than blog now.  I'm attempting to be responsible.  At present time I am swamped with work.  I got behind in the first couple weeks and now have made monstrous steps to recover.  I am almost there.  Perhaps when I reach that great mountain top of victory the view will result in much to tell you, and the energy to tell.  Perhaps.  Your comments were encouraging.  Thank you.   A few nights ago as I laid me down to sleep, weary from the day, I wrote in my notebook,  'I absolutely refuse to go on like this.'   I was too tired to pray or even think.  This was my attempt to spend some time with the Father.  And what a weak attempt it was.  I wrote that line looking around my room, cluttered so horribly some would call it trashed.  I thought for a moment and it occured to me this room reflected the way I've been going at life.  I meant what I wrote.  That was probably the most sincere prayer I had prayed in awhile.  I wanted God to change me.  Time and again He's offered redemption and usually I waltz away, but now I absolutely refuse to move save He moves me.  He has been.  I'm not declaring a new repentance, in the sense that I've been completely deaf to His call and totally absent of change.  He's transformed me, especially this past year.  I think repentance is ongoing.  Not to say that we perpetually repent from the same specific sins when in reality we've no heart to change them, but instead that perpetually we are being humbled in light of who He is.    Last night at church I wrote this,   'I need faithfulness, not just to church.  Could this be the year that I begin to show faithfulness?  That would be my resolution: to become so faithful that even I see it and believe.  What have I been doing?  Denying God and floating merrily down the stream.  I go with the flow in the worst way.  One of my favorite questions is, 'What would you change if you could?'  This time last year my answer to that was for Donna and I to be together and in hamony.  (Despite me, God has worked this out and I find our relationship to be more edifying all the time.)  This year my request is to be together and in harmony with Christ.  I've been getting somewhere but all in all it feels like a treadmill.  I've made myself out to be the guy in the ditch from the parable of the good samaritan.  Here I am, all I have is salvation, and yet I lay in the ditch like I got nothing, no one.  This is the great denial.  I'm so fake.  My best attempts to be 'real' consist of me portraying spiritual struggles.  What's more fake than that?  I usually don't struggle.  I give in.  I give up.  That's what I'm good at.'   This morning Dr. Cunningham made yet another convicting point.  He said that if a person is not regularly absorbing the word of God they are susceptible to hidden sins.  This illicits from me response.  I must move.  There must be action.  I have to take this seriously.  Quiet times shouldn't be so quiet and daily devotionals shouldn't serve the mere purpose of showing devotion.  It is essential.    And that's where faithfulness comes in.  I've decided to minimize my internet time down to two hours a day, which is a major decrease.  My time online is my biggest faux paus of time management.  With the extra time I can be more faithful, where faithfulness is most important.  Also, with this addition of hours, I will be reading  urlLink 'The Baker Encyclopedia of Christian Apologetics' .  That's 704 pages of fun and excitement!  Anyway, that's all I got for you now.    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zen speaks like hammer, Mark is but a nail:  'If you mind is torn between two conflicting desires, the contradiction will destroy you mind's unity and tranquility.

Well I suppose sleeping on a rock hard ground after you've been heavily consuming beer, korbel and jagerbombs steady is not the best effort for sleep.  Continuing on to the next day where the kick off of my day is a jack and coke followed by cashing off a bottle of Hurricane between two people and moving onward and upward to more korbel and a few beers thrown in there somewhere....while swigging from a jug of hot sex and taking double gulps of Doctor's as it makes it's way around the campfire.

Well i went to laurens house as i have already written in the blog before and we didnt get to go on our little 'hike' but we sat around smoking cigs. haha we felt so badassed. It was a great moment. Catherines response...'omg how could you guys?!' and 10mins later 'omg i wanna get drunk with you guys!' um hell no.   I read a poem in the school's new literary magaizine today about love. I thought it was 100% correcto. It's by a girl who was on the soccer team with me, Chasity. She isnt someone i would usually hang out with, but that girl wrote a poem that i really liked. It was about how if you love someone, you should tell them. If you dont u may regret it, if you do u'll never regret it. I've thought that for years. A line in it said something about yelling and fighting but still loving. It made me think of aaron. Ive thought a lot about aaron lately, maybe because i feel close to him now, and i never really did. Yeah, that's it..i feel close to him. Hes not much on the outside, but inside we really click. I'm glad we've both grown up and accepted each other for what the other is worth. He gives good hugs too...it's like his hugs arent fake, they're real. i like that. But aaron and i just sit around and talk about immature stuff. we mainly talk about sex. wow..surprised? nope.   Ben and Chris are leaving me.

I know i wont be able to walk up to them and give them a hug and be like CONGRATS!!! *hug kiss hug kiss* because of everyone else around them and their family. I'm actually happy i have to paint as my exam with them this friday for drama. Ben pinched the hell outta my ass today. it hurt! haha i yelled ouch and he laughed and then hugged me, blaming me and chris for loosing his yearbook i never had. ummm...sounds like chris lost it ben. go ask him and stop fussing at me. dammit. i'm gonna miss them a lot.   I went to the dr. today during 2nd period and we supposedly set the date for my knee surgry, my grandfather took me, so i planned the surgry with the doc. I set it for july 7 with pre-op july 6. That is when he told me it would be the best time, because hes going on vacation during the last 2 weeks in july and didnt want to do any surgries the week before he left. i can understand that. So i was like yay i'll have my knee worked on, stay in bed for a week, and still have time to spend with my friends. i came home and told mom i had set it up...she of course said NO JULIA im changing it. ugh why mom oh why?! wanna know why? i found out im literally spending the whole damn summer with my dad. not just a month like i planned. fuck dammit fucmmit. WHY?! the dr. had told me he wanted to do it in july because if he had to do it in aug. it would be the same week school starts...mom said thats fine, i'll just miss the first damn week of school. thats gonna suck. that means im already doomed to take all my fuckin exams next year. FUCK. well maybe not all...but 1st semester is for sure. fuck. i dont want to go fight those stairs with cruthes and shit during school. oh well...i cried and cried, for like 2 hours. I just laid there on my bed with my head in my pillow letting it all out. i thought about calling lauren and crying but knew she was with hollis, so didnt bother. i will later though. i cried because i was going to miss the 1st week of school, that a lot happens that first week. maybe i should be happy i get to miss a week...but you know, that i means i gotta fight with crutches and stuff...i cried about that. I cried that i wouldnt get to see my friends over the summer. i cried telling my mom lauren was going away and i wanted to spend time with her. my mom said 'well laurens not my child' and i said 'i wish i wasnt ur child' through my sobs. Its gonna make me cry just writting about it. ...ok im offically crying now. i cant believe this. all summer with the people who keep me going, who keep me who i am. i'd go insane without them. i would have already moved to live with my dad if it wasnt for them. they dont know that, but its true. I love them with all my heart. they are my life. I can hardly go to the bathroom by myself, how will i spend a whole summer by myself?...i dont know. I guess when im laying in my bed during the first week or so of school lauren will still be in town, and she can come hang out with me and we can spend days together watching tv and me sneeking her pain pills. haha nice thought huh lauren?   Now that i have to accept the fact i wont be home all summer ( im coming back the first of aug.) i have to make something positive out of it. maybe i'll come back totally different. i hope so. Randy told me today i looked like a healthy ashley oslen. haha yea ok, thanks randy, but the lighting must have been pretty damn good. even though it made me feel good.

Had a few hours to kill before Subuh this morning, and decided to go through some stuff that I still keep from my school years. We're moving to a new place at the end of the month, and I'm sorting out some stuff- you know, things to keep etc. Some old pictures from primary school, one of my diaries (I was 10 or 12, and reading it made me cringe..=)..think I'll get rid of it. I'm quite sure my mom has read it somehow) and yearbooks from secondary school. Gile nostalgia..

It can even be categorised as a form of abuse. =) But God, I miss those days. I was in BB till form 3, and decided to go to a boarding school far far away when I was 16. Things were not as exciting at the new school, but looking back, I wouldn't change a thing.

2591513,Student,"           Hallo everyone...  Well today I found out that my little man is going to be speaking at his graduation.  I am so very proud of him.  He has grown into this incredible human being and I am so sure he will do great things in his lifetime, he has already done so many, it is hard to see him stopping.  Then here is my oober goober husband complaining about stuff...haha I love my Edward.  I have decided in the next life I will be a psychologist...haha  I don't know why, but that is what I have decided...random thoughts...  Nalani is sleeping in her bed in our room, my dream is to have a nice job so we can buy a bigger house where my kids can each have their own room.  ED HURRY UP AND BE AN OFFICER!  haha    Well that is all this kookie girl has to say tonight.  Have a great evening.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2591513,Student,"           No dog, the lady never called...oh well...that just means to look for one closer to home and that isn't such a bad thing.  I am a little peeved at people and their priorities...but that is just me.  I am not even going to go into it.  It is life and I am trying not to harbor any ill feelings to anyone...workd for most the time, not to one person in particular, but those of you who read this know my beef with that someone...haha.  And NO that someone is not related to me.  So anyway, today everyone is feeling sick, bad timing with school just starting and all.  I don't want to have to do this semester begging my professors not to drop me.  Although I have already.  I miss my first day of class because my uncle's mother passed away.  I don't want to miss her funeral.  My uncle Mike is a great man and I would like to be there for him and his family.  It is sad.  I know he must be having a hard time.  Lately I have been full of sadness for my husband's friend's passing.  After hearing how he took his life I am brought back to my past and remembering feeling like there was no other alternative but to take your life.  Of course back then it was young adolescent stupidity...but that feeling was so real.  So thinking about how rock bottom he must have felt.  It makes me sad.  I also think heavily about the daughter who will grow up wondering why her father is gone in such a tragic way.  I can't begin to imagine how to help a child go through something as traumatic as that.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2591513,Student,"           I feel so bad...I can't help my sister out, I can't help my mom out...hell I can't even help myself out....please pray that I get thsi job...there is a lot riding on it.  UGH  I am still heated about my cousin...what should I do?  I tried numerous times to talk to him, but he ignores my calls.  Talk about immature...and this fool is nearing his 40's.  You would think that having 4 kids, he would be a little more mature.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2587417,Student,"            Applications made easier...  I love filling out applications, because I have nothing better to do with my time!  I think now I have filled out 8 or 9 apps and got no calls back... I will go insane!  I call back and they always say 'uh... were not hiring now, but we have your app on file if we need you...'  and then give me an excuse not to tell them that they are idiots. But then again, why hire a 15 year old who is still in high school then hire a college student who will only be working for the summer!

2587254,Student,"              3/25/04   Slowly settling back into school time again....   Yup it's been four days.....and I still can't settle back into my schedule before March Break. My brain still seems to think that sleep time is until 2pm......and lunchtime is still around 2pm in my head. So yeah last 4 days.....I've been starving in the middle of either english or programming. Stupid biological clocks........GET IT RIGHT LUNCH IS AT 11AM AT SCHOOL! Yes I realize that my biological clock won't just LISTEN to me but still just getting that comment out (come on...I'll give you a pizza if you listen =P)......no I'm not talking to my stomach I'm talking to my very talkative 'Left Wall Section.' Yeah you can shut up now. That was directed to you....yes you...the reader.  My day started off relatively decent. Last night was the first night I actually got  7 HOURS  of sleep! IT IS POSSIBLE TO SLEEP MORE THAN 5 HOURS. And WOW was it cool.....I actually felt AWAKE for once. Morning went by pretty quickly......got everything done and left the door at about 7:50 or so. Pretty nice looking day today....sun's shining already. A great blessing from the Lord after think it was 4 straight days of rain. Yesterday when I decided to cut across the train tracks to get home.....wow my shoe was actually getting stuck in the mud.....yeah and my Iverson Questions are basically ruined for now. They're old though so I don't really care. So yes.....headed to school like usual.....radio really stunk this morning....every station played the crummiest music I've heard in my life....106.9 I just hate because it's non-stop rap....the crappy kind. I mean I don't mind some (like Nas and such).....but listening to the artists like 50 and Chingy.....random crap about stuff that doesn't even matter....yeah they need a lesson 101 on 'how to rap about stuff people care about.' I mean I like Nas because he actually has stuff to bring out....like how so much in society is poison (his song 'Poison'). IT ACTUALLY SOUNDS COOL BECAUSE THERE'S COOL ISSUES IN IT. I mean HONESTLY why would I give a crap about what a 'wanksta' looks like. Crappiest song ever....besides 'Right Thurr.' *Shudder.*  And at school.... Music class first. We didn't really do much....worked on Gambolier....then we got into little groups like quartets and started playing random songs.....weird.  Oh yeah....and Kiwanis week....I'll be busy...REALLY BUSY. Apparently I'm now part of Senior Band for good, playing in intermediate band, and also Stage Band X. Plus my usual piano repetoire....wow. So much stuff....and so yes that was basically music class summed up right there....  Science.....did some lab w/ people running....I was falling asleep during that time....I'm amazed my marks are still so good even though I sleep during 50% of the classes lol.....I mean I still remember at times in September where I would fall asleep while writing a note......and my note would kinda trail off into '-------------------------------'   Lunch today was different from ordinary. I didn't go eat lunch.....but instead stayed into play some basketball. O M G i'm horrible now. Sunk one from outside perimeter and then another one around the foul line. Wow I really need to start playing again lol. But yeah....played a pick up game sorta thing.....me Jason and Dan were on a team. Boy were we horrible lol. Jason was the most hyper one out of all of us like usual......and I just sucked. Long story short.....I starved for lunch =P.  Bio class........Tehmina and Rachel's group presented their presentation today on 'the respiratory system.' Lots of candy.....basically they killed our group in all aspects. And I've never seen so many overheads in my life. It was REALLY good presentation though.....just the content....and the game afterwards. We won! lol. Mmm........sour gummy bears and gumballs. The  gumballs I shoed 20 in my mouth.....not very smart as up until now my jaw is still numb from chewing the huge piece that was in my mouth. Well combined into one gigantic piece thing.  English...read......and went to Robert's group. John Terry and Adam Crookes are just too friggin' annoying. Nothing against Mike he's cool but the other two....yeah just can't stand them. So I went w/ Katherine, Heather, and Robert now. Robert's alright ever since I got to know him better from working on bio presentation together.....and when u sat beside him in Geo and Bio this year.....yeah you talk a little bit. Heather and Katherine are pretty cool kids too.......both seem pretty obsessive w/ drama though haha. So we started the script.....pretty much debated for 40 minutes what scene to do and whether we should add bullet-time matrix stuff for the sword fight lol. Yeah........and at one point since we figured we were short on actors.....we were planning a teddy bear to play Mercutio lmao. Yeah weird bunch of people....oh yeah and the line that my last group had.... 'Where Romeo at....Dawg?!' honourable mention from teacher haha.  Badminton tryouts today.....I thought I did OK. I still don't get how they decide how good you are from watching you play doubles. Doesn't make any sense. Meh both ways I think I might have made the team.....but then again I think I may have got cut because well the 9ers basically make it on by default for experience, and Pokan plays decent. there's 10 spots. Hermann, Jacob, Brandon, Niner A, Niner B, so basically 5 spots left on the team lol. Well for the guys....I don't know anything about the girls on the team. Too many of them lol. SO yeah that was basically badminton summed up. I hope I make it at least hehe.  Afterwards, walked to bus stop w/ Mike and Dan, and then headed home. Stopped at the park to play ball w/ Dominik and Ryan for a bit. Wow I'm horrible still haha.....plus I was starving lol. So played for about.....20 minutes or so then headed home.  Napped for an hour......thats long story short at home. Drummed for a bit...and now I go eat after this blogging hehe. Yeah I'm on the phone w/ Josh discussing HYPE website so it's kinda hard to think lol. Cya.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I heard somewhere that time is actually speeding up; that a day is literally shorter than a day 100 years ago. Being the hippie I somewhat am, I believe it has to do with mankind destroying the ozone layer, melting the polar ice caps, creating the greenhouse effect, making nuclear power plants, forcing the indians off thier land, destroying the rainforests...and I would not be suprised if Barney 'the purple dinosaur' was involved. Its a conspiracy!  Well.. at least this year I have a party to go to. Last year I was going to have some people come over but I got a headache I didnt want to deal with people. So it was just me, my cat, a bag of potato chips and Carson Daly. And despite your company, Carson, (for you really are a lovely host... one painted pinkie and all...) not being a loser much appeals to me this fine new years day. I will ring in the new year with Dick VanDyke, fake champagne, my friends and maybe a boa or two. And, until a get myself a car and (more importantly) a drivers license, that is the best I can do.  Marissa and I were discussing how old we feel the other day. I know, I know...15? How old can you possible feel? Well.. do you realize that a kid born in 1998 is 5 yrs old now? Yes...Yes... suprise suprise! I can do math. But think about it. In just ten short years I will be 25. Its even hard to believe I will be sixteen this summer. God... I'm getting all sentimental!

Did some searching on the word ' intuition' , this definition strikes me (macam banyak masa kan kat sekolah)...ehheh  ' Intuition is processed unconsciously. As a result, it has been reduced to a myth and allowed to sink into the province of mystics and fringe groups. Nevertheless, the descent of intuition from prehistory as a means of surviving changes and predators and finding ways to deal with enemies ensures that it is still the intelligence of everyday life. Human relationships, especially child-rearing, matching oneself to a mate and a job-these are the chief provinces of intuition. In its wholeness, intuition is the form of intelligence that includes our social sense..'  Basically what Im trying to say here is after yesterday's event,Ive had it until here.

I think that my dream is a fairly simple one. I want to be able to support my baby, and if she wills it, I want to be able to spend the rest of my life with her. I want to be able to put my past experiences to work for my family, I want to be able to teach people from what I've been through in my life (whether insignificant or not), I want my life to be put to use. I want to be able to take my baby to the places I've been and share new experiences with her, I want to go out west again and see everything from a new point of view. Basically, I want to make my baby happy, and if I could do that I wouldn't need to do anything else. I'd rather mean the world to one person than mean everything to the world. If she is happy, then I am happy. And when she isn't happy, I want to be right there with her supporting her, giving her someone to lean on. I suppose it'd sound a little strange to some people to be so wrapped up in one person, but I love her so dearly I can't imagine being anyother way. So whatever my future may hold, as long as it is with my baby, and I can support her and take her out to all the places that mean something to me, I can live with it. If she's not in my future, well, I think I know what I'd do, pretty much the same thigns I plan to do, just X out the Jaime parts and add the word recluse in... But for now I have my Jaime, and thats all that really matters, don't have to worry about a future without her.  Will my dream come true? Well, thats up to my baby...      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2529236,indUnk,"   So, as you probably know, Michael Moore has a controversial new film called 'Fahrenheit 911' coming to theaters at the end of the month.  The film--a critical look at the Bush Administration--has been all over the press because of the controversy surrounding its distribution.  It's no secret the right wing does not want people to see this movie.  In an election year, a movie like this could do infinite damage to the already suffering Bush campaign.  So, its with little surprise, that the Anti-Moore attack from the GOP has begun.   urlLink This seemingly innocuous group called 'Move America Forward'  (how original) is campaigning to boycott any theatre (there are currently over 700) that plans on exhibiting the film.  They blatantly distort facts about the film and Moore himself, claiming the film is 'bashing America' and trying to 'Bring down the government'.  Nothing too surprising, right?

2517532,Education,"         Another term of the  MSU College Bound Program  ended last Saturday.  It was another unforgettable experience (as always).  The  MSU-CBP  is a summer program that serves as the training ground for incoming freshmen students in MSU.  It is a program unique to the Mindanao State University.  Our Pre-University Center Director has described it as 'a special program for special people' because the students are those who were baccalaureate and conditional passers in the MSU-System Admission and Scholarship Examination.  Since last year, we have also opened the program to Special Scholars so that they may not have a very hard time maintaining their scholarship grants.  In the  CBP , we train and prepare students for college.  We review their English and Math and teach them new techniques and lessons.  We also try to inculcate good morals through Values Education.  Basically, the  CBP  is like an extension of high school.  It's really fun for both students and teachers.  I have been with the  CBP  for six years now (I still can't believe it's been that long!).  It is where I learned to appreciate and understand my teachers and their efforts.  It is where I came to see how important teachers are and how tough their job is.  Before my  CBP  experience, not even in my dreams did I have any interest in teaching.  I wanted to be a doctor, a lawyer, a dentist. I wanted to be lots of things, but never a teacher.  I knew that teaching was a low paying job and I thought it was the most boring job in the world, what with all the monotony and the routines.  The only instance I remember about me wanting to be a teacher was when I was in 1st Grade.  I wanted so much to be a teacher because I liked to check the attendance.  My mom and aunts gave me this columnar notebook where I wrote all the names of the people in their office.  Every single day, I'd check their attendance.  But after a while, the excitement wore off and I forgot how I wanted to be a teacher.  It was summer back in 1998 (after my second year in college) when I volunteered for the  CBP .  Because we were student volunteers, we were called 'tutors'.  Our job was to review the day's lessons and make sure that the students understand everything.  Normally, a tutor would be working with one to about three or four students, but ours was different.  We were not really tutors for we were like real teachers.  Our setting was the normal classroom setting.  We had a course syllabus to follow and things like that.  Our job was not only to develop their writing and grammar skills, but their oral skills as well.  We also tried to develop their self-confidence by training them in oration, singing, declamation, etc.  This was my very first 'job' ever.  It was then that I realized that teaching is not as bad I thought it was.  Teaching was actually fun and teachers get to learn so much and get to meet different kinds of people.  After that first summer, I volunteered in the  CBP  every single year until I graduated.  But, it didn't end there for as soon as I graduated, I was taken in as one of the faculty.  Being a regular faculty, a real teacher, was tougher than being just a mere tutor.  But, I realized that the tougher it got, the more I liked it.  It would always make me feel so good when I saw my students get the lesson.  It's always a joy to see those smiles of satisfaction.   'Ah okay!'  and  'Ah, I see!'  would always be music to my ears.  Seeing my students improve satisfies and fulfills me more (much, much more) than seeing my own grades improve.  The feeling that teaching gives me is just indescribable.    Teaching is said to be noblest of jobs.  I, myself, don't really see myself as someone noble or anything, but I know most teachers are.  As for me, as a young teacher, teaching has taught me so much.  It has given me patience, perseverance, contentment and compassion among others.  Teaching, after all, is learning.  It's a wonderful experience.  From the very first moment I stepped inside that classroom and started my lesson, I knew that this was my calling.  From the moment I saw that very first 'nod of comprehension', I just fell in love with teaching.  I may become lots of other things in the future, but I will forever remain to be a teacher.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

250500,Communications-Media,"       Anybody wandering or stumbling along the Shore cannot miss The Floaty Boat. She's battleship grey and looking a bit down on her luck.  What to do with it?  A brief history: Originally a steam yacht owned by the Guinness family (no, really) she was used during the war (second, I think) as a minesweeper round the coast of Blighty. Then she was laid up on the canal linking Loch Ness with the west coast for a long time before arriving in Sunny Leith  under her own power  in 1986. Since then a restaurant business has seen many incarnations, some good, some awful. Laterally, under the guidance of the Fat Controller, there was some considerable success as a party venue, as there is a lot of space inside. During the Tall Ships visit, two youthful pissheads jumped off the Boat to cool off - or somesuch - and of course all on board (and there were several hundred) rushed to the rail to enjoy the spectacle, throw beercans and stuff. This caused the Boat to shift on it's bed of Vauxhall Vivas, shopping trolleys and empties to the point that water arrived through the open porthole (OK, broken porthole) in the Gents, no doubt spoiling one of those perfect moments one has in the Gents for anybody there at the time. A shout from deck - 'God Save The Queens!' Not sure who that refered to.  So, the Boat is indeed afloat, if only just. However, large pumps are constantly pumping the Water of Leith back into itself.  From a quite pleasing black hull, white superstructure, a repaint gave us violent canary yellow. This displeased the local residents, some of whom were on tranquillisers after looking out the window each morning. The fat Controller, possessed of a wry sense of humour, painted it again - battleship grey. (£1.89 a tiny tin from good model shops)  Closed for a few years now, something must be done. Problem: The hull is in very poor condition. Solutions: Fill it with concrete, or repair the hull. Aggro: Repairing the hull requires drydock - not possible (bridge in the way) - or lift the Boat out of the water - not possible as it weighs 400 tons. Aggro 2: Filling it with concrete would require setting the boat on the bottom permanently. This would then attract the council, looking for rates. Yes, at the moment the Boat does not pay rates or harbour dues (the bridge again, which was constructed after the Boat arrived - very inconvenient.)  Little known fact: There is a perfect triple expansion steam engine, Scotch boiler and all the gubbins still installed below decks.  Any ideas?     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2479099,Sports-Recreation,"           Woo! Summer is here! Thank god! Okay, excessive use of exclamation points stops now. I appologize. So sorry. But here's my complaint. I was thinking this might be the only one for the day, but I was wrong, there are at least three.   First complaint: it's in upwards of 90 degrees today. My heat? Is still cranking out hot steamy air. My thermostat is set to the lowest setting (something like 40 degrees), and yet there is still heat coming into my apartment from the boiler in the basement. You'd think the landlords would like to save a little cash and turn that off (or at the very least, turn it down), but nope. It's still running.  Second complaint: The professor I'm working for, Crazy (as she will be referred to from now on), called me while I was working at the country club. Not a problem, really, but what she wanted, was a big problem. Okay when I left her Saturday evening, she said she wanted me to work today. Fine, okay, whatever. So we set up a time to work at 1:00. Well, she called me late last night (11ish? I don't know for sure because I didn't take the message) and said that she didn't need me today. So I made plans for an afternoon of me, myself and I. It involved the beach, the sun, music, and a book. 10:45am at the country club and my cell phone starts ringing and it's Crazy. Crazy wants me to work today afterall and she wants me to work at 11:30. She's made an appointment with someone at a doctors office somewhere and needs me to give her a ride home. Well, first of all, no. I was at work until noon, and I wasn't going to leave to give her a lift. Second of all, no. She told me she didn't need me and I made plans for myself. 45 minutes isn't notice, it's a demand and I am nobody's servant. I don't care if she never wants me to work for her again. I will not be ordered around like a paid driver/maid/butler whenever she wants me to do something. I just won't do it. She was a little ticked when I said no and offered no reason why I couldn't do it after noon instead. Too bad!  Did I mention what she had me doing on Saturday? She had me picking up and sorting her dirty clothes off of her bedroom floor. She had me taking the clothes to the dry cleaner. She had me vaccuming. She had me washing dishes. She had me taking out the trash. She had me taking her to the mall and coming back to get her. The job I applied for was typist. Not personal assistant. I don't like doing most of those jobs at my house, let alone for anyone else. The day before I cleaned her damned refrigerator! And to be honest about it, it was disgusting! There was rotton meat in there. I could not get that smell out of my nose the rest of the day. It was just...disgusting.  Third complaint: Remember in complaint number two when I said I was going to the beach this afternoon? Well, said beach wasn't open. And by open I mean that there was no one there to unlock the gates around it. Yeah, that's right, gates. And you also have to pay a dollar to get in. Sand is rare and precious here in Iowa, and they make you pay to use it. So because the folks at the state park haven't employed anyone to man the gates at the beach, no one gets to use it. How dumb is that? Pretty goddamned dumb.  So, with the whole afternoon to do whatever, what did I do instead, you ask? Well, I came back to my sweltering apartment and decided it was cooler outside (and windier). So I decided the remainder of the afternoon would be spent outside, reguardless of the fact that I had no beach to lay on. I washed my car. I washed my neighbor lady's car (she's a little on the crippled side, and she seems like a sweet lady (she worries about me all the time), so I figured I'd do it while I had the soap and bucket out). I washed my boyfriend's car. I washed my boyfriend's roommate's car. I drew the line there. This was a free service for these people, and others were growing interested, so I stopped there. And it gave me a chance to test-drive the new swimwear I purchased in January (yeah, it's really cheap in January). It's cute, and it's comfortable, and more importantly, it stays in place. Yay, for good swimwear!   So, once all the cars were clean, I took my sorry ass to track practice so coach could run me ragged, since I haven't been doing that on my own these past few weeks (stupid cold and the cough that won't go the hell away). Buck ran the cough nearly out of me. I feel a LOT better. And now I'm back in my swealtering apartment. Holy fucking hell it's like a sauna in here. Breezy, yes, but hotter than hell. I'm a little disappointed with my food selection at the moment as all I have is warm food (or food that tastes best warm). Guess I'll be having ice water for dinner (or supper if you're from Iowa, and damn if I can't break that habbit. it will forever be supper to me) unless mr. lovely brings something home with him. That's doubtful.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2468264,indUnk,"       Well it was one of those days when everything from your past catches up with you. I was 'sitting' in a chatroom, when this voice came over the speakers and stopped my heart cold. I felt the blood drain out of my face as I sat there and listened. It was a voice that should never have been heard again. A few years ago I was in a very intense relationship with a fellow. It was amazing and dangerous. He made me feel things I never thought I would feel. Then, things turned bad and I called the whole thing off. We had planned to be married. That just could not happen. Soooo a few months later I get emails and phone calls from a very good mutual acquaintance. He told me that my ex was dead. He said he had killed himself in a very unpleasant manner and I was mentioned in the note. He let me know what was said, mostly just that it was my fault. Soooo after years of guilt and grieving, I hear his voice issuing from my speakers. Oh yes this was the dead ex I had listened to his voice for years. We talked for hours on line, on the phone, and in person. It was indeed him. I am not sure how to proceed, if indeed I should do anything at all. I have let go of the guilt I had over his 'death'. Perhaps as crazy as he obviously is I should let that dog lay.  On a lighter note, I saw one of my oldest friends from my current chat residence yesterday. It was very good to see him. He championed me early on when I took chat too seriously and too personally. He was one of my bright spots in that place when it was still rather dark for me. He took a 'short' break ... which stretched into a year. I have missed him. And as for his usual roll in my life he did bring a smile to me even when I was sad about some plans that had fallen through. I love those folks who can disappear from your life for a while, then show back up and you can pick up right where you left off. We did just that, like he had been here all the while. He is one of my timeless friends and shall remain so.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Am I worth more than I think I am? Less?  So it's finished: cold and calculated, or just concluded. Simply done. When? how? why do we let outside perception get in the way of what's real and true and sharp? But isn't there a song? 'What's the use of crying?' I'm not even there yet. What's the use of anything more than carrying on, as usual? Maybe strength is all I need--not just now, but always. It's funny...whenever I say my little agnostic prayers to a forgiving God, it's for a lot of different things but always the strength to handle things no matter what happens. And I write it all over the place, too. Just some sort of cure-all for whatever gets in the way. It's a good umbrella wish.  And somehow, someone is working his magic, and it's working on me.  As of now, I have to do Spanish homework and studying, finish math, and somehow balance tutoring with M and meeting with M--what was his last name again? Shoot, and I have to find the address too.  From the metaphysical to the mundane.  Right now I'm considering going to bed and then waking up way early to finish whatever it is I have to do (except that pesky schedule conflict remains unresolved--why couldn't I just realize how important it was to call to tell them that I couldn't tutor anymore in the first place?) I feel bad that M might have to find out too late and just wait around school until 4 or something, but then again M of the E is an adult and an attorney at that, and I'd feel flakier for missing that appointment if it weren't for the fact that M would probably have to wait. And she paid me for this week, too! (for a change!)  No serious piano today, though. :( what the hell, I instinctively did a happy face.

240089,indUnk,"           Rabid Vampire Bats Kill 13 in Brazil  RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil - Rabies spread by vampire bats has claimed 13 lives on an Amazon river island, local media reported Saturday.  The deaths occurred over the past 21 days on Portel Island, according to the O Liberal newspaper. The island is about 1,500 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.  In all, 19 people have been infected with rabies. Of those infected, 13 have died and six remain hospitalized, two of whom were in very critical condition, the newspaper reported.  Since March 9, some 300 people have reported being bitten by the bats, but most of them were vaccinated against rabies, O Liberal reported.  Health officials were working to immunize people and cattle to contain the disease's spread.  About 100 people from around the sparsely populated region are camped out near the municipal health post distributing the vaccine which requires separate doses over five days, O Liberal reported.  The first reported rabies death transmitted via bat bite was of 10-year-old Mailson Moura de Souza, according to the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper.  'My son and my relatives have been finished by this disease. I'm afraid the rest of my family will die as well,' Souza's father was quoted as saying in the newspaper.  Some reports attribute the spike in the number of bat bites to increased deforestation on the island that sits near the mouth of the Amazon river         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Nnnng,' comes the grunt from Mickey, who starts to claim that somebody has stuck his bottom to the floor.

2362981,Consulting,"                  In light of Frank Visser being away and not updating his  website of integral discourse , I thought it important to share Ray Harris' response to Ken Wilber's  recent comments about the site  as soon as possible…I've certainly found it enlightening, and with Ray's permission ' Yes, go ahead. I'm still debating whether to blog or not to blog - it could be a huge diversion, who would read it anyway…?' (good point;) I've included the full text here… It will likely be posted more formally in other locations soon…   WHAT I REALLY MEANT TO SAY WAS..  Some critical observations about Ken's recent suggestions   By Ray Harris April 2004  There was certainly a tone of frustration in Ken's recent post. I can only speak for myself so I can assure Ken the frustration is mutual.   I guess I'm disappointed on two personal fronts.  The first is that in stating that Frank's site is the source 'of the greatest concentration of distortions of my work that I am aware of.' Ken seems to condemn the good work Frank has done to advance integral studies. Frank's site is often the main gateway to Ken's work for many people. The 'Meetup' link has created discussion groups in dozens of cities around the world. The provision of ten language sections makes Ken's work accessible to many people outside the English speaking world. A service that is not offered at Shambhala or the Integral Institute's various sites. Ken might have acknowledged the positive contribution Frank has made.  The second is that Ken adds my name to his list, thus 'tarring' me with the same brush. I will address this issue later.   The Public Domain   In its reaction against religious dogma the modernist revolution made a public virtue of free and fair speech. The modernist revolution helped define the standards of open intellectual discourse. Along with these standards came related rights and responsibilities that applied to 'all' parties. Ken is absolutely right to expect that people quote him correctly and make ethical use of his work. Ken also has the responsibility to do the same with other people's work. One cannot apply certain standards to oneself and then apply different standards to others.  When Ken published his books he put his ideas in the public domain. Sure, the ownership of those ideas are protected by copyright. However, the idea of free speech gave rise to two related concepts and institutions: exceptions to the copyright laws that allow fair quoting for purposes of study and debate and the public lending library, where anyone can access information. Frank's site adheres to this principle and is somewhat like a public library. Why is this important? I'll return to it later.  The problem with Ken is that he tends to play with the conventions of public debate. He has used fiction and journaling to express his ideas and he has published serious 'academic' works as well as populist digests (A Brief History). I have no problem with that. I'm all for creativity. But despite this Ken still has a responsibility to properly present his ideas for open debate.  The frustrating thing for anyone wishing to engage him in critical debate is that he tends to make up the rules as he goes along. For example he has been criticized for his use of notes. I don't know about others but I always thought one should apply the standards written out in the various 'style guides'. I thought notes were designed to convey secondary material and that the substantive argument was to be presented in the body of the text. Yet Ken has sometimes complained that people failed to read the notes where he reveals what he really means.  Ken took his use of notes to another level with 'Boomeritis'. I ran foul of this one. It turns out that the notes are published on the internet, but get this, the book doesn't tell you this, or give you the email address. Occult notes - a new device in serious publishing - sheesh.  Now Ken has pulled another rabbit out of the hat - once you've mastered the notes that contain substantive points and the occult notes that exist on a website (bad luck to those who do not own a computer) - to fully understand Ken you must now be in dialogue with him. Interesting.  Of course I can hear the wails of complaint from those who feel Ken misrepresented their work in SES, TOE or Boomeritis. Was Ken in dialogue with them before he used their work? Of course not - double standards - you bet.  You can imagine my amusement over Ken's use of the example of dialoguing. It was a quote from a private conversation. This was not (it is now) publicly available. This is taking occultism to a new level. What Ken really means is now hidden away in private conversations - sheesh, gimme a break!  The requirement that people be in dialogue places an unreasonable burden on public debate. I would argue that it is Ken's responsibility to publish his work in a way that promotes free and fair debate. In other words, his 'substantive' argument should be accessible by being openly published and unambiguous.  The interesting thing about this dialogue demand is, what happens when Ken takes mahasamadhi and is no longer around to dialogue?   Double Burden   Ken really had me scratching my head on the double burden argument. I mean, I'm no expert on logic but I thought the thing that mattered was the individual proposition, not whether it was put into one or two sentences. Or did Ken mean to say syllogism? If A believes X and B believes Y then X = Y, true or false?  Ken has a point only if he can show that his critics conflate his views with their own. Otherwise X and Y remain separate propositions.   Come on Ken, don't insult the intelligence of your readers. You see, the double burden must apply to your work as well. If you make a false proposition about someone else's work, say in SES, does that make the whole book false and 'virtually worthless'? Clearly not.  The real problem is whether or not Ken's critics have quoted him correctly and/or have excluded substantive material. Mark Edwards can defend himself but from what I've read he usually goes to some length to provide several quotes. Are these selective quotes? In which case Ken should simply provide Mark with the material he missed.  But here we return to the difficulty of Ken defending himself with occult points of clarification - points made privately to a select few. It's hardly sportsman-like old chap! Ummm, X is completely wrong about me because I clarified my position when I was dialoguing with my friend over a glass of wine in my kitchen!   The Tyranny of Distance   Ken has raised this point and it's a good point. In my case I live in Australia and to be in dialogue with Ken has definite limits. I have met Ken (and others - some of my recent material is informed by, you guessed it, dialoguing). I made the journey and he was a delightful and generous host. But there has to be a way around this problem because the integral community is international now. It gives a natural advantage to people who can get to Ken, heck, it even disadvantages people who live on the East Coast of the US.  The other problem is time. I actually think it is perfectly legitimate for Ken to be selective about responding. He can't be all things to all people - there ain't enough time in the day. I personally don't expect him to answer me directly - I know he has considerable demands on his attention.  I just wished he'd used this particular opportunity more constructively.    Who the Hell Am I?   Ken makes some general comments about the double burden, dialoguing, misrepresentation - and then casually throws in my name as if I'm part of the same general problem. It puts me in the same category as 'people who outrageously distort my position'.  Ahem, I'm afraid I kinda, well you know, sorta, respectfully disagree.   For a start most of my writing on Frank's site is quite clearly my own opinion and is not a criticism of Ken's work. No double burden there.   But the interesting thing about those articles which do contain criticisms of Ken is that he has never, ever, not once, said that I have misrepresented him. Well, except once, privately, by email (unless my memory is faulty, which is possible). That particular instance was in fact a dialogue between myself, Ken and Don Beck over my 'Rescuing the Green Meme from Boomeritis' article. This is where I found out about the notes to Boomeritis on the Shambhala website. Now Ken may feel that I have misrepresented him horribly, the trouble is he hasn't shared that with me. I haven't been able to apologize, or correct, or justify, or defend, or squirm out of it, because I haven't been informed.  I reckon it's a bit unfair to be put into this reply of Ken's, as if I'm someone who has distorted his writing, without it ever being shown that I have. Have I?  This is the interesting thing about dialogue - it's two-way. You tell me if I've misunderstood you and I tell you if you've misunderstood me, perhaps we've mutually misunderstood each others misunderstandings. Perhaps I didn't understand that what I said was contradictory and perhaps you didn't understand that what you said was contradictory. So Ken, how can you include me as someone who has misunderstood you without dialoguing with me about it?  Perhaps it's not that I have misunderstood you but that I simply disagree with you on some points, for example, Blair isn't integral he's just a centrist with a good PR machine. Maybe you've just made a bad call on this, and on other issues?  Ken, if you want to be treated fairly you must treat others fairly. And if I have treated you unfairly I'd like to know. At least then I can defend myself or crawl into a hole..otherwise don't imply that I have.  You see, here's the thing. I've only been getting positive feedback. The only person to take issue with me has been Don Beck (I'm green btw, rofl) and you were privy to that exchange. No-one has jumped in to say 'you asshole, you've misrepresented Ken'. So maybe I'm under the delusion that what I've been saying strikes a chord and is appreciated. Maybe more people agree with me than you realize.   The Integral University   I'm actually no stranger to the IU. I might not have dialogued directly with Ken about it but I have dialogued with the folks at Foresight here in Melbourne, the 'futures' faculty, and I have dialogued with Greg Wilpert of the 'politics' faculty. I'm not saying they agree with everything I have said but many of the issues have been discussed and noted. I'm not exactly on the periphery.  But what I want to say goes back to the idea of free speech and the idea of the public library - it's an important idea. The idea was to make knowledge available to those that could not afford to buy books or pay for university degrees, some great people have been self taught, Ken included. I'm guessing however, that if I want to cast my critical eye over the syllabus of the IU then I'll have to pay for the privilege? I hope that the IU casts its net wide and does not become yet another ivory tower. I hope the IU adheres to the well established rules of open inquiry. And I especially hope that the IU doesn't go down the road of conflating the institutional demands of running a liberal academy with running a business, a conflation that is eroding the academic standards of universities around the world.  The advantage of Frank's site is that it is free. And according to the positive feedback I've been getting my message has been getting through to precisely the people I want it to get through to.  You see, many of my posts are actually directed to the 'Integral community' in general. They are critiques of Ken for the consideration of the community. They raise questions and problems designed to get people to look at the issues at a deeper level. If you remember Ken, you once said you provided orienting generalizations - and that others needed to fill out the detail. This is the motivation behind my posts.  And Frank's site offers me the only opportunity to do so.  If integral theory doesn't deal with the questions and problems now then it will have to deal with them later, if not from me, then from others, if Ken doesn't respond, then others will. They are questions on notice.                ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2360457,indUnk,"       More old Hollywood gossip -- I've been busy reading biographies this week.   urlLink Golden Boy: The Untold Story of William Holden  is the only biography of William Holden and it is an incredibly crappy book.  The author writes the biography as if he was there, transcribing the conversations from a variety of Hollywood stars.  After I finished the first chapter, I wanted to return the book to the library, but I decided to carry on to get a quasi-real story about Holden.  And what a sordid story I got.  Basically, he was an alcoholic.  Holden had to drink before he was able to act in movies, and much is made of the couple belts he would take before a scene.  The drinking eventually lead to his downfall -- and actually caused his death.  Holden died from a laceration to his forehead which was caused by hitting his head during a bout of heavy drinking. He apparently remained conscious for half an hour or so after the injury but never realized he should phone for help and died.  The author coyly refers to his reputation as a lady's man, and the affairs he apparently had with his co-stars, but I didn't get many details on many of them.  The most interesting is that he was going to leave his wife for Audrey Hepburn after starring in  urlLink Sabrina .  But she wanted to have kids, and he no longer could have them, thanks to surgery.  (Snip-snip!)    I think I may be a little harsh on the bio -- but seriously, the writing style was awful.  Leonard Maltin sums it up in his  urlLink mini-bio  by saying, 'Bob Thomas' melancholy biography, 'Golden Boy,' revealed that the handsome, self-assured actor so admired by men and women alike onscreen was in fact a man fraught with insecurity who essentially drank himself to an early grave.'

2314011,Student,"             Squishy burned me.  Bad Squishy.  But I feel initiated now, so I forgive Squishy.    Just finished a round of Yoga by twilight; come to really enjoy night practices.  They might make the leap to Moscow with me.  The boy and I are about to finish watching Nurse Betty.  Decided to have a Renee marathon after Cold Mountain.  Am liking Nurse Betty more than Chicago, I have to say.  I've been bitter about that movie since its initial release and have now been vindicated.  Yes, it was well done.  Yes, the actors all performed beautifully.  No, it was not better than Moulin Rouge, which every critic admitted in each review's opening paragraph.  And yet, the truly original, campy masterpiece was the red-headed bastard child of 2002's Oscar ceremony while it's safe, comfortable, more-refined looking younger sister walked away with 2003's Best Picture.  At least Nicole got even.  So it's 2004.  Yay.  Pretty unassuming number, really.  Next year will tear the shit up, I'm sure.  But this just gets to be one of those cute, quiet, standing in the corner, waiting for its moment of brilliance years.  Managed to have a great New Year's Eve.  It's always a question: whether the night will be as spectacular as is fabled (expected) to be.  Started at the third viewing of Return of the King; full circle and all.  Saw Fellowship on the first day of 2002, so it's only fitting that the last chapter be seen the last day of 2003.  Ended up at Charley's where the music was the same and the drinks were still free.  Moving even slower today than the last time we stayed out dancing until 2.  But managed to get pretty for dinner with the Grandparents.    'So what's my story?'  The boy asked around 5.  'Who am I?'  'What do you mean?'  'Well, what topics should I stay away from at dinner?'  'Don't mention you're an artist.'  'Okay.'  'Or that you're in graphic design.'  'Okay.'  'Grandpa will ask you if you're Jewish.'  'And I'll have to say yes.'  'Oh just be yourself, Levi!' Mom yelled from the living room.  'Yea, it'll be fine, honey, really.'  'You think?'  'You're the boyfriend.'  'I guess I should play the part.'  Wonder what they think of their newest Grandson-in-Law-to-be.    He waited until they left before slapping my ass.

2290567,Non-Profit,"       Today I went to see an Off- Off-Broadway show called ‘Cardiac Arrest or Venus on a Half Clam.’ The show was pretty good – it was a one-man show starring a punk-rock drag queen named Taylor Mac. She performed these original songs and brief monologues about jacking off in the morning, gay marriage, hanky codes, sex in the back rooms of bars, and a failed relationship with Dick Cheney. Funny, out there, cool. It was a bit uneven, sure, but nicely done in general.  Afterward, we went to a cool French / Moroccan café called Gitane in SoHo. I had a mint tea and avocado on toast. Yums.  Earlier in the day, we had gone to a street festival hosted by Museo del Barrio and the Museum of the City of New York. Museo is like NY’s Mexic-Arte Museum, but it’s a little more Boricqua-focused. Museo, like Mexic-Arte, is in an old scary building, has very limited gallery space, and seems to get by on limited resources. The show, which was a bunch of 20th century Latin American works on loan from MoMA, was really good. They had Siqueiros, Kahlo, Orozco, O’Gorman, Basquiat, and some really cool Argentine works as well.  The Museum of the City of New York had a bunch of shit, but the best was this exhibition of really amazing photographs of NY street life from the past 50 years.  Last night, Yvette and her boyfriend and I had dinner at a really delicious Thai restaurant called Lime Leaf in Morningside Heights. Watched the Madonna interview on ABC, got psyched about tomorrow night’s show.  Madonna’s show is tomorrow night! I’m beginning to really feel it.  I’m too fucking exhausted to write much more right now. I’m not even going out tonight, I don’t think. But everything has continued to be 100% great.  Still thinking about everything. Yesterday I left a voice mail message which featured me singing at the top of my voice. I hope the boy who received it in Austin enjoyed it. I only have one full day and night left in the city.

2283987,Communications-Media,"       So, the Super Bowl failed to produce a score that had a sum ending in three. However, here are some thoughts that it (and the commercials) did provoke: * Adam Vinateiri, you are one lucky SOB * When Carolina scored to bring the score to 21-16, then went for 2, why did Phil Simms disagree with this? In my book, if you don't convert, there is no difference to being down 4 or 5. But, if you get it there's a huge difference between being down 3 or 4. I think Simms is just jealous b/c the option wasn't around when he played. * While I found Justin and Janet's halftime 'wardrobe malfunction' humorous, the funny factor is amplified by the fact that it was on CBS, the network that pulled 'The Reagans' for being too controversial. * Speaking of the 'malfunction,' CBS said they received a lot of phone calls immediately following the halftime show. Who does that? Do they have CBS' phone number on speed dial? Who says, 'I am so offended by seeing a boob on my TV for a couple seconds, that I'm going to quit watching the  Super Bowl , find the contact information to CBS and voice a complaint! Right now!!!'? Do you really even want these people watching your network? I say you don't. * I had to explain to a co-worker who Justin Timberlake is after he appeared on stage. I believe this is the reason *NSYNC made an appearance in my dream last night. I should call CBS to complain about  that!  * My favorite commercial was the Budweiser ad where the donkey wants to be a Clydsedale. I also thouroughly enjoyed the ad with all the football players singing 'Tomorrow.' Otherwise, I'd say they were sub par. But, I was also watching the game with a lot of chatty Kathies, who were not quiet during commercials. Grrrr.     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only do I look forward to graduation, but I'm also excited about all of the things that I get to do as a senior. Yeah, that's pretty sappy.  My school year came to a close today, as I took my first and last final in Precalc/Trig. Luckily, I pulled through with an A on the test and an A in the class. Along with the A that I got on my chemistry test on Tuesday, I now have a 4.0 GPA for this semester, which was completely unexpected.

2224838,Student,"           I finally finished reading  The Fountainhead  yesterday. It seems that this book was Ayn Rand's first presentation of her original philosophy, known as Objectivism, which created controversy when the book was first published in 1943. I had already read another book by her,  The Anthem , last year after I found it sitting around the house one day. It was short enough that I decided to read it purely out of curiosity. Just as  The Fountainhead , the book dealt with the importance of the individual.    The Fountainhead  is about an architect, Howard Roark, his battle against conventional standards, and his love affair with a woman who struggled to defeat him. Roark is shown as the ideal man because of his talent, courage, and struggle to remain true to himself. He believes that 'individual creators are the fountainhead of civilization.' Every one of the novel's main characters struggles to act independently, and the desire to do so becomes the greatest quality a character can possess. The author basically illustrates that society has a dependent mentality, and individuals must act selfishly in order to be free.   Although I don't agree with some of the ideas that I found in the book, it still makes many great points and forces you to think about how dependent our society can be.

Last night's game between the Philadelphia Flyers and Toronto Maple Leafs concluded in some of the most amazing overtime play that I have ever seen. Although it was only a little over seven minutes long, it was so fast-paced that it didn't matter.  Only seconds before the winning goal was scored, Sami Kapenen of the Flyers was slammed into the boards so hard that it made me forget my own name. The replay of the hit showed just how much he had to struggle to get onto his feet and make it into his team's box. Forty seconds later, the game was over when Jeremy Roenick drove a wicked slapshot straight into the net.   The Flyers' win over the Maple Leafs, and the Sharks' win over the Avalanche last night conclude this round. The next round is the Eastern Conference final between the Flyers and Lightning, and the Western Conference final between the Sharks and Flames.

Plus she sits there and listens to me as I whine about how I hate Jerry but love him and how I get so confused.

And as we got off the phone I said plain as fucking day 'I love you.' and he says 'What did you say?' I go 'NOTHNG NOTHING. I'll see you when I get there for dinner.' and he goes 'OK whatever.' I felt like such a fucking fool. Imean my God, here I am trying to respect our 'friendship' and there i go screaming out 'I love you' because even though I still do I don't let him know that to the full extent because I don't want to run him away. I've made to many mistakes in the relationship we once had and I don't want to do anything to fuck up our friendship.

Woo hoo! Let's all get raging drunk by eight-o-clock so we don't even know what's going on! It was so much fun, that group of girls was Fun to hang out with. I've met the nicest people through Jackie. Anywhey, ummm... where was I? No, I mean last night. I was all over the place. For awhile I was playing pool, and I got good again for a minute. Then I spilled a gallon of beer on my shirt. Ten times. And then, and then, and then!  I can't remember last night. So many people, and most of them I just met so it was a lot of talking. This morning (even right now), there is about twelve pounds of rocks in my head. Breakfast this morning, we went to the Index cafe which is famous for getting shut down every month from the health board. We went in and sat down but when they saw how many people there were, we got called a fire hazard and got moved to the corner. Thank god for breakfast. The food was way shitty - the ketchup was sour (??) and even the OJ tasted funny, but I needed it so bad.   And now I'm home. And, I need a job. The crackhead I was supposed to start working for (tomorrow!) decided that he didn't like that I didn't want to work after 6pm. Even left me a nice (sarcasm), long message on my phone saying how I have the completely wrong attitude and if I don't change how I am my whole life is going to be a disaster. Man, that guy was weird. I'm not even getting into it.  So the hunt continues.   Anyone wanna hire me?         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2219341,Student,           i know you believe that i am not alone.  and maybe im not.  but i still have not met anyone like me.  never.  i know one person who can understand the pain that i feel everyday.  and even she doesnt understand it completely.  can you imagine a massive boulder crushing your chest all day?  not bein able to breath?  not having any relief from it?  it never goes away.  and now imagine living your whole life that way.  every waking moment in pain.  every laugh...every smile...every expression hiding that pain.  that's what everyday is like.  dont try to tell me you understand.  you dont.  and no im not trying to be harsh.  im telling truth.  you cant understand the feeling.  just one day being able to be happy.  do you remember the first time you felt happiness?  i do.  the first time i smiled without that pain.  there are no words to describe that feeling.  nor the emotions.  tears from being so happy.  tears from being free.  it was like i'd been missing out on life for so long.  and finally i could feel what people feel all the time without even noticing it.  and do you know how i discovered this feeling?  how i could be free from all that pain?  she cared.  she listened.  she talked to me.  and maybe for a short time she loved me.  and then i lost that all.  in an instant i lost the shield that hid me from the pain.  and in an instant all of  it was back.  and this time it was so much worse.  i was like a knife had been stabbed through my chest.  and when i talk about this pain i dont mean it figuratively.  thats really what it felt like.  but after her it just all fell apart.  all that control i had over this pain.  it was all gone and that pain attacked so hard.  no mercy at all.  and i fell.  i sunk so low.  and i know you know how low i got.  and thats when someone else showed up.  and she too cared.  and believe it or not she lifted me.  she showed me that it would be ok.  and then even she left.  thats when i realized...only about a few days ago that i cannot rely on people to help me.  as much as i love people they cannot give to me what i can give to them.  people will reject me.  people will hurt me and i cannot control that.  even the people that i love will hurt me...which i've learned the hard way.  i rely on God to ease the pain.  so far he hasnt which must mean that i am meant to bear this.  im not mad because i have to.  only upset.  only because it hurts so bad.  and it wears away at me.  its like having to drag around somethin.  somethin heavy.  but if i must then will bear it.  as i said once...i know that bearing this pain and not giving up takes pain away from people i love.  all those people who would have to bear a pain of sadness if i were to give up in life.  i guess that helps me go through each day.  knowing that by living i am protecting the people i love from a pain.  even if the people i love cause some of my pain.  i dunno...i guess thats just that side of me that thinks that i owe God somethin.  like i feel so guilty that i almost took my life and wasted Jesus's gift.  anyways...this getting waay to personal.  i need to go.    to Drew:  i tried talkin to the only person that could really help me.  she showed me no sympathy or pity and gave me no comfort.  i know you mean well but there are very few people who have ever been able to make me feel better.  thank you though for caring enough about me.  i will be ok.  i will live...         ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2205026,Communications-Media,"             I hate being in limbo! Work is still up in the air, so I have no idea of my future. But I have to plan…  Therefore: I’m announcing my other website:  urlLink www.LindseyRobbins.com   There’s my resume, and a gallery of my work.   If anyone is interested, I will be opening a ‘shop’ to work on graphics: you need a button? Banner? That great picture you took of your sweater needs color correction?  5 $. Almost  anything , 5$. New webring? Need seven or eight graphics for it? Let me know. I do 3D work, web work, photo manipulation, and all sorts of stuff.  Take people out of photos? Sure. Make a picture of you with Orlando Bloom? Fine. De-aging is a specialty of mine. (Who needs plastic surgery?

Email me at  urlLink Lindsey.Robbins@gmail.com   Ok, enough pimping, back to the knitting.  I suck. I’ve started and frogged the Madli's Shawl three times. Then I decide to do a smaller repeat until I get the hang of it… frog, frog, frog.  So then I look around in the IK issue for something simpler.  urlLink Kitten  suggested I try for easy lace, rather than start a whole friggin' shawl. I found the Snuggly Baby Hats by Lora Steil in the back of the issue. One is a faggot and lace  pattern that is only like 17 stitches and 8 rows. I mean, I should be able to do that, right?  Wrong. Frog, frog, frog.  Maybe I’m not cut out for lace. Maybe I need to stick to cables and colorwork, so I can see where I am.  And I think there might be a problem with the chart: (NOTE: this is NOT the pattern, it’s just an example to make my point.) It’s supposed to be seed stitch.  On the open squares you knit on the right side, purl the wrong side. On the filled (dots) squares you purl the right side, knit the wrong side.  CHART:    … am I wrong that that produces ribbing? I tried it a few times and got ribbing every time. Am I an idiot? Or am I reading it wrong? Or what?  Not much progress besides that. Fruit hat 2 isn’t going anywhere. The Sophie bag is languishing in my trunk.  I have been doing stuff. I’m about half way done with the teddybear for Red: she picked out these god awful button eyes that look like quarters. “Like the Irish,”  she said. “Pennies on the eyes.” Ok, they make the white bear look even  more  dead than he already did. It’s a little zombie bear. Maybe I should make it drool, or embroider little flies around its head?     I’ll have a picture of Mr. Bear and Red’s Little Dead Bear next time, I think…  The other thing I’m doing is that I’m learning to play the Fiddle. Went to the THING this weekend and learned a few tunes. Love the fiddle. Love MY fiddle…  Got to go for now.

2194618,indUnk,"        the great remains of a friendship, scarred   today is/was another one of those fairly bleak days where i wandered downtown a lot and dropped off applications and thought about how i used to wish i could stay home/not work during the day because i Missed So Much Of What Goes On in the world. now i realize that very little goes on except people going back and forth from their jobs, and those who don't are unemployed and pathetic like me. the emily visit and concert was fun, but exhausting. don't ask me why, please. and my mother sent along groceries for matthew, a gesture which confused him very much. also sphinx the cat may have leukemia. he sat in matthew's bathtub for 95% of the weekend and did not eat anything and looked at us balefully. and so matthew took him to the vet this morning, and leukemia was one of the scary possibilities (of course i have forgotten all the other possibilities because i am horribly overdramatic). i feel like i could use a good bathtub sit myself.       also, when i got on the bus after handing in job application #43 it was with a group of about 20 eight year old children who apparently had just gone to the museum. one of them sat next to me and asked what my name was, and i got his name, which was diablo or something (i swear to god). he was very cute and small and everything. i go back and forth about kids--i don't know if i want to hate them or join them or save them.       this is the part that disturbs me: as the kids were watching the bus television and yelling out the letters to the word searches and whatnot this commercial came on that strikingly resembled a rap video. i have no idea what it was advertising, but there were cars and guys throwing hand gestures at the camera and girlies dancing around in bikini tops and daisy dukes. and these kids went out of their  minds . they wanted to go to the place that was advertised, even though i am reasonably sure an actual place was not being advertised. and this diablo kid was yelling 'oooooo! look at that GIRL!' and they were talking about the cars and the 'dudes.' i'm sitting there thinking, what the fuck? you are eight. are you really objectifying women at this age? i honestly wanted to corner him and his friends and say 'look. women like this aren't real. you are going to grow up with horribly distorted perceptions of wealth and relationships and value shallow measures of success and YOU NEED TO STOP LOOKING NOW GO READ A BOOK. FUCKING PLAY KICKBALL.  HAVE A CHILDHOOD. JESUS.' of course i did not say this because swearing at children is bad. i know that kids today are a lot more aware of these things than i ever was but it doesn't make it right that they're showing this shit on the BUS. nor that they responded so eagerly to it, even though that was the advertisement's point. it made me really, really, inexplicably sad. it was a conscious flash of a thought that existed as well, that i want to go and counteract this somehow.       the problem with me is that i don't  know  how. nor anything else about what i want to do with my life.      and the valentine's day problem has a solution now. i have a plan. i am plotting. be very afraid    (matthew).

2173787,Student,"       So tonight was awesome.  For once I did not feel like an outsider at a school function.  Apathy has a lot to do with it.  Since there are only two weeks left I don't feel the need to fight so hard to fit into my little spot.  Instead I was able to let loose and dance, albeit poorly.  My life is changing.  For once I can feel it.  In a way its kind of like special relativity, even though I'm always moving forward I don't feel it unless the process accelerates or decelerates.  Right now I'm accelerating. In a way my life feels a lot like driving home tonight.  The windows were down, it was dark and the music was blaring.  But with all of those distractions I still felt one with the car, one with the road.  There is no greater feeling than driving fast on dark windy roads.   It makes me feel simultaneously in control and out of control.  And that's what life feels like right now, a dark windy road.  Yet while I'm ready to press down the accelerator and see where this road leads I can't help but look in the rear-view mirror wistfully at what I'm leaving behind.  So, I'm off to bed to dream happy dreams and do some serious thinking about which road to take at the next intersection that comes my way.   One more thing...Assertiveness is a good thing.

216413,Law,"       my trusty old telly died yesterday.  yesterday being the day before the airing of the  urlLink season finale for buffy season 6  round here today. yes!  urlLink buffy!  essential television! absolutely essential television! i can barely live with missing an episode every once in a while, but not a season finale. yeah, i know what will happen, i know there will be the thread of yet another apocalypse, yeah spike will get a soul, yeah, yeah, yeah. but still. it's buffy! it's important!  my telly had been acting up this past week, making loud, aggressive  'phrewwwt'  like sounds when turning him on, a strange, burning plastic smell emerging, the image fluttering, at random, moving stripes disturbing my enjoyment of  urlLink the talented mr.ripley  sunday night.  he hadn't been in good condition for ages anyway. the remote broke years ago (i think shortly after his 10th birthday), and the replacement i bought worked in regards to changing channels and volume, but not in regards to reconfiguring channels. the buttons on the actual telly got all jammed sometime over the past two years or so, too. the connection plug for the cable had broken at the same time as the remote: the cable had to be supported by a book put up against it at all times - otherwise the cable just slipped out.  yesterday afternoon, when i turned my beloved little telly on to check whether george w. had already started bombing iraq, he uttered a final angry  'phrewwwwwwwwt'  (longer than ever before), threw out more smoke than ever before, flickered violently - and was dead. my knowledge on the internal setup of televisions is rather limited, so i have no idea what exactly happened and what gave him the final blow, but considering his medical history and the fact he didn't respond at all anymore, i decided even attempting to resuscitate him would be neither affordable nor actually make a lot of sense.  so i bought a  urlLink cheap little no-name telly  that i still couldn't really afford. but he's purty. he's shiny and silver. he doesn't smell like burning plastic. he doesn't flicker. he has got telly text. i can finally watch all 34 channels available via cable here (yay! two shopping channels! three french channels! a turkish sports channel!)  but best of all, i doubt there will be any terrible surprises and spontaenous implosions tonight after 21:15, when it counts. :)         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2162182,Communications-Media,"        urlLink Email   urlLink     Alright, this is not something I usually care about, and Christ knows one of my least favorite things on the planet is Soulless Celebrity Gossip (TM).  But this isn't really gossip, it's just a statement of fact, and frankly, I think somebody needs to f*cking say something.  In the last few weeks, two of the bigger stars in Hollywood have had babies.  Helen Hunt had hers today, a girl, and named her Makena'lei Gordon.  Makena'lei.  Gordon.  The first name is that of a town in Maui.  The middle is that of her father.  All of this is bad.  But not near as bad as...  Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin (who, in case you've been living under a rock for the last five years, is the lead singer of Coldplay) had a baby girl.  Apparently, both in a fit of Post-Natal Depression or suffering from severe PTSD, they named her Apple*.  Apple*.  That's not a typo.  Apple*.  Can we make this stop?  Someone should start a service for wayward artists and other lightheaded peoples of the world to counsel and, if necessary, shoot them when they fabricate and/or allow ridiculous names for their children.  I mean, don't you hate it when people name their kids after fruit?  Hey, I'm the last person in the world to stifle creativity, but come the f*ck on; if we're talking about your kids, who clearly have no say in the matter, how about you make a decision based on their best interests rather than your drug-induced impulses?  F*ck it, I'll start the service myself, set up right here in Hollywood, and make millions.  I'll call it Disassociative Nomenclature Services (TM).  If you know someone who's thinking about laying a f*cked-up name on their unborn child, let us know.  If you know someone who says, 'Oh, we're going to wait until the baby is born and decide in the birthing room,' call us f*cking immediately.  These people are prone to wild fits of pseudo-euphoria and end up naming their kids Ja'QuanDanian, La'Erique, Rumer, Scout, and Bjardkir.  Case in point, File # A.1: there was a guy who (at least in recent years) played basketball for Pitt and then for the Golden State Warriors.  His name?  Vonteego Cummings.  Von.  Tee.  Go.  His mother  told ESPN on a nationally televised broadcast  how she came up with the name.  Vonteego was born at home, and his aunt (the midwife), looked out his front window immediately following the labor.  In the neighbors driveway sat two cars: a Volkswagon and a Monteego.  Vonteego.  SHE ACTUALLY ADMITTED THIS ON ESPN!  I mean...are you serious?  Case File # A.2: In second grade there was a kid in my class named Geoff Letcher (good name).  His older brother?  Fletcher.  Fletcher f*cking Letcher.  Swear to God.  I could help these people.  We could help these people.  It's so simple.  A concerned friend brings the person to our offices.  A conversation as such follows:  DNS: What can we do for you? CRAZY: Well, my friend brought me here. DNS: Yes.  Tell me, are you about to have a child? CRAZY: As a matter of fact, yes. DNS: And what are you planning to name this child? CRAZY: Dweezil. DNS: No.  You are naming this child Thomas and you will report to thrice-weekly counseling for a period of one year.  We will then execute a contract wherein the friend to the party (heretoafter referred to as 'The Client') in question will sign a waiver allowing Disassociative Nomenclature Services (TM) to murder the client(s) if he/she/they proceed in naming said child something out of reasonable human context or fail to complete their requisite counseling sessions.  This can work, I'm telling you.  Possible exception: you can prove your last name is Costanza and you want to name your first born son 'Seven'.  * - Denotes the fact that, in case you were wondering, this is not a typo.

2161822,Student,"       I feel bad for Thanksgiving. I mean, as soon as the holiday is over everyone forgets about it and sets their minds on Christmas. Thanksgiving is important too you know. It um.. uh.. well,.. we wouldn't celebrate it for nothing. After all, even when Christmas is done and over with, we're still in the 'Christmas holiday' for at least a good 2 weeks. Man Thanksgiving really gets the short end of the stick. So, what else happened over the weekend. Friday night was ... interesting. I'll refrain from going into much detail to keep from insulting some people. Saturday morning was a waste. Eat, watch TV, sit here on computer...blah blah blah. Saturday night though, my family went shopping in Wilksbarre. Can't miss those holiday sales. 'We came here to shop shop shop until the stores close.' Well. This should be    hell. Shopping is pointless unless you walk into a store alredy knowing what you want. But enough complaining. Today is my little cousin's birthday. I don't know what to say about that.

2157212,Publishing,"       Hm... I'm thinking it may be coming to that time again where I need to reformat my hard drive. I'm not looking forward to reinstalling everything again, but I've been having all kinds of problems lately, from CD burning taking 50% longer than it should to disk space magically dissapearing to random crashes. A bunch of annoying crap like that. I'm thinking I might enlarge my system partition... for some reason Windows gradually fills much more space than it should. That'll require wiping off another partition so I can allocate more space to the C drive, but that shouldn't be too hard, just annoying.  I spent most of the day watching the commentary tracks on the Firefly DVDs. Lots of insightful stuff on there... and a fair amount of Nathan Fillion talking about all the times he split his pants. There was a whole lot of depth of thought put into that show. Of course, watching those episodes again renews my anger at Fox for canceling such a great show after only half a season. Stupid bastards canceled the best thing in science fiction since Star Trek TNG... hell, it may even have been better than TNG, considering the dialogue in Firefly blows it out of the water. I'm still hoping for the movie to get made.  And of course it's Christmas Eve today. Merry commercialism to you all, and a happy fiscal new year.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2155904,Student,"       Yep, Wednesdays rule.  Nobody can deny that.  They are that little spark in the week that keep the populace coming.  Tyke really needs that little perking up in the middle of the week.  And today did that for him.  Classes were short and sweet.  Semi-sweet.  Kinda bittersweet at times, like the chocolate.  The majority of his time was spent talking as usual so he stayed somewhat entertained.  And Mrs. Dyke-Bitch pretty much told everyone that she was a skanky-ho and that when she went to college she 'found boys.'  But you all know what that means.  Ewwww by the way.  If you don't know who she is then you are lucky cuz after knowing her you would not want to think this way about her.  And Tyke really hates that he is thinking about it now but he has to so as to please the crowd.  Also in english he let Purdy have another one of his mixes he made in the past.  It's fun to have other people tell him they like the songs he puts on mixes.  So now he is going to make another version for Dotti as he is sure that she will want it too.  And Purdy wants him to put all his good songs on her MP3 player sometime so he will.  Music is a huge part of his life.  He is always listening to music and it really amplifies his moods.  It can also sway his moods but he doesn't do that to himself anymore.  He only listens to music that provides the same mood as what he is feeling at that time.  If that makes any sense.  If it doesn't then just disregard.  Right now Tyke is watching the Real World.  He hasn't ever really liked the show but he still watches it.  It is kind of interesting but in a weird way.  He really doesn't like mean people.  So he always likes watching the nice people on shows like this.  Cuz he sympathizes with them.  After school today Tyke went over to Macaroon's with Fejj and later Amed.  They played some hoops to start out with and that was fun.  Except for one part.  Which was funny but not fun for Tyke.  He had been getting great vertical on his leaps and was getting his entire hand easily into the hoop so he thought maybe he could dunk.  So he took the ball and started to go and jumped off of one foot but at the same time he sorta slipped with his other foot.  So he jumped and fell all at the same time.  It seemed like it was slow motion and he thought he had an easy opportunity to correct himself and land without hurting himself but that sure as hell didn't happen.  He fell on his left elbow (one with screw in it), left hip (not the one that got hit with the ball bearing), and his hands.  All hurt but it wasn't too bad.  More of an hilarious stunt that should have been videotaped.  It would be a classic.  Oh yeah, he missed the dunk...The crew went inside Macaroon's and hung out for a while.  Then Skippy came over and they decided to play some more bball.  It was fun.  Tyke is feeling good about his matchup on Friday.  He thinks he can really have his game escalate to the level he needs to win.  They probably will lose but whatever.  It will be a grand ole time.  Tyke is now really hoping that at some time he will be able to dunk.  He is pretty close he thinks.  The big problem is that even if he can jump high enough he doesn't really have big enough hands to dunk most balls.  So it would be a two hand slam.  And it would be weak.  Whatever though.  Tonight was another lax night for Tyke.  Since there were no events going on he stayed home and just chilled.  He'll prolly do his only homework, math, during the OC so that is good.  And Tyke got an urge to vacuum today too.  He vacuumed the downstairs and even his bathroom.  That is much easier than sweeping.  Try it sometime.  But since Tyke's house is the party house he wants to keep it somewhat clean.  Especially when he has lady friends over...whenever that may be.  He has people over to his house pretty much every weekend.  Like almost literally every weekend people come over to his house.  It has never been much of a problem and he has liked it but lately he wants to do something else.  Or at least have new people over.  The guys just are playing video games together all the time and then occasionally some Chinko.  Tyke wants to play some board games he just realized.  Yeahhh...board games.  Real fun times.  Maybe he will do that after the girls game Friday.  Some board games and Chinko and videotape watching/making.  If not watching, then making.  Nonetheless Tyke decided that Friday nights are the best nights of the week.  Saturday nights aren't as good cuz the next day is Sunday and people are busier on Saturdays than Fridays in many cases.  So...thats about it.  Hope you likey.  Byey.  Fer Fer is out.  And so is Tyke.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2155904,Student,"       Sunday Sunday.  Today was another bland day until about 7:15.  Tyke got some mail yesterday and he opened it today and apparently he was picked to be a rep for prom tuxes.  So that's pretty sick.  Cuz now he can get his for pretty cheap.  So if you want a discount on your tux come to Tyke and he will hook you up.  Don't go to anybody else once reading this.  Tyke now has to be your pick.  So Tyke is really getting no work done right now.  Which is a usual occurrence for him.  He should really be working on his physics paper, or at least just finishing up the blog, but instead he is just chatting away online.  Yeah, time to finish this up.  Tyke has sorta worked on his physics paper all day, but not really.  He spent a lot of time downloading 80s songs as he is making another mix of a decade.  He's probably gonna redo the 90s cd just cuz it was a haphazard attempt last time.  Refuge was good tonight.  The student story was poignant and the rest of it was a lot of fun.  Tyke was in a really good mood.  Probably because the car ride over got him pumped cuz Dotti and Purdy and Tina were all peppy and fun.  On the car ride back Tyke stuck his whole head out the window and at first it was scary cuz it was like a roller coaster.  He just looked straight outside and it was scary.  Scary.  Then he got used to it and it wasn't scary.  Yeah, this blog is pointless.  But today was pretty good.  And tomorrow will hopefully be a fantastic weather day.  That always softens the blow of Monday blues.  Gotta love it.  Tyke that is.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

215223,indUnk,"              Doing What We Can  I just got back from downtown.  Jon Jordan and I made about 50 sandwiches of all kinds.  It was almost an impossible task since no grocery store in midtown has bread.  No bread.  We don't know if it's because people are stocking up at home or if everyone was making sandwiches, but not a single loaf of any kind of bread on any shelf in any grocery store in midtown.  All I'm saying is, whoever ends up with the sandwiches that Jon Jordan and I made got top quality rolls and designer bread.  But then, they deserve it.  I grabbed my big bag of clothes, and we headed to the Javits Center.  First stop, drop off my used clothes.  I actually expected them to take them and toss them to the side.  Far from it.  They asked what I had and they ripped into the bag immediately, yelling the contents and sorting them into boxes that quickly got moved to trucks.  I can't tell you how pleased I was that my clothes were going to be of help right away.   That done, we walked over to the river to walk down to Chelsea Piers.  Chelsea Piers has been set up as a triage center.  As we walked down, we could see that the most recent building collapses had sent more dust and smoke into the air and the wind was now moving some of that smoke uptown.  The core of the smoke remained over lower Manhattan, though.  On the walk down, we passed a lot of military personnel guarding building and street entrances, all heavily armed.  Chilling to think all those rifles and machine guns were loaded.  When we got to the Piers we learned that they were overloaded with food and water and volunteers, but they told us that supplies were desperately needed downtown, mostly at a fire station at Varrick and North Moore Streets.  So we started walking down.  Chelsea Piers is at 23rd Street and the Hudson.  North Moore Street is in Tribeca (the TRIangle BElow CAnal Street...i.e., waaaay downtown).  We would've taken a cab, but there haven't been too many.  Plus, no cab would be allowed below 14th Street, where the City's been sealed off.  We weren't sure we'd be allowed through, since we didn't have any identification showing we belonged there,  but we hoped our food credentials would get us past.  All along 14th Street there are blue police barricades set up.  We approached an officer, told him our story, he checked our drivers' licenses and looked through our bags and let us by.  We were in the Forbidden Zone.  Far fewer people, far fewer cars.  More restaurants open, and many, many more handwritten signs.  Signs directing people to blood banks, signs announcing prayer vigils, signs asking for donations of tshirts, toothbrushes, etc. for workers who haven't been home in 24 hours.  There's a distinct burning smell down there and the dust in the air began to get very thick.  A lot of people were wearing surgical masks or other types of homemade masks to keep the dust and, we now know, asbestos particles, out of their mouths.  We walked with our shirts over our mouths for a bit, but it got to be too much.  I'm still coughing a bit and my eyes are sore.  We walked down Hudson as far as we could, I guess it was about Vandaam, and we were redirected to Varrick Street.  At Varrick we told the officer where we had been sent by Chelsea Piers and they told us we'd need to go to Pier 40 to drop off our supplies.  I have to say, New York's Finest were nothing but.  And as exasperated as I'd normally be, I wasn't bothered.  We had something that we needed to do and we'd go wherever we needed to, to do it.  The closer we got to the West Side Highway, the more people there were.  The highway was lined with people some with flags, some just watching.  But the minute a fleet of rescue workers came rolling by everyone on the sidelines errupted into applause and cheers.  Some rushed out to the cars with bottles of water and sandwiches and energy bars.  The workers in the trucks looked so tired and sad, but grateful for our cheers.  I'll never forget how proud I was to be a New Yorker, standing there supporting those people who've been literally sifting through this nightmare.  We crossed the highway over to Pier 40 where another distribution and volunteer center has been set up.  We couldn't get too close, more barricades, but one rescue worker with a Parks Department shirt on, came out and took our bags and was very thankful.  We don't know who'll end up with our food, but I hope they know that two little guys in midtown are grateful for what they're doing.  After dropping off our bags, Jon was tired.  We had, after all walked over 50 blocks.  I wasn't ready to go home yet, so I put him in a cab and told him I'd call him later.  I started walking uptown.  I wanted to go to Chelsea and see what my people were doing.  Earlier, our mayor had said we should all go outside, try to resume our lives, eat in restaurants, shop.  He didn't have to tell Chelsea twice.  But it was different, dampened.  And there was a spontaneous sidewalk vigil.  All along Eighth Avenue, leaning against buildings, sitting together on the curb, were people with candles.  It was touching.  Not a big deal, just a sign to the world that we were out of our houses and unafraid.  Again, I was proud.  Every restaurant was open, all of them full.  People exchanging information, chatting quietly.  Around 18th Street, a really cute guy caught my eye.  He smiled as we passed.  I looked back and he looked back and stopped.  But I just couldn't talk to him.  I cry at the drop of a hat.  I don't feel particularly attractive or sexual.  As lonely as I feel right now, it wasn't the moment to meet someone new.  That's probably weird, but I have such a sense of loss and mourning that I just turned around and kept walking.  Maybe I'll run into him again sometime.  I kept walking uptown, but started to get tired and needed to see (and feed) Dex, so I hopped in a cab.  At 40th Street we were diverted again, because Port Authority Bus Terminal was barricaded by police.  The cab driver and I took it in stride and took the detour.  At home, Dex was thrilled to see me.  I could smell the dust in the air, hear sirens down the street, there were 8 new messages on my machine.  It's still a war zone.  We're all still shell-shocked.  But we're surviving.  To all of you in other parts of the country, you have to know this:  your thoughts and concern and messages and calls and emails help us feel that we're not alone.  It keeps us from being so afraid.  They mean more to us than you can imagine and we, well I, thank you with all my heart.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2147592,Student,"       Hey. Todays been cool. Frankie got me in the morning, we walked to school, it was um... fun! First lesson was science in the i.t rooms, I was getting incredibly stressed because my email system went skitzipoos... Second lesson was r.e, Alex is so incredibly scared of me! But it was fun, scaring him I mean... At break I went with Letty for a fag, we were with Deesray and stuff. Miss Armstrong came up to us and was just like watching us, WEIRDO? Third lesson was maths, pretty poopy, Clur nicked a poster DuDhI thing, tithe, we were  having such amazing conversations with Mr Thorpe, he kicks ass! Anyway...  Fourth lesson was food, we were in the i.t rooms, I managed to sort out my email thing, Sammy has also just told me that he's changed all the names of my folders, how delightful??? Or not... At lunch we went up Safeways and got in poopy because we always leave the table in a mess. So we did a decent thing and cleared our table, it was great, I also told the lady person it, she was good. Last lesson was history, I now have a detention at lunch, having to look after the year 8s. The test was called: 'I'm scared of year 8s so I actually did my history homework' test... I have to do it, mangaging only to get 3 questions of the 10 right, Clur is with me though, she only got 5 :D.  We came home, cooked some  unsatisfying   (as in burnt and pink inside) turkey burger things, and chips that tasted like fish... We then recorded ourselves dancing to muse, Clur doing this weird stair thing in my kitchen, also the elevator, canoe, superman, super-superfast superman and escalators... We went to Jax, they were doing all this skitzipoos stuff, Clur wrote it in her blog. Clur:  READ IT . Me and Nippsipoos had this conversation about how both our lives didn't have anything to do with anything! Complicated... That's about it. Clur's staying tonight and I think she's starting to get ever so bored watching me write this, so bye  Clur: 2 rite, i wanna go home!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Anyway...

2140839,Marketing,"                  Sunrise, Sunset   My honey (as my co-worker R calls him to my dismay) is back, but he's going away again this summer. This time for three months to Wisconsin for a photojournalism internship. He wants me to drive out there with him. It will take us five days and we will stay in motels of my choice. I'm looking forward to the roadtrip but wonder what will happen when he's gone that long. A month wasn't bad, but three might be a bit much, no? And then I think, who knows if we'll even be together by that time, anyway.   It was awkward for a few minutes when he came over, us relating as bf/gf, more solemn and timid than we used to as friends. I tried not to make fun of him as much, seeing as he's more sensitive about it now and he refrained from doing anything asshole-esque. He laughed at my idea of us spending stupid Valentine's Day at home watching tv as 'letting the romance die too soon'. But I'm vehemently opposed to getting a mud bath, so we'll have to compromise somewhere in the middle.  He lost some weight and got darker. When I hug him, my small arms go all the way around his waist. He brought me trinkets from San Salvador and Antigua and agreed to get a donkey for the Grand Canyon trip. I gave him a book that he doesn't already have (which I purchased with the Stacey's gift card I found on the street) and I am almost done with his scarf. I looked at his photostory of the family who lives in a cemetery and told him of my recent visits to the factory. It's been 14 whole hours and we haven't fought once.

Two years ago, when I started feelin lonely around the fall season, it was replaced by the warmth, good cheer, and mulled wine of Christmastime. But this year, ladies and germs, Halloween's back on top! #1!   Everyone in the office is being ridiculous and goofy and having a good time. I received lots of compliments on my costume. Most people were like 'Ew, gross: Bloody baby!' but a handful, mostly programmers, took one look and were like, 'Alright... Kuato!' During the pizza party in the staff room the CEO announced all the winners of the costume contest and I won 'Most Disturbing'. Before I went up to collect my prize, I performed 'The Birth of Kuato' for everyone. This is where George, Kuato's host, faces a wall, makes some orgasmic gasping sounds, then turns around to reveal Kuato. It went well and afterwards all these boys asked for my number...   When people have dogs or babies, it gives people a reason to socialize and interact. This theory apparently also goes for bloody baby parts glued to an old sweatshirt.

2134154,Arts,"       This is my first post in a while, and I intend to make it a good one. Or at very least a long one. We’ll see how it goes. Actually this post is pretty much going to be a White House Press Briefing.   -It’s amazing that since Sophia quit, she’s said more on the outside than she ever did as a Blogger. Not that I don’t want her to come back, I’m just saying. -Okay, Thomas made a hilarious gaffe today. It’s number five on the list of hilarious puns Hilarious Gaffes and Typos 1. “I hate him with the power of a thousand flaming nuns!” – Someone at TwoP 2. “I’m too busty to get a job!” – Jonah 3. “I’m feeding my dick!” – Ashley  4. “Red Roof Inns don’t have Colonial Breakfast!” – Thomas 5. 'Is that a homo?' - Tim on seeing a homeless person in Chicago.  Okay, so I've seen The Terminal, which was good, and I saw Shrek 2, which was more jokes than story this time, so it was almost but not quite as good as the first. I was saddened to hear that Jonah is staying in Marching Band, although I'm happy that he got a kick-ass deal to do it.   I also, in the spirit of giving, have new stuff for everyone including myself. I got The Simpsons Season Four on DVD, and TiVo for my dad for fathers day, and Presents for pretty much everyone else (blog-wise anyway)  Also my Cousin (and her boyfriend) are in town, and we're showing them the 'Best of Indiana', which is roughly equivelent to 'The Most Mediocre of Anywhere Else.' However, due to some odd reason, neither of them have seen any of the Lord of the Rings movies, so we're giving them a crash course in Tolkien while they're here. Just our gift to them.

2128831,Student,"               'Home is behind The world ahead And there are many paths to tread Through shadow To the edge of night Until the stars are all alight Mist and shadow Cloud and shape   Hope shall fail All shall fade'         On a completely unrelated topic, (no, really- Goths do not really want to hang themselves), some new and obviously very controversial study was published by some guy – whose name I don’t remember –who claims that suicide can be positively correlated with intelligence — in other words, the smarter people are, the more likely they are to kill themselves. Whenever something like that surfaces, I can’t help but feel mildly offended, being still alive and all. Anyway! It would explain why geniuses often end up offing themselves, and I ‘m not planning on it. Much. But I digress.       So. that guy argues that the higher rate of Western suicide could be because people are, on average, more intelligent in the Western world. He’s compared national IQ levels with suicide rates. And the thing is, wherever you look, and whatever the culture, the same pattern can be seen: in Azerbaijan, Greece, Kuwait and Chile there are lower average IQ levels and lower suicide rates; in Austria, Korea, Singapore and Norway there are higher average IQ levels and higher suicide rates. He claims that for suicide to take place, a certain threshold of intelligence must be crossed.       I say, balls, yes you need some balls. First of all, writers, psychologists and philosophers have long argued over the reasons for suicide. The problem is that statistics on the subject are notoriously slippery. Take seasonal variations. I’ll bet anything that more people will feel the attraction of the six-storey building on a cold February morning in Hull than on a sunny August day in, let’s say, Cannes. Winter blues, climate and light and all that. Apparently suicidal thoughts reach a peak in January (when the Samaritans get most calls).       Yet in the West the peak months for actual suicide attempts are, universally, April, May and June. Yeah, I had a boifriend who, in April, illustrated that data pretty well. Also, most sociologists have argued that high suicide rates are caused by modern Western life — that something in urbanized, industrialized society alienates us from friends, faith and family, the mainstays of human happiness. Ok, fine. I’d give faith a beyond-the-religious definition. So, I’m tempted to add that it’s not intelligence but self-awareness that, in my mind, pushes someone to suicide. Self-awareness, which comes, often but not always, with education – of which intelligence is only a corollary. The more educated we are, the more able to see just how crap it all is? What about the dissatisfaction growing into despair at the constantly growing gap between what we have and what we want, in a world when the condition to happiness is to be just about everything the media we created throw at us?  Well this is not very clever; I just got myself all depressed now.   The Bible contains six admonishments to homosexuals, and 362 to heterosexuals. This doesn't mean God doesn't love heterosexuals, it's just that they need more supervision.    You know when you hear something that you find astonishing, but then when you think about it for a while you wonder whether it’s really obvious and that you have just been a bit dense? A recent example of this in my life is the realization that the pub in Eastenders is called the Queen Victoria and it’s in (Prince) Albert Square. Wow! On a wider scale my mate Dave never noticed that it is ladies who have boobs and men who generally don’t. (He’s looked a right twat wearing a bra for the last 2 years.)  The point of the story, I was flabbergasted to learn over the weekend that it isn’t just a tiger’s fur that is striped – their actual skin is striped too! (Does everyone know that??) Tigers have evolved to be naturally camouflaged, enhancing their chances of survival. Genius. Their prey does not see them coming, so they have a better chance of getting hold of some lunch. Hunters and their (few) predators have enough hassle finding them.  That got me thinking about how shit us humans are. Why don’t Aboriginals in the Australian outback develop skin the colour of the scrublands to blend in? Why don’t bee-keepers develop tough sting-proof skin? Why don’t cyclists develop glow-in-the-dark skin and extra hard heads?  I can only conclude that humans are not only rubbish, we’re endangered.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2123946,indUnk,"                 OK, so I was offered the job at Friar Tuck.  In under 10 minutes.  Like, I got out of my car at 5:19, and was back in my car at 5:28.  Good sign?  Bad sign?  To me it reeks of desperation - 'oh, you have a pulse and can lift 50 pounds? you're hired!' - but then what do I know.  I was asked few if any of the usual questions - why do you want to work here - what's your work experience like - tell me what you liked/didn't like about X job - literally within four minutes of me sitting down, he had offered me the job.  So yay, good for me, right?  I told him I wanted to think about it - told him about my concerns with my car - and he said I should call him back by this morning and let him know.  But do I really want this job?  There are some pluses - great discount on liquor, decent hours - and some minuses, namely that I'm not sure I want to work there in the first place, and I don't want to have to rely on my unreliable car.  Besides, I'm a little weirded out by the speed of this whole process.   AND  then last night I got an email from  urlLink Aroma  saying they would get ahold of me this week to set up an interview.  And I'd  so  much rather work at  urlLink Aroma  - it's closer to home, I really like it there, it's more the sort of job I'm looking for, I wouldn't have to go out and buy more clothes.  So do I take the job? Do I take the job and quit if  urlLink Aroma  offers me a job as well? Do I turn the job down cos I feel downright weird about all this? Do I just get my head out of my arse?

I've been reading  urlLink this terrific blog  for the last 45 minutes or so - then clicked over to see her wedding photos and was immediately put off of her.  Why?  Because she bears a stunning resemblence to someone that, while I care deeply about her, on occasion makes my skin crawl.  Is that awful?  I'm still reading and still enjoying - but somehow it isn't the same.  Working til 7 tonight - bummer.  Only 2 more Saturday weeks to go though.  Why did I agree to do them?  Oh yeah, because I'm nice and I know that my not-boss goes through hell doing the schedule each month.  Yes, I know, it's her job - but I can still be compassionate, can't I?  I suppose that my niceness renders me unable to complain - but hey, this is my blog, isn't it?  Thinking of starting a sub-blog for things just for me (and those smart enough to find it).  There are things in my head that I need to get out - and I'm not dedicated enough to put it on paper.  Game night tonight.  I'm looking forward to it and wishing more people were coming - but I guess that's what happens when you plan things at the last moment for a gorgeous Friday night.  We were going to have soup and sandwiches - and now it's so warm.  I hope people still eat the soup!!  We watched the wedding video this week.  It was both funny and sad and difficult.  Our friend Mike made the tape - disc, actually - and you can tell it's a home job and that he had loads of other things to do.  You can't see me for at least half the vid - and then you can, and I'm just stunning, if I do say so myself.  I'm awfully glad we have it.  The difficult part came at the difficult part of the ceremony - the 'forsaking all others' line.  I didn't mean for that to be there.  If I'd been thinking - if it had even occured to me - that line wouldn't have been there.  Watching the video you can see me crying through the vows - and then we get to that line and I about choked.  You can see a tear flying off my face - and me looking at Eva.  I shouldn't have said it.  That was never part of the deal - not from the first year of our relationship on.  I worry that those words which I didn't mean and should never have said sully the rest of the vows which I very much did mean.

Yeah, I finally got fed up with waiting and called Ohio State this afternoon.  They told me, in no uncertain terms, that I was not accepted.  That just really sorta takes the cake, y'know?  Funny thing is, I'm not really upset right now.  I don't feel sorry for myself.  I'm not mad, not sad, nothing.  I mostly just feel...empty, numb, distant.  Like this is all happening to someone else, and I'm just watching from the outside, a passive viewer, a spectator in my own life.  I'm sure this'll change in the next day or two, but for now, I don't feel anything about it.  I don't really want anyone's pity or sympathy, either.  I've already had my fill of it from my parents and grandmother.  It's not that I don't appreciate their comfort or their love, just that...I don't want to think about it right now.  Not at all.  It frustrates me more than I can possibly express using words, but right now, I'm gonna ignore it.  Like I said, I don't feel sorry for myself, I don't feel cheated, I don't feel that I could have done any better than I did, or done things any different than I did.  Mostly, I just feel defeated.  Something else will come up, I'm sure--but for right now, at this moment, I'm not thinking about any of that.  ~chuck  Song of the Moment: U2, 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For'         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2117806,Student,"              'We're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat'   I don't usually do two postings a day, but the past few minutes have been amusing, so I thought I'd share.  See, I'm the only one here at work right now.  Everyone else has gone home for the day in the Writing Center.  We'll get a couple more people to relieve me at 7:00, but from 4:00 until 7:00, I'm basically in charge of the place.  So when I first got in, there was a paper waiting for me to read.  Business/English paper of some sort, I wasn't really sure.  I'm a little tired today, and I didn't get a nap this afternoon, so most things are kinda blurry right now.  Anyway, I looked at the paper and did my thing, then decided to lay my head down for a minute because I'm so damn tired.  Well, I happened to snap back to full wakefulness right before a girl walked in with another paper to proofread (this one's a thirty page Business paper...I'm letting someone else do that one, I already looked at a 15 page Business paper earlier today, and I still haven't recovered).  So I went back to full alertfulness to help her out, just as a  huge group  of prospective students walked into our center, led by one of my boss's supervisors.  When I say 'huge,' I mean like twenty people.  This room wasn't designed for twenty people to be milling around.  It was barely designed for a half dozen to mill around.  Needless to say, it was a good thing the other student came in right before that, or I wouldn't have been awake when this tour group came by, and I'd probably be getting fired about now.  I'm wide awake now, and kinda bored.  Wish I'd thought to bring some research along with me...though knowing me, I'd have fallen asleep doing research instead.  Caffine just ain't doin' it anymore, folks, I need to start getting energy the natural way--sleeping.  ~chaos cricket  Song of the Moment: Electric Light Orchestra, 'Easy Money'         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2086988,Student,"       Well what can we say about yesterday! Hahhahaha it was OSOME!!! Here's a tip when painting someone's room...make sure that the windows are open and DON'T SHUT THE DOOR! lol, me and Em did that, and omg, we were so freaking messed up. We didn't realize anything until we all just started randomly laughing. I was like Kiera, when you paint you need to open windows...plus it didn't help that we just began sniffing the paint cans, lol, then we went and jumped on the trampoline haha, that's so safe, especially when you are like particially high...look at my flip!!! BAM!! You're supposed to stay on the trampoline, lol. Then a few more sniffs later, me and Kiera went to starbucks and hung out. All in all, the day was pretty eventful. I found out something that Kiera did last weekend. I know she did it for me, but I'm still embarrassed about it. Though it really shows how much she cares about me, so Kiera, I LOVE YOU!! Though I really wished David would of told me that Kiera imed him. I didn't find out until yesterday when I was at her house and we opened her log manager and I found the convo and read it. You know I'm really glad when it takes my best friend yelling at my boyfriend to actually get him to IM me. It made me realize that when he imed me last saturday, when I was so upset, that Kiera made him do it, he didn't do it himself...and I saw something he said to Kiera that I seriously thought we were passed. It was about the whole caring part in our relationship, and yea he's told me this before, but I thought we talked it out and everything was ok...But I'm not going to dwell on what happened last week, what's the point? It doesn't change anything...things were said and done and nothing can be taken back, so whatever.

2061087,indUnk,"       What many people don't know or don't remember is that Dolly's hit 'I Will Always Love You' is not the kind of love song that it has been made out to be.  Sure, it's a somewhat generic tune regarding love and moving on; but, she wrote it when she made the decision to end her long-time singing partnership with Porter Waggoner.  To me it evokes the epitome of love and friendship, the generosity of giving your friend what they need (while it may not be what either one of you WANTS).  Life works that way on occasion.  While you may love someone (a friend, a lover, even a family member), sometimes it just isn't meant to be.  And what good are hard feelings?   It's difficult to not have them, but when you stop and think about it, isn't it better to wish someone the best?  If you truly love that person, that is what you want for them.  And sometimes it isn't you.  I Will Always Love You  Dolly Parton   If I should stay,  I would only be in your way.  So I'll go, but I know  I'll think of you ev'ry step of the way.   And I will always love you.  I will always love you.  You, my darling you. Hmm.   Bittersweet memories  that is all I'm taking with me.  So, goodbye. Please, don't cry.  We both know I'm not what you, you need.   And I will always love you.  I will always love you.   (Instrumental solo)   I hope life treats you kind  And I hope you have all you've dreamed of.  And I wish to you, joy and happiness.  But above all this, I wish you love.   And I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I will always love you.  I, I will always love you.   You, darling, I love you.  Ooh, I'll always, I'll always love you.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

2059313,Student,"             Actual Date:  Monday, November 10, 2003  Actual Time:  12:45am  My friend called me a couple of times today.  I missed her call.  I miss her.  She sounded half-way between good and not-good.  When I say that, I mean I think she was trying to sound brave so I don’t worry about her too much.  My phone dies after two phone calls here where I’m working.  I’m in the mountains and signal is kind of a hit or miss situation.  Man, when I heard her voice, it was SO awesome.  I couldn’t help but smile, even though I’m worried about her.  So, now, I’m sitting here, watching Friends, thinking of my friend, and writing in my blog (which won’t be published until I can get a hold of an internet connection).  I hate being away during this time.  Let me clarify… I’m not having a bad time here at all… I just really miss my chosen family, and my church family… and my best friend.  I missed it especially yesterday… I didn’t get to go to church.  Wow.  I really love church, and I love going to church, it’s not a chore like it used to be for me when I was growing up.   1:10am  I feel like I’m running away.  I feel like I had a break-through with a past feeling (or lack thereof) and now I’m nowhere near anyone who I feel comfortable with to help me or talk about it.  I don’t want to bother a particular friend, because they are going through a rough time right now.  I feel like I’m back-peddling.  I’ve come so far with my emotions and with myself and how I feel, that I don’t want to mess any of that stuff up… and I don’t want to disappoint anyone by backsliding and slipping.  I’m a very happy person right now, and I don’t want to ruin it.  I may be sounding like a I’m speaking a bunch of non-sense, but this stuff is all kind of jumbled in my head.  Anyway, I need to sleep.  Hopefully, I will.   9:45pm  Went to see Brother Bear tonight.  I enjoyed it, but it was lacking.  When the movie was over, I didn’t feel like anything happened, it felt a lot like an extended music video for three or four Phil Collins songs… with the some comic relief Moose plopped in.  Disney is starting to reach… and they’ve used their same formula for way too long.  At least this one wasn’t a tired love story where boy meets girl, but girl doesn’t like boy, or is out of reach of boy, or is evil.  Then girl meets boy and falls for him, but then something happens to make one of them think wrongly of the other… yadda yadda yadda.  It wasn’t a complete waste of an hour an a half, but I’d wait for it to come out on video, if I were you.   9:55pm  Friend… where are you?  I’m using my powers of telepathy to urge you to call me.

Apparently, some guys from Northumbria, UK are coming over to check the facilities and the programmes here. He's one of the main guys of this School of Engineering, so.. he has to be present. Btw, this semiconductor class is the most hardest subject this semester. Thankfully, the others are reasonably easy.  Driving today just improved. More lancar now. I'm hopeful that by this coming Saturday, I will be allowed to drive to Church for the youth meeting :P woot woot.  Tests are coming up. We're almost approaching the middle of the term. Wow, time flies.  I'm very happy because the blog at  urlLink BMBC Youth  is doing great. We have Jason, Daniel and Vivien on board now, so.. I'm anticipating an active blog like  urlLink these girls . Maybe by the end of the month, we should have about 10 bloggers. Wheeee!!!  In other news, I'll be going mountain climbing (more like a hill) with Aunt Lily tomorrow morning. Class tomorrow only begins at 2pm, so that's good. We'll wake up at 6:30 and be there by 7:30am. Its gonna be a good exercise as the last time I remebered exercising was....  Anyhow, life has been great as usual. College friends are great, and I've grown closer to a few. Basically, with that, I can get and offer help whenever necessary. Its good to build a network of study partners. Meanwhile, I need to work on my internet addiction. I think I spend close to 20 hours a week surfing the internet and on other net related activities (chat, surf, mail, blog, website management). Hope to cut that down before the exams.

2002478,Science,"       Guess who's printed off about 90 Orders Of Service, byatch! So fucking tiring and mindnumbingly dull, because my printer is having issues and I didn't trust it to print a big pile of card without jamming our destroying the paper, so I handfed the paper to it.   Though, I did get to watch Minority Report again while doing it, so no problems there, except of course, the last two minutes. Speilberg is getting a problem with how to finish a film - see A.I. which could have finished half an hour earlier without all those alien/robots who can resurrect his mummy for one day (which pisses me off even more when they cut out a whole sub-story with Daveigh Chase as a robot girl to fit in that garbage). Minority Report rules right until the bad guy dies (The power of Christ compels me not to say who the bad guy is, in case you haven't watched it) and then you have the bullshit happy ending, with Cruise and his pregnant wife and Samantha Morton living in a cottage full of books and sweaters. It could still have been redeemed with one line right at the end - 'last year, there where over a hundred murders' - which would have added to the whole ambiguity of the story.  Anyway, the wedding is coming along nicely now - just have to sort out the ushers and best man's plans for Saturday morning and write a speech.  =  One month away from being an uncle now. My neice is still kicking and punching Jo's stomach to the point that you can make out body parts. Yesterday she made a move and I could make the outline of the individual fingers of her fist! Ew.  =  England not shit! Look like the diamond formation is dead. Nice to know that Heskey, in about 50 caps, has scored the same number of goals as Wayne Rooney and less than Darius Vassell.  Also learnt on Saturday night, watching The Greatest England XI on Channel 4, that Phil Neal, who played at right back, has scored the same number of goals as Emile, in about the same number of caps. The greatest England team, as voted by the same people who think Diana is one of the Greatest Britons and The Vicar Of Dibley is one of the Greatest British Sitcoms:  GK: Banks  LB: Pearce CB: Moore CB: Adams RB: Cohen  LM: Finney CM: Charlton CM: Gascoigne RM: Beckham (with 43% of the vote, 1% more than Stanley Matthews)  CF: Lineker CF: Shearer  The right-back was the hardest, mainly because we've never had an outstanding player in that position. Gary Neville made the top 3 shortlist, for fuck's sake!  And back to the real world, Leeds are making their first steps into the transfer market. We may have three signings by the end of the week:  *Jermaine Wright, Ipswich. (Bosman) *Steven McPhee, Port Vale, (Bos. Tribunal)  27 goals last year   and, er...  *DEANO!, West Ham (Bosman)  Also on the Bosman, we might be getting the calming influence of Danny Tiatto, Barry Hayles, Julian Joachim and Paul Butler. Who is a defender. From Wolves.   As for leaving Leeds in the near future, Dom Matteo may be off to Fulham or Man City. And finally, Fat Marco might be going. To Juventus. To replace David Trezeguet.   Mark Viduka to go to Juventus to replace Trezeguet.  It's apparently between Marco and Christian Vieri!

2001656,Science,"   Both Sides Now Lyrics by Joni Mitchell      Bows and flows of angel hair and ice cream castles in the air   And feather canyons everywhere, i've looked at cloud that way.   But now they only block the sun, they rain and snow on everyone.   So many things i would have done but clouds got in my way.      I've looked at clouds from both sides now,   From up and down, and still somehow   It's cloud illusions i recall.   I really don't know clouds at all.      Moons and junes and ferris wheels, the dizzy dancing way you feel   As every fairy tale comes real; i've looked at love that way.   But now it's just another show. you leave 'em laughing when you go   And if you care, don't let them know, don't give yourself away.      I've looked at love from both sides now,   From give and take, and still somehow   It's love's illusions i recall.   I really don't know love at all.      Tears and fears and feeling proud to say 'i love you' right out loud,   Dreams and schemes and circus crowds, i've looked at life that way.   But now old friends are acting strange, they shake their heads, they say   I've changed.   Something's lost but something's gained in living every day.

I had a pretty good thanksgiving I guess, fairly normal for the most part.  I don't know what it is but I just don't seem to enjoy going home that much anymore, I guess I have finally realized that I have my own life and going home is not really going home anymore, I would rather be here in Stillwater, it just feels better.  You know I have been debating whether or not to go ahead and take the LSAT (the exam to get into law school for those of you who are not familiar), but I just don't know really what I want to do.  I have been in school for so long I am just looking for the quickest way out I guess.  I could get through law school in about 3 years at the most, and a PHD would take another 4 or 5 so I am just not sure.  I mean I really love philosophy and to have a career in it would be nice, but I don't know if that is the best option right now.  Law would of course be a good career and I think I could use all of my philosophy training, so my entire life up untill this point would not be a complete waste I guess, but still it seems that if I do law then some of it would have been without much use.  Also there is this conflicting issue that I have been so much against xistians being involved in the government and I know that many times law leads to government jobs, so I am just a little confused.  I know that it doesn't necessarily lead to that but it can and I am not really sure how I feel about that.  I think also is the idea that I could be financially stable for one time in my life, I know that is not supposed to be the deciding factor of life decisions but I think it has to be at least brought up, because of the way america works right now.  As much as we might not like it that is how it works, and I guess we have to realize that. (That is the pragmatist coming out in me) I have talked to a number of people about law school and they all say it sucks badly, but I really think I could get through it, I mean writing 30 page papers in every class for the last 5 or 6 years hasn't been the most enjoyable time of my life.

Sallie McFague's Speaking in Parables - as published by SCM in 2002&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink     In 'Speaking in Parables', McFague lays out an approach for intermediary or parabolic theology: theology which relies on various literary forms – parables, stories, poems, confessions – as a way from religious experience to systematic theology. McFague brings a commitment to bringing the Word to life for ordinary people, grounded in a existential, personal and sensuous reflection on life.  McFague refers often to poetry (Gerard Manley Hopkins), stories (Tolkien) and parables (such as those written by Kavka).   McFague reminds the theologian that metaphor and symbol should be used as food for thought – contemplated, probed, reflected upon, rather than manipulated, translated and reduced. Theologians, she says, need to learn to express insights in autobiography as much as in systematic propositions.   urlLink Speaking in Parables  has recently been republished by SCM, 2002, but the 1975 version is also available online at Religion Online:  urlLink Speaking in Parables: A Study in Metaphor and Theology: Online   McFague's later books include:  urlLink Metaphorical Theology: Models of God  (1997),  urlLink The Body of God: An Ecological Theology  (1993), and  urlLink Super, Natural Christians: How we should love nature  (1997).

1970293,Technology,"       They reached Hewten Mountain located in the middle of the mountain range. Trellian landed in the large compound beside the entrance.   'I'll be back in a little while.' Bardric said as he jumped off. He scurried inside.  Hewten Mountain housed the largest library in all the lands. It also housed the largest art collection featuring the best pieces from each race. The library was carved completely from stone with pillars holding up the ceiling through out the inside of the complex. It was considered the dwarves greatest masterpiece.   Bardric noticed that there weren't many wizards about but that didn't really matter. He immediately went to the book of requests and questions. It was proper protocol to sign in with name and reason for being in Hewten along with the date. He glanced through the pages after writing his information. He noticed a few wizards had looked up information on the Drakken. Three to be exact. He knew two of the wizards but the third, he never met before. The two he knew were very recent with one two days ago and the other yesterday. The third visited a month ago which would be along the same timeline as the Drakken leaving their country.

He hurried out of town before anyone took a special interest in his activities and followed. He called for the dragon as he entered the meadow.   Trellian landed a few minutes later. 'So did you find what you were looking for here?'  'I am not sure. The barkeeper I spoke to told me about some rumors of Drakken and some guards from Zorlock and something about the elves and dwarves raising arms but he didn't specify against whom. There are a lot of empty houses in town but where have the people gone?' Bardric scratched his chin.  'Drakken?' The dragon said suddenly.  'Yes that is what he said.'  'The Drakken are hideous creatures that the gods should never have made. There is no reason for them to live here. They cause chaos and bloodshed. They should definitely not be here because they were banished from these lands.' Trellian hissed as smoke streamed out of his nostrils.  'I see you know some history of these Drakken.' Bardric cautiously walked closer to the dragon.  'Yes I do. I helped banished them the first time and now it looks like I am still around to do it again. We must make sure that they are here first before being hasty.' The dragon moved into position for the wizard to climb on. 'We will search the area thoroughly.'          ,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1969237,Sports-Recreation,"           So its this time of the night when I have finally worn myself out enough to have only one or two thoughts going at once. I have been trying to rather get at the root of my problems in general. The biggest of which is the annoying habit of having 11 things going at once. I mean, I can't go work on the car...I have to strip the hood with a sander, primer it, while it is drying wash dishes, while they are drying put in a load of laundry, go back and check the hood, weetsand it, finish putting away the dishes, run and throw the clothing in the dryer, check my e-mails and phone messages, toss a topcoat on the hood, fold the laundry and push the car bck into the garage. That about handles 3 hours.  Is it any wonder I get so little done? At a 9-5 job I was so limited in what I had to do that I always got it done before anyone..better and faster in every way. I suppose this burn of energy is why most bosses are terrified of me. They always think I am out to take their job...when its the last thing in the world I care about. I just want a steadt income to funs my mad adventures..my life is always away from work- but those 9-5 jobs took a heavy toll on me with all the backstabbing and jerking around. I guess I am sti;; trying to break the time wasting habits of that portion of them with all this screwing around.  I used to think I wanted like 3 women in my life at any given time...as lovers and more. I know now that isn't true. Trying to actually build a harem all those years ago (for all due purposes) is enough to kill oneself. Everytime I hear some guy spouting off about all the women he has I can tell he is lying...if they really had all that many they would be more menatlly exhausted, and the last thing they would want to do is talk about it. All these so called 'Players' are fakes for the most part. Going to a whore is whoring, not having more women.  I'm like a race car, I have a high performance chassis, but I need a track to dump it on and run the shit out of. I used to have some 50 or so issues/ projects that needed to be done and am down to like three now. That's progress. Some went away because they were a waste of energy to even want..I am happier without the complexity of that desire or what I thought was a need (a big house/ an overly fancy car/ etc). Funny, the things left are simple enough: Turn all 12 story outlines into novels, buy an older mobile home to live in so I can reduce expense, sleep until the crack of noon, go to a movie during the day when everyone else is slaving away, read a book....a focus on the much more simple. I am actually nearing a quiting point on the Jeep and its a weird feeling knowing I may actually sell it, and that I would have a certain freedom from the possision of it.  Years ago Val loaded her Miniture Dobie named Sid Viciuos into her 1967 Thunderbird, her clothes and that was it. She declared there are only two ways to be truely free: To have enough money to have everything, or to have so little money you have nothing. Either way, you have the freedom to move and live as you like. I thought then I still wanted everything. I know now she was a bodhivatsa showing me the way. I so wish I could have found her in Vegas to chat with. I always fall hard for the lesbians don't I? I still am amazed that she was 20 with an 90 year old soul.   Guess I need to get to the money part- maybe even get seriuos about a 9-5 job for a while. Sell the Jeep, move, get some income to boost marketing for the business and do the two major things that I need moeny for...go to the Findhorn Foundation in Scotland and Lasik surgery so I can get rid of these ever annoying glasses. Then again, whatever needs to happen will do just that.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1967651,indUnk,"                 Wow for the first time in a long time I had a dream that I remember! It was strange too!  So my Dad and I are in some church place (it looks really familiar too...but I can't place where I've seen it before). And we're standing in front of the altar (you know how some churches have steps leading to the altar? yeah we're standing on the top one of those). Guess who's with us? The cast of 'Whose Line is it Anyway'! Wayne was there, Colin was there, Ryan was there, and Greg was there. Guess who was at the pulpit? President Bush. I have no idea what he was doing there.  Anyway, the Whose Line crew and I do a bunch of Hoedowns while my dad and Greg just watch. But they're not origional Hoedowns. They're all Hoedowns that I have saved on my laptop and have memorized due to repeated listening sessions. Wayne takes the first verse, I do the second, Colin the third, and Ryan the fourth. However, I'm so excited that I always accidentally do Colin's along with mine.  Just as we've done so many Hoedowns that I'm about to go nuts, we start an Irish Drinking song. My dad and Greg join us. However, as anybody who's watched Whose Line should know, due to the music, you can't do an Irish Drinking song with six people. So what we do is that we're all sitting down and anybody that has an idea for the next line just stands up, blurts it out, then quickly sits down again and lets the next person go. Again, its an Irish Drinking song that I have downloaded and memorized. The only odd thing is that when it gets to the very last line, I stand up and say a different line than the one I have downloaded.  Isn't that the oddest dream? And I remember it so vividly too.

1962377,indUnk,"       My cousin Johnny died when I was barely three years old. I don't remember him at all. I hate that. He was my godfather. I know he loved me a lot, because my mom has told me that.  Aunt Annie died a few weeks ago. She was Johnny's mom. She was also Nicky's mom - he died as a baby, back in the '50s. Johnny died in 1971, in a car accident. My Uncle Nick - Aunt Annie's husband - died several years ago of a heart attack, the day before they were to move from their farm to their brand new house in town. All that is left of the family is my cousin Mary Ann. She is a strong person.  I look at photos of Johnny and I try to remember him. I don't remember much of anything before the age of 4, and even those memories are cloudy and dim. All my life, it seems, I've tried to remember something about him. Nothing ever comes.  In all the photos I have of Johnny, he looks really cool. I think I probably really liked him. I must have, since I feel such a need to remember him. I'm pretty sure that if he were still alive, I'd like him a lot.   Johnny will always be 17. He was racing in a car with some friends. I don't know who those friends were. I don't know how his death affected them. I don't know if they still, from time to time, remember Johnny, but I sure hope they do. I'm sure someone does, and not only when another funeral brings us to the place where his body was buried.  To me, Johnny isn't even a memory. He's just someone in a photograph; someone whose death caused enough pain that the family rarely mentions him. Someone very special to me - even though I know nothing more than his name and his face.   urlLink    Me, Cousin Johnny, and my brother Steve&nbsp; urlLink            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm so easily swayed that I can't really pit opinions against each other and tend to side with whatever I'm currently reading. It's not as bad as it sounds, though, because there was plenty of mud-slinging and famous disagreements between the philosophers. I guess I should work on my own philosophical justification concerning why it doesn't matter how we perceive or how there is a mental activity resulting from a physical object.

You count the sprinkles on each kid's cupcake to make sure they're equal.  You have time to shave only one leg at a time.  You hide in the bathroom to be alone.....until your child starts potty training, that is.  Your kid throws up and you catch it.  You've mastered the art of placing large quantities of pancakes and eggs on a plate without anything touching.  Your child insists that you read 'Once Upon a Potty' out loud in the church lobby and you do it.  You cling to the high moral ground on toy weapons; your child chews his toast into the shape of a gun but still isn't allowed to point it at anyone.  You hope ketchup is a vegetable, since it's the only one your child eats.  You can't bear the thought of your son's first girlfriend.  You hate the thought of his wife even more.

You can't wait until the kids are out of the house and in the next second cry because someday the kids will be out of the house.    and last, but certainly not to be forgotten....

1930446,Communications-Media,"           Hey all,  Am up to London today for a job interview, and got some news from within.  Apparently somebody told the powers that be that the program was too easy and we went to the beach all the time in the summer... dunno where they got that from.  Supposedly they have more print assignments than we did... pretty well everyday.  And an extra prof.  But communicating and orientation still seem to be great concerns.  Supposedly only one person has had a C so far, but they got the big speech on the first day.  And Cliff has already scared half of them with an e-mail about tv.  There's one guy in the class on leave from Radio-Canada.  They really need people to RSVP ASAP (how's that for acronyms) about attending the FIMS luncheon on Tues.   The new studios are still a mess of cables everywhere, but they hope to get things together still in the next couple weeks.  They've got some fancy new equipment, but the building itself seems kind of crowded.  Dave is happy cause he's able to do station feeds again, and he's going on vacation next week.

That time when I inadvertently attempted to stick my car key into the ATM machine. The time I had my first and only ride in a police car, and recalled halfway through that I had simply parked in a different spot and my car was not stolen after all. If I've ever wished to slap my forehead, that would have been the moment. Okay well that's all I can think of but isn't that enough? Anyways I got to thinking...have you ever known anybody to slip on a banana peel? Because I have this theory that the Looney Toons just made that up and all these years they had everyone thinking that banana peels were these real slippery things.

1919658,Law,"              What's Love Got to Do With It?   'Fuck me.'  I've always loved those two words.  In fact, when I was a virgin, I dreamed of the day that I could whisper that to my lover in a restaurant, a bar, or other public place; make my excuses to my friends, and proceed to have him fulfill my request and fill me.    So imagine my surprise when my last boyfriend announced that hearing the word out of a female's mouth made him less that ready to go (if you get my drift).  I looked at him as though he had given me a puppy and then taken it away.  Is this the same man who I just caught watching 'Big Booty Hoes 23: Rumble in the Rump Jungle'?  The same man who believes it's no fun without handcuffs?    How can any grown person not get slip and slide wet at the mere  mention  of those two words? After thorough questioning, he admitted that the words bothered him because they didn't gel with the act which he and I were performing.  In his eyes, we were making love, not  fucking.   Awwww.  Don't get me wrong.  I did love him.  Still do (although I'll never actually admit that to him).  And when we were having sex, I did feel a deep loving connection with him.  I felt love.  But in my eyes, making love to him is something I did every day.  I did it with every kind act, every selfless motivation, every time I picked out something from the store for him just because.  That was my lovemaking.  What we did every night in bed had nothing to do with the days I spent thinking of him.  Especially that time with the midget.  Maybe it's me.  Maybe I'm a product of too much 'Sex and the City', too much MTV and Cinemax Saturday nights.  Call me new fashioned, but I feel like a participant in a cheap romance novel when I whisper 'Make love to me.'  To me, those words just take too damn long.  They don't convey the urgency, the need, the animal lust I felt when I watched him walk across the room.  When I dragged him into the bedroom during his birthday party, I wasn't trying to 'make love' to him.  I wanted to fuck the shit out of him.  Maybe when I'm 50 I'll want a man to make love to me.  I'll also want Metamucil and a nice nap too.  But right now, I want to fuck.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to add something because- after mulling it over a bit I feel I need to make an important thing clear about my opinions. I do take my opinions very seriously while I'm pretty sure nobody else does.  Lost In Translation is a really fine movie. The comparison in the previous blog is not really fair to either. They are different kinds of movies and they achieve different kinds of things, and I think Lost In Translation is a little rough around the edges(boring)- but certainly not worth ignoring for this reason. It is a really interesting movie. It gets at an interesting quality to life, and the people behind the movie found nice ways to convey the experience- the story- whatever. It's very worth seeing, and in many ways superior to Matchstick Men- just not as well crafted. And in some ways that's nice. One should go into it expecting it's slowness- and allowing it to takes it's time. It's meditative and requires a little more of us than movies like Matchstick Men, which gives you the option of finding meaning, or just having fun on the surface. Either way, movies are great. and I'm clearly obsessed.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their report appears in the March issue of Economics and Human Biology.  'The hypothesis is worth considering that this adverse development is related to the greater social inequality, and inferior health care system, and fewer social safety nets in the United States than in Western and Northern Europe, in spite of higher per capita income,' Komlos and Baur write.  The researchers suggest that the welfare states of Western and Northern Europe -- much maligned in the U.S. -- may actually be providing a healthier standard of living than the U.S. system.   Komlos and Baur admit that Americans have a higher per capita income. But Europeans, they note, are guaranteed a subsistence income as well as cradle-to-grave health care. At least those of us who can afford it get better health care, right? Not necessarily. The researchers note that even fully insured Americans are more dissatisfied with their health care than Europeans.

Also, as happens after a good, soaking two-inch spring rain, many flowers bloomed across our country as a result of this showering of public funds on America's grassroots:  The growth that the GI Bill stimulated in higher-educational enrollment fueled a broad expansion of colleges, trade schools, and other institutions, with many new institutions and campuses reaching for the first time into inner-city and rural communities, putting advanced education within physical and economic reach of people who otherwise might not have had the opportunity, or even considered the possibility of more schooling.  The boom in enrollment also meant a boom in construction jobs, and new educational facilities created other jobs -- from teachers to janitors, administrators to cafeteria workers.  The college and university experience was dramatically democratized, broadened, and deepened as students from working-class and farm backgrounds were afforded the chance to go in large numbers to what had been havens for the elite.'

While the ones pushed upward will take 2-4 months to come down (if they don't fall out, that is), the ones pushed back are less pushed back, maybe only 10 or 15 degrees back now compared to the initial forty-five. All involved teeth may still turn a dark shade, or even fall out, but only time will tell.   I've been swabbing the teeth at night with cheese cloth in lieu of brushing, and spraying salt water on the gums with a nose hose (the infant bulb thing) since I thought there was no sensible way to get Aidan to gargle or swish it. His gums are a little swollen in the particularly hairy-looking spot today, I think I'll begin treating that with tea tree oil. I should have been making him drink green tea every day, since it prevents plaque build-up, but we're just starting that today.   The thing that's improved his recovery most of all was his dad's return for the weekend, care of dad's bosses (thank you!). We all do so much better when our little family unit is together.  Today, Aidan pointed his teeth out to me and explained, 'this one's pushed back and this one's pushed up' just like I've done a myriad of times to all our well-wishers!   I just have to say how grateful I am for our family support throughout this ordeal. My dad's quiet calm presence was invaluable, and Aunt Amanda showing up a few hours after the big toss with sticker books and a stuffed moose was also fantastic. My in-laws have called at least once every day to see how his (and my own) recovery progresses. In these days of progress, geography otherwise separates us from our natural support group.

1859926,indUnk,"   I'm buried in paper journals.  That's right.  The minute you announce to the world you are a writer -- you are immediately given journals of various shapes and sizes -- you know, to...write.  I shouldn't complain.  I think it's a nice gesture.  But my handwriting sucks.  I'm 35 and instead of it improving with age, it's gone from ok to horrific.  I blame it on the use of computers.  I blame it on using keyboards.  I never took a typing class but I can type 90 words per minute and know the keyboard by heart.  So if I have so many paper journals, why am I here?  Well, again, as stated above, I'm a typist...in addition to a writer.  It's easier for me to type.  Sounds awful, I know -- especially to some hardcore writers who think computers are evil.  To me, they're not evil -- they're useful.  I've really hit a slump in terms of my writing -- or should I say, my confidence in myself to bang something out.  Ever since my sister died three weeks ago, I stopped writing my novel.  I tried writing a little article about dog agility for a magazine -- but it didn't come out right.  The words just weren't coming.  Maybe not the words -- maybe, moreso, the thoughts behind the words.  The organization.  The flow, if you will.  No, instead I've been in a state of paralysis.  I learned that in my English classes in college.  There were writers who defined paralysis.  Who were they?  I can't remember -- though I bet if I phoned Barbara and asked her, she'd name all of them in 10 seconds or less.  Me -- I just studied before the tests.  That stuff didn't sink in far enough.  Though I do remember that James Joyce coined the term 'epiphany.'  I just can't remember who the hell wrote essays on paralysis.  I think we spent, like half a semester on that too.  I'm ashamed...but not that much.  Hey, it was over ten years ago.  So here I am -- not ready to expound on the origins of literary paralysis -- but instead to explain my very own.  As I said, my sister died.  Unexpectedly and suddenly.  Lots of stuff happened this past year -- but I think that was the clincher.  It definitely runs neck and neck with the problems we are experiencing in our quest to adopt a baby in Ukraine.  I've been sloth.  All week.  I originally thought it was because I ran too hard for the race last weekend.  There I was -- running the perfect 8 minute mile...when all of a sudden, I was wracked with cramps.  Luckily there was a bathroom within reach and so I spent five minutes on the toilet in a public bathroom, doubled-over in pain.  If the cramps weren't going to kill me, the bacteria from sitting on the toilet surely would.  And I watched my watch advance from 18 minutes to 23 minutes and counting...and I went from my perfect 8 minute mile to a 10:30 minute mile...how bad did I suck?  I came in 158 out of something ridiculous like 200.  No -- my laziness isn't just from that pitiful race.  It was a combination of things.  I began freelancing in the mornings, making my ritual of going to the gym at noon disappear.  I'm wondering what I'm going to do when Dave gets back from his tour.  How am I gonna workout with my rock star gym buddy when I'm stuck behind the desk making media calls?  It's because my ability to have a child is in someone else's control right now, preventing me from going to Ukraine and choosing my child.  It's because my husband got sick this summer and then threw himself in to his work -- which is why I'm sitting on the couch right now, right next to him, typing this stupid entry whilst he works on his laptop.  Such a cute couple.  No, it's not just one thing -- it's a combination of many...and I'm stuck wondering when I'll get out of this rut I'm in.  It better happen soon or my body is going to go from a size 4 back to a size 14 soon enough.  (I forgot to mention, too, that ice cream has become my new perfect food).  And so, here I sit and type.  Contemplative over my next move.  Will I turn on the tv or suggest we go to see 'American Splendor'?  Shall I log off and grab the ice cream or try my hand at 'Pop and Drop' -- my new highly addictive computer game?  That's just it, see -- in my weeklong disability, I've not been able to make a friggin decision to save my life.  That's how paralysis works.  ~M       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1859920,indUnk,"           well today started out like no other day everything was so so. I had to check my car again and it was not good i need to replace to back wheel cylinder mine bit the dust its leaking like a sive. But thats not it i also got my pogey today and i made an appointment at Dayton Tire to get my car lined up and new tires put on. So i go outside and what do i see but my exhaust is hanging down so i had to go get changed and get that car off the ground so i could tie the exhaust up in place. I am getting pretty sick of always having something wrong with my car it is so frustrating. It can be really expensive when you are like me and buy all new parts for the car because you do not trust second hand parts. I just do not know what to do i need to fix the car but it sems when everything is going right and working something else goes. it is just so agravating for me i fix and replace used worren parts and still i have problems, Feels like there is a target on my back when it comes to cars recently.   But i guess i will have to live with it untill it passes because well honestly there's nothing else to do except to fix all problems untill everything is brand new lol. I would never get what i got put into the car so i might as well use it and get my moneys worth out of it. But on another note there is someone in my family who turned her back on her kids that is something that i do not understand. How can someone just pack up and leave thier two kids with thier parents? I really need someone to explain this to me because for me there is no reason what so ever. I mean picture haveing two beautiful kids then one day leave them and not showing you face back home in 4-5 days (I think). I think that the person who does this has to have absolute;y no heart or conscience at all it is a tottal sin for those kids they need there mom because thier father took off not too long after the second one was born, now there is a man for you eh! I could never imagine not bothering with Tara's kids if her and i broke up and that is something we have talked about and i told her that her kids are close to me and if there was something to break us up i would still go to see the kids even though they are not mine. But we have grown close to each other the kids and i. They look up to me like they would look up to a father so hey, and they hardly ever see there real father at all so when Alex asked me to be a dad for him of course i said yes its not his fault that his father is a deadbeat daddy! So why should Alex,Logan and Emalee suffer for something that was not thier doing. I do dad things with then and i do what i can when i can and thats all that Alex sees. And that is me acting like a father to him so his natural instinct is to think of me in that way. To be honest i do not mind it neither i will just do the best that i know how.  But people its getting late and i have to get my car in Sydney for its appointment so i have to cut this session off a little short so untill next time STAY FROSTIE!          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1856131,indUnk,"       So I just finished watching Rocky IV, which is one of the newest DVDs in my collection (which, I am proud to say, should pass the century mark by the end of this month... I'm somewhere around 95 with my tax return and one paycheck to go).  And as guilty a pleasure Rocky IV is, I still can't get over the totally retarded ending.  Only Sylvester Stallone can make an ending so ridiculous that you forget about how savagely fake the beatings Rocky receives before he 'hulks up' and eventually wins are.  In the heart of the USSR, against their national hero (and if you didn't know he was their national hero, the giant 50 foot banner with his picture beside the pick and sickle should serve as an obvious visual reminder), the crowd starts to chant 'Rocky'?!?  Because of his determination and heart?  Get the fuck out of here.  That's like, in a sold out Air Canada Centre, the crowd starts chanting, 'USA! USA!' because we've outshot them 53-16 in the second period yet it's still 1-1.  It ain't happening.  That's the only thing that pisses me off about this movie.  That, and no Clubber Lang.  Clubber Lang vs Ivan Drago would be a crazy sweet fight.  Cause we all know Rocky would have had his ass stomped by these two in real life.  I'm in this weird state where I really wanna catch some old episodes of MacGyver.  I wanna see how truly fake that shit was.  I wonder if it's on DVD, or if they play it on Prime or Spike or something.  Miami Vice back to back with MacGyver would be sweet.  Like the Seinfeld/Friends or Full House/Family Matters combos.  Two great shows, one after the other.  Booyah!  Hey Wes, hook it up with the DVD (or  is it VHS) inventory program!          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1842721,indUnk,"       What a trip! Seriously, absolute best week of my life.    Outward Journey  Not the best start, it has to be said, as I get to Glasgow airport to check in, and discover that the flights have been changed, and instead of flying through Minneapolis to get there, I'm now going through Houston. This isn't too bad in the long run, as the airline is now Continental rather than KLM, and they've got nicer planes.  Flight from Glasgow - Amsterdam isn't too bad, although I discover an unnerving thing about how aircraft take off, namely that the engines always sound like they're at death's door, and planning on sending you there shortly. When it happens 6 times in 9 days though, you get used to it and realise that it's fairly normal.  Amsterdam airport in monstrously large, especially compared to Glasgow. This does mean that when you're stuck there for a few hours waiting for a connecting flight, there is at least stuff to keep you occupied. Hit the internet cafe for a bit, to make sure that Jeff had got the details of my new arrival times etc. He had, so it's all good.  The journey to Houston was LONG. 10 hours flying time, and I didn't manage to get a damn bit of sleep on it. The flight path went up past Iceland and Greenland, then down through Canada, which means next to nothing to look at (waste of a window seat, there), and the added bonus of knowing that if anything goes wrong with the plane, you're well and truly fucked as the plane'll land (not very smopothly, either) on the frozen wastelands of northern Canada.   Houston's another huge airport, and tries to outdo others by calling itself an Intercontinental airport as opposed to an international one. Which is a fair point to make, given that even pieces of shit like Prestwick call themselves international these days. Only had a 90 minute stopover or so at Houston, which was just enough time to clear immigration etc (they do NOT like sarcasm, and are inherently suspicious when someone's flights have been changed - although it's not exactly like I chose it), before getting on the plane for Vegas.   That flight was pretty uneventful, and I landed in Vegas just after 10pm local time, thus taking my total time awake clock past the 25 hour mark. Got met by Jeff and Jennabea at baggage claim, and we're off to the hotel after getting my luggage (commendably hassle free).   Check in wasn't a problem either, and my room was on the 34th floor (of 35), with a decent view westwards. It was a good size, and well equipped with all I'd need.   The City  The first thing that strikes you about Las Vegas is the sheer size of the place. Not in terms of population, but actual physical stature. Everything's just bigger. The strip's 3 miles long, and that sets the tone for the rest of the place. With well laid out streets, and parking just about anywhere that you could want it, it's a far cry from the dense jungle of roads that is Glasgow. Distances were such that a $5 all day bus ticket was soon a good friend of mine.  The city looks really nice too, and it shows that it's been built relatively recently (well, compared to my city, it's new). Once darkness falls, it's a totallty different ball game, as the lights come on, and turn the place into a power plant owner's wet dream. Not that it's bad, but the neon and flashy lights can go for your head after a while.   The Weather  Baking. Absolutely fucking BAKING. To be expected, since it's in a desert, but still. 70 degrees at night, and up above 90 during the day, and it's still only April. To contrast this, in Glasgow, 70's considered roasting even in the height of summer. It is a dry heat though, so you don't feel as uncomfortable as you would over here. Once it's night, that's the best time to go out, and certainly that's when I felt most at ease.   Food  Biggest. Portions. Ever. In really hot weather, my appetite goes down, and I was rarely able to finish everything, such was the amount they gave out. I found out the hard way how much a fluid ounce is, when I ordered a 44oz Pepsi (hey, only $1.75), and practically died when I got handed over 1300ml worth of said cold beverage. Other food notes: I am addicted to Gatorade, it is official. In and Out is the god of fast food places. Free refills of soft drinks = a good thing. Mmmmm....sushi.   The People  Don't think I've ever met a friendlier bunch of people in my life. Perhaps it's because the city is so reliant on tourism, but the customer service skills are off the charts, and when they say 'Have a nice day', you get the feeling that they actually want you to have a nice day, which is pleasnt change form this country.  Also met a bunch of Jeff's mates, and again, without exception, they all seem really cool. My accent was fairly popular as well, which is fine by me, as I don't exactly have to work on it.   Other random stuff  - Ended up at a party for Jenny and Jennabea's birthdays. Got drunk. I have now decided that that will have been my last time drinking alcohol, ever. While I had fun, I also noticed a creeping onslaught of the things I don't like about a drunken me. Managed to keep it in check, but still, I'm not drinking again. The party was good fun though, as I show my prowess at shotgunning to all concerned, and laugh as they all fail in their attempts to keep up. My wrestling fanboy action also appeared, as Jeff got a chokeslam and a Tazzmission, and Mikki ended up in a Scorpion Deathlock.  - Did a bungee jump. Was really good fun, although after the fact. There's nothing quite like the terror as you're going over the edge, and one of the attendants asks 'Isn't that meant to be attached?' Oh those pesky kids.  - Saw Kill Bill 2, although kept dozing off during it, mainly because I'd been awake for 44 of the previous 48 hours, resulting in much 'prod-and-stab-so-he-stays-awake' from Jennabea. Loved what I saw.  - Saw The Punisher. Not a bad movie, but then, I've never read the comics. It's worrying when Kevin Nash is in the best scene in a movie.  - Got taken to a strip club (Hell, it's Vegas, it's practically my duty to go). Almost HHH'd my drink at one point.  - When having sushi, beware of the death roll, unless of course you wish to lose the ability to taste anything for the next 20 minutes.  - A 10 minute cab ride from hotel to airport is more than enough time for a lecture about the importance of bringing the lord jesus into one's life, it appears.  That's all I can really think of to say at the moment. I'm sure more'll come back to me, but I just want to reiterate, best week of my life, ever.    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well I might say this phrase came into play this weekend while watching my parents with other people. hmm. I still have some things to work out with them.

Well i guess I still have a week left, but at the beginning I had a huge mother of a list of things to do this summer. I don't think I actually wrote it down, but it was considered a mental list.

1822234,indUnk,"       I thought a lot about the whole  urlLink boob  thing yesterday and all the things I wanted to say about it.  But then I realized that everyone thought about it and everything that's going to be said has been said.  So now everyone is over the incident, especially me.  I think I was over the whole thing after we watched it for the 11th time (in slow motion) on TiVo (courtesy of Max and Julianne).  About 4 times of watching the 'wardrobe mishap' cleared up how intentional the act was, around time number 6 it had lost it's novelty and shock value and I would say that sometime around # 8 is when depression set in. 11 really pushed the envelope, but we had to be sure.  Of what?  I don't know. Everyone at work had it pictures up on their monitors within 20 minutes of their arrival on Monday morning.  Not me though, I was extremely busy... not only did I have to change my desk calendar but there was a  wall  calendar that needed my attention as well.   Last night I had my worst tap class ever.  I don't know what happened, but there were definitely a few moments where I thought I might have to run out of the room in sheer panic.  The first thing that threw me off was my embarrassing rendition of a stamp within the first 3 minutes of class.  It's pretty obvious what it should be, you just put your foot down ... keeping your ankles loose, let your heel fall first.  easy, like walking.  Easy until the teacher said 'think Frankenstien'.  Apparently I thought about him a little too much and tried some bad method acting to actually  be  Frankenstien.  Picture this: a bunch of people watching me walk across a dance studio as if brooms were shoved up each of my pant legs.  Add a puzzled look on my face which is slowly turning red.  Is what you picture starting to look like me being a really big ass in front of the rest of the class?  Swell, then you've got the idea.  I stomped across the floor wondering why I felt so stupid, until the teacher laughed while telling me to not forget to bend my knees.  If my memory serves me correctly (and I might be exaggerating a little here) I had my arms straight out like a fucking zombie and my  urlLink eyes  looked like something out of the Thriller video.  And then I shouted 'aaaaggghhhhh..... frieeeeend.....frieeeeend!' scaring all the small children in the karate class next door, sending parents into a frenzy with torches to chase me from the village.  My confidence was pretty much shot after that.  He singled us out for some exercises which resulted in me further making an ass of myself.  At one point I just walked over to the corner and said 'I'm out'.  I think everyone breathed a sigh of relief with my retirement; who wants to dance next to a freakin' monster?

DUMLAO aka JHOETTE    Vitals:  Met in the 7th grade way back in 1990, on the first day of school, me in my plaid skirt and white blouse and Jhoette in his PE UNIFORM!!! Did no one tell this boy he was only allowed to wear that on PE DAYS? = 14 years and counting  Role in My Life:  Apprehensive Healer - Jhoette used to tell me, 'If you ever need someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on...ask Iya, cuz I'm not good at that stuff.' Jhoette says he feels helpless when we come crying to him because a boy broke our heart or we're feeling down about life. He underestimates his abilities as a comforter of the down and out. Sometimes he really didn't know what to say. But when I think of all the times he's made me or anyone feel better, it's never his fumbling words I remember, it's him holding my hand and letting the tears flow freely.   Good Times:  During our sophomore year at UCI, Jhoette pledged for a fraternity and, to make a long story short, some of us (ok fine, me and Iya) felt neglected and sore about having to deal with his absence in our lives. He crossed over after the fall quarter. On the eve of my 20th birthday, while I was studying for an econ midterm, Reyna ran up to our room and told me to hurry downstairs because someone came to greet me Happy Birthday.

1807720,Student,"             I went to the Stampede Breakfast at the Somerset/Shawnessy station today.  I went up twice for Breakfast because I got like the smallest pancakes I ever did see in my life and I was still starving and we had got there early so I ate two plates.  Then I saw Chels and her mom and Chels and I went up to the platform and we got to see the major driving the train into the station.  Chels and I tried to huddle by the photographers and the cameras, lol.  When he got off the train it was like endless pictures over and over.  It was really neat to see what it is like to be known and be in the publics eye.  It was kind of cool.  Then he went around shaking hands, taking pictures with kids, and when he came to Chels and I we though he was going to shake our hands, but then he put his hand up and we high-fived him.  It was funny.  My mom said that he probably just wanted to be hip and 'in' with the young people.  You know what, I think it worked.  After that my mom and I did a bunch of just little stuff, just going here and there.  Then I went to the YMCA for a workout.  I did an hour of cardio, 45 minute walk around the track, and I think about half an hour of weights.  Then I got home, and was hungry. You know I had envisioned eating like an apple for lunch, but as I opened my cupboard I discovered chocolates that weren't there before.  It was like calling my name I swear.  Besides, I think I worked out enough that it won't really have an effect.  I have managed to stay at 137, but I have shaped up and everything, my arms and my legs I can totally feel and even notice physically now that there is a difference since I started to work out all the time.  And well it's almost Stampede time and though I start Summer School soon it's like tradition to go to as many Stampede Breakfasts as possible, so really I mean bring on the pancakes and sausages.

180519,indUnk,"       my dad got fired from his job at jackinthebox today. for no good reason, other than that his bosses didn't like him. hurray for california and employment at will. it's weird. i'm not worried but it didn't seem like something that would ever happen. i was more worried back in sixth grade when the e. coli scare was happening. it seems that i get less worried about things the older i am. that doesn't make sense to me, because the more you know about something, the more you understand the consequences. then again, maybe it does make sense, because you know that there are more options and it doesn't seem so much like the end of the world. i dunno. i've stopped worrying about stuff that isn't small enough. :) i'll still be able to go to school and all that. maybe i'll pay more of the rent. that's not so bad. i have two jobs, and for both of them i get a raise this coming semester because the university is cool like that. i don't worry about money. i can live without things. it's just surreal. then it gets me wondering. i think i should understand all this stuff. all this how to make it in the real world stuff. i can't forsee myself being terribly rich and famous; my trombone skills aren't good enough for that, but then again i just want to be happy somewhere. i had an idea the other day. for a radio station that plays a greater mix of 'classical' (and i would come up with a new term for that) music, not just the stuff everyone knows or is the most relaxing. i think that would be fun. maybe i can be a professor. i like music history...what am i going to go to grad school for? who knows. it's hard to believe that i can make it as a performer in anything but Podunk Symphony Orchestra, with all the competition out there. I want to be in a brass quintet, most of all. But I wouldn't mind doing whatever, as long as it was with music. as long as i could be a part of the family...that's what i love best about music, it ties everyone who does it together. look at all my friends at school! only one or two aren't in music school.   i guess the thought here is, i don't really see myself being successful, but successful in the sense that i have a lot of money and respect or whatever. money and security and tax forms and health insurance...i will do all these things, but i won't worry about them. it is of no importance to me. now i'm remembering the essay i wrote for my UC applications, way back when...all about 'the path least travelled' and how 'i'll never do anything if it doesn't make me happy.' i still believe it. it's been a bit buried lately, but i still believe it. and now i have a definition of happiness...yeah, i think i can figure this life thing out, it just takes a little time and a lot of patience. no worries, i've got both.

180519,indUnk,"        southern california: it's not just for weather-wimps anymore   Went over to Borders for my Monday Night Chai, plunked myself down in front of the 'women's studies' section (in quotes because some things don't really belong there, and also, they are too lazy to alphabetize it. tsk tsk. Shoulda hired me when you had the chance, bitches....I mean, you still can. I need a job. Please hire me!), and found a very interesting book:  urlLink  Indigenous: Growing Up Californian  , by Cris Mazza.  Mazza's life, in the pages I flipped through, parallels mine in some pretty crazy ways. She grew up in San Diego, which was my first draw to the book. She played trombone in marching band, one of the first girls in her school to do so. The way she talks about gender politics as it relates to band ring true for me, and she deftly describes what it's like to be a 'girl among trombonists'...I would love to read that section in depth. She went away to the Midwest (Chicago) for school. While there, she dealt with all the stereotypes I dealt with (do you miss the weather? do you surf? is everyone blonde? do you see a lot of celebrities?) and was equally as frustrated. She also devotes a chapter to the San Diego Symphony, its financial woes, and how America views the arts. It's fascinating. I've added it to my wish list (oh, if I could read everything I wanted to) because I'm just stunned at our similar lives and her insights on being a Californian.   My friends in Wisconsin will attest to how annoyed the following question made me: 'Why in the world would you come here when you live in Southern California?' The implication is that weather determines how great a place is, and that once you've lived there, you can't live anywhere else. Incidentally, the questioner would always follow up the statement with 'I could never live there. I like seasons. Plus, what's Christmas without snow?' thus annoying me further. We have seasons, bitch. It's raining right now. Because it's winter, and that's what it does. Oh, but you're right, we don't have any Christmas spirit here. We suck.   Anyway, my responses to this question got more creative with time (usually I would invoke a stereotype of Wisconsin just to get back at them: 'I like the smell of cows' 'I wanted to see how much bratwurst I could eat in four years' etc). The truth is, I love Wisconsin. I love San Diego. I love being from both places. Well-rounded character traits and all. While I will play along with stereotypical jokes about either locale, I retain the right to ignore anyone who is genuinely insulting or ignorant.   There are of course downsides to both locations. I am not enjoying my year here in SD because I have few friends, am dependent on my car, and live in the suburbs. Were I in the thick of the action downtown, I would in all likelihood feel differently. San Diego frustrates me with its conservatism (it is after a military town with a high population of retirees and ex-Midwesterners) and its racism (you can quote diversity statistics, but the truth of it is that Hispanics get a very, very,  very  bad rap here). But Madison could similarly frustrate me with its little hypocrisies as well. Any place is like that, because people have different viewpoints anywhere you settle.   Like Mazza, I too can discount any of the stereotypes people have of southern Californians just on the basis of people I know. The friends who were born here, raised here, and consider themselves San Diegans are the least stereotypical of all. Many times at school I felt myself slipping into stereotypes just so I could get some attention, but the truth of it is I'm not a surfer, I'm not blonde, and I don't rollerblade with my poodle (but I do have a poodle...man, it just occurred to me what a jip poodles get. That is a damn stupid name for an otherwise wonderful dog). The surfer exists, and I'm not knocking it. Someday I too would like to be a surfer, because it looks like fun and I like the ocean. The characteristics I love best about San Diego and San Diegans are the most often overlooked. The ocean is great, but you can't deny the beauty of our mountains, our canyons, and our deserts. San Diegans are some of the most fit people in the country (and that is a stereotype), because of the nature of our environment. Hiking, biking, swimming, and just plain walking are so enjoyable here because of the things you get to look at while you are doing said activities. If a friend comes to visit me, I will take them to Torrey Pines because it is breathtakingly beautiful, but I will also take them to Los Penasquitos to get a true feel for chaparral and canyon wildlife (friends who visit me will always be taken hiking. You cannot escape it, do not even try).   Well, there you have it in plain english why RW: San Diego pisses me off so much. There is a nightlife here, sure. But it ain't all we do, and those idiots will be sorry they didn't ever get east of the airport (quite a task, I assure you; the airport being almost on top of the harbor). But more than that, I hate to see my pretty city get stereotyped and pigeonholed. Pan your camera over the Mission Beach boardwalk all you want, but that ain't the half of it. I think the wildfires surprised some people back east because they didn't realize how much wild land San Diego County actually includes. That before the palm trees and well-manicured lawns it was all scrub brush and cactus. Fire is a way of life. Many of us despaired to see our mountains and canyons go up in flames almost as much as the devastating loss of homes and lives. Those of us with common sense do not appreciate the Governator. Electricity is not a thing to flaunt. Water is precious. Punk rock is sacred.  So, a word of warning to the haters: the note of scorn I hear in your voice when you say 'California should just drop into the ocean and do us all a favor' better damn well fuck off, and you too. Because it's my home, and it's more than just a bunch of blondes and surfers and suburban rich kids. Maybe you should come here and give it a try. Hopefully we won't break off into the Pacific while you're here.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
180519,indUnk,"        heigh ho, the working life   it's 10:10 and I want to go to bed. I'm exhausted. I worked all day again today, picking up the clothes that people are too fucking inconsiderate to at least leave right-side out, if not on the hanger. Plus I have this bruise on my left hand, in between my thumb and forefinger, from putting hangers there while I hang other things up. The floor in the juniors section (who wears these clothes? they're terrible! so ugly. so tiny!) is crowded beyond belief with clothes racks so every time you walk by an overhung rack ten shirts fall off. AND, because lately the trend is to make shirts that aren't hanger-compatible, they fall off the hanger too. Hanging up women's suits and dresses is the worst. They're all heavy and awkward (i've tripped over a few), and they aren't sorted by brand like the rest of the store. They're sorted by something like fabric, or cut. Ri-goddamn-diculous.   Oh, yeah, and this is my favorite part: I left to go to the bathroom, on my way back folded some sweaters, and walked back into the dressing room to find that Hurricane PregnantWoman had been through, along with Tropical Storms OmigodSixteenYearOld and YoungJetSetTrendyWoman.  In ONE (1) dressing room, there was a pile of maternity clothes on the bench and a heap or two of blouses on the floor. ALL of the blouses were inside out. Several hangers were broken. All of the Misses stuff has to be taken back to the Misses section, and there's a fucking lot of it. I left it there. They can come and get it for all I care. The maternity stuff is easy enough except while I was sorting through one dressing room, ANOTHER pregnant woman came by and left a different dressing room in shambles. Now, the maternity section can't be more than a hundred feet long. It had to have been seriously depleted by this nightmare.   Not really diggin' the job so much. Let's say this, my feet hurt. I was walking and standing for eight hours. Yesterday too. My co-workers are nice, but it's not the kind of job where you get to stand around and chat because JC Penney has sale after sale after sale, and the bargain shoppers are endless. Everytime I go to put one pair of jeans back on the rack, another has shown up in its place. I feel like there is an appropriate metaphor for this phenomenom, but I can't recall it at the moment. Maybe something like removing grains of sand from a beach with a tweezer. Maybe that's it. Argh. Well, I do it again tomorrow and then I have two and a half days off. Neat-o. Because schools are closed I don't have to go in for coaching, so that's nice too. I'm a little bit worried that working such long hours will cost me a lot of practice time, especially since when I get home I just want to stare at the TV until I feel it is a reasonable time to retire. Sigh. Planning on campaigning for smaller chunks.   Today my moving back to Madison meter is leaning back over to going. I am especially missing Jerry and the comfort he would be giving me after such a long day. Being realistic is hard when you're lonely.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1803787,Publishing,"       Today was supposed to be an easy day.. One more day on my way towards the weekend. I have been feeling so sick and tired and droopy thinking maybe I have mono. So today my grandfather passed away. He was eighty eight years old. He was all that I ever looked up to and all that I ever strove to be. I mean he was the ICON. Frank Schubert was the last civilian lighthouse keeper in north america. He lived in a cottage house in Coney Island, Brooklyn, NY manning the lighthouse . He was quiet and humble, lived simple but was funny and classic in the old time way. He watched football and baseball and loved to go bowling or play golf. No matter how old he got he could still kick our butts. He was the biggest thing to me, he was the only one who I ever cared what he thought or mattered to. That may not make any sense but if you knew Frank Schubert you would know him as a guy who was always there willing to help you, not only by giving you money or food but by showing you how to work, to build, to fish or cook. I am so happy that I could spend all 23 years of my life growing up with him . We built picnic tables and benches, we built coffee tables and picture frames, we even built a dog house for my puppy. He taught me how to golf and bowl, always being patient with me and really guiding me, adjusting when I lost my temper. He was a real man and someone that I will miss for ever. It is rough knowing that my children and my brothers & cousin's children will never get to meet the man who was so bigger than life. All I can say now is that he is up in heaven with my grandmother who has waited so many years for him to come to her. I just wish people would know who he was all the good and the very little bad. He was stubborn and we have all inherited that trait from him and he maybe did things differently his way was not always the best and probably could have been better. Frank Schubert was always himself never bowing down for anyone and never giving up his stance, no matter how wrong or right he was. He was a beautiful artist, creating masterpieces of woodwork, and paintings. I finally feel like man, maybe his passing is forcing me to stand up and move up in the world.. or maybe it is just giving me the strength to harness my power and talent and creative mind and go out and become the man he wanted me to be. I love frank Schubert and must say that he will be missed forever by me and by many other generations to come. Rest in peace and may st.peter and jesus welcome you with open arms.   Liz sent me this prayer and I wanted to share it with everyone so that they can remember to keep Frank Schubert in their prayers.   O Christ Jesus, when all is darkness and we feel our weakness and helplessness, give us the sense of Your presence, Your love, and Your strength. Help us to have perfect trust in Your protecting love and strengthening power, so that nothing may frighten or worry us, for, living close to You, we shall see Your hand, Your purpose, Your will through all things. Amen.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1798668,Science,"             As everyone probably knows, after I get my PhD, I want to do my post doc abroad. My boss here has the hook up in Japan, Germany, and England. Also as everyone knows, I LOVED Japan, and really want to go back. But after reading these two articles ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) well, Germany isn't sounding so bad. And think of all the travel options I will have! I mean, hey! Long weekend? Lets go to Spain! Or Greece!   Maybe I'm a bit ahead of myself.   I'M GOING TO NORTH CAROLINA FROM MAY 7TH TO 10TH!!! Its going to be so much fun. Biggest adventure I've had in a long while. I've never been to that state, and once there, I've got it all laid out for me. I'm actually flying into Virginia and Man is picking me up at the airport, then we go back to Cape Hattaras. He says he will bring his small kite so that he can teach me to kite board! Yay! Its supposed to be so pretty, he sent me a post card a few days ago that he bought there. I'm so excited. Hmmm... two weeks to get my swim suit body in line. Protein!!  Speaking of getting in shape, the other night I didn't go to the gym (actually, I did, but once there I realized I forgot my pass and my towel so I went home) and I did some ballet barre excersizes in my living room. I HAVE A LIVING ROOM!! Anyways, I forgot how friggin' hard that stuff was. Damn! No wonder my legs were bad ass when I was taking those hard core ballet classes. Even judo has nothing on an advanced ballet workout. I need to start doing that after I get home from the gym at least every other night. Get those legs back, man!  Dance and fitness, thats the theme of today's blog I think. Wait, its the theme of all blogs.   Tomorrow I have a dance practice for the Jersey Village Gold Duster reunion Spring Show, from 8AM TO 5PM!! If I'm there that long, I better be doing some bad ass stuff. I don't want to be there and do something like 'turn, turn, turn, step, turn, turn, turn, JAZZ HANDS!' But anyways, tonight I will go to my mom's and stay there so I don't have to wake up at some un-godly hour. And tonite, I will also go to 24 Hour Eye Candy and do some lifting. Lets me gaze upon the hotness one more time. ^_^   Last night I was at the lab from 11pm to 1am. And guess what, I was not the last to leave. Ping came in around 11:30pm and was working when I left. Of course, its about 10:15am now and she still isn't in yet. So came in an hour late myself. Thanks to the living close, this is an option now. Yay!  NORTH CAROLINA!! FUN! WATER! MAN!  My grandma and grandpa are moving to Houston this summer!! This weekend my dad is going to Mississippi to start bring home some of the smaller furniture and help clean out the house they are in right now. I told him to bring me a few night stands/end tables and cool stuff that they otherwise would throw away. Also, my grandma does alot of painting, and if he finds any with bold colors, like burgundy, hunter, and navy, to bring them for my walls, which are pretty bare. (I'm trying to steer clear of my kanji posters and japanese prints that adorned my college era homes)   When they finally move in, I will prolly spend so much time there, having grandma teach me more about oil and china painting, and I really want her to teach me some of the southeast asian and indian dishes she learned to cook while she lived in Singapore. And they lived for years in Venezuela, I bet she could teach me some cool South American style things. And grandpa is just hilarious, bright man with a great sense of humor. Sadly, he's in the beginings of Alzheimer's, and he's become less, censured I guess, more lewd than he used to be. Luckily, there aren't any young children around anymore, so we don't have to worry too much about that, and the rest of us understand the predicament and are old enough to just let it all slide. He's, what, 85 now?   It was bound to happen. Other than that he's still healthy. Most Alzheimers patients see the startings around their late 60's, early 70's, so he's really led a great life. They say that the more you excersize your thinking capacity the more it puts off such sorts of mental diseases. He has his PhD in chemical engineering, and worked well into his 70's. If anyone works their mental prowess late into life, it's him.   Yeah, if you can't tell, I think my grandparents rock.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1798668,Science,"             Yeah, thats right! The day may be grey, and the rain can taunt me, but my highlighters are pretty. There are eight of them, arranged from orange to green.   No, i just switched them to match the visible color spectrum.  Yesterday, I didn't get out of work until 6:30!! I didn't get home until after 8! Needless to day, I didn't go work out. I was starving. I was tired. I was frustrated.   I'm going to hit the books. I printed out some Spanish lessons from the computer. I need to put my Japanese lessons in something not so bulky. I spent lunch today reading over Spanish grammar.   My nails are growing! I put a nail hardener on them and it seems to be working. It feels weird to type. My hands actually look like the belong to a girl for once. That will all change if I start fighting again. If? No, when.   I finished all my cell stuff for today, so I think I will leave at 5 to make up for staying late yesterday. So nasty outside. Oh, but I can't wait to get on the rail or the bus to read my book! Angels and Deamons, by the same guy that wrote 'Da Vinci Code'. Just excellent. I probably will read his other mystery novels too, he writes so intellegently, they are very well researched novels.   I just spent about 20 min looking at a physics website. Whats wrong with me. I hate all things math, and that includes physics.   You  know what, i'm outta here. (cause I'm DOUG!)

1796990,Sports-Recreation,"                 Well I was looking at this site and I realized that I haven't updated in a long time and I wondered why that was.  It wasn't because nothing had happened to me recently because things have happened(I got my drivers liscense and the mederocere 1190 results from taking my psats).  I think the reason I don't update anymore is because no one wants to read the stuff I post anymore.  I mean here we have Evil Rob running away to the ends of the Earth for this debate fetish he has while Simmons keeps obsessing about this unqunchable thirst for 1st place in speech tournaments.  I thought I would go and set up this sweet event on MLK weekend because everyone was complaining about the Youth Renewals of past years.  So everything was all good and the bums I call friends said they were coming.  But then one by one the 'old crew' bailed out with crappy excuses and just plain lazyness.  This really sucked because there were perfect conditions for this retreat.  I mean there was DDR and no school the next day.  On top of that there were cool games planned and a big screen TV for DDR and watching movies.  I still went and the weekend was pure sweetness but it could have been even better they had come through.  Understandably I was pissed at those bafoons not because they didn't want to do but because they blew me off with fake or stupid excuses that didn't make any sense.  I know they are busy but come on people you gotta look at what your doing.  I can get busy some times but that doesn't stop me from seeing the old crew if they want to do something.    Evil Rob you really have to lay off the debate, it's taking over your life.  I don't really see how you could value cutting cards(not playing cards if anyone actually reads this) above anything else but you seem to want to stay home all the time and do it instead of going anywhere.  I think it just sucks that everyone from SWS is finally seperating after mostly staying together for the 1st half of high school.  I actually have an interview at Mr. Hero tomorrow but I think we can still keep it together man.  If nothing is done I'm gonna fall off of the face of the Earth like Joe Strelnik did.

1796990,Sports-Recreation,"                 Finally the return of the updates that control your lives.  Well maybe not but this is the first new update in a while.  It all started after taking 3 of my 4 in car driving lessons with a real stickler named Norm.  He sucked so I was really looking forward to driving with the “cool” guy named Steve.  So Steve pulled up to my house and I got in the car at 5:00.   I knew right away that this in car would not be like the others.  Steve asked me what I listened to and then turned up the volume on 100.7 WMMS.  As we pulled out of my apartment complex, Steve said, “yeah, just go wherever you want, we’ve got two hours to kill.”  I was like ok whatever, turned left, and kept going strait down Ridge rd. for like 20 minutes.  By this time Steve was getting bored and complaining about driving for 2 hours for no apparent reason so we turned left again onto Route 6 I think.  After that we took the REALLY long way to Lakeland Community College where I had to do maneuverability.  So I did the whole test twice and Steve was talking on the phone with Bruce the whole time.  So after I do it twice perfectly Steve hangs up the phone and says, “Man that Bruce is such a little chatterbox.”  So he’s like you don‘t have to do this thing anymore if you don’t want to, your good enough to pass anyway.   Then he says he wants to go over by a tree to have a smoke.  I’m thinking ok whatever he’s gonna smoke and then we can go drive around some more and go home.  Steve gets out of the car to have a smoke and he tells me I can drive around as long as I don’t wreck the car.  So I’m driving around in this car when I only have my temps and Steve is standing there smoking.  It would have been an awkward situation if I would have crashed in the Drivers ed car without a Drivers ed teacher in the car.  I didn’t crash though and I went back and picked Steve up.  When I get him he’s on his cell phone again and he’s talking to someone and telling them that he had the best driver he’s ever seen in the car.  Well I’d say he‘s in the top 3 and I can’t even remember the other 2 is what he said.  So after that we are pulling out of the parking lot and we see Norm pulling into the parking lot at the same time so Steve Honks the horn at them and yells HEY NORM.  Less than a minute later Steve was honking at the campus cop and then we were on the road again.  So by this time it’s almost time to go pick up the next person who was driving after me and we go to the gas station to fill the tank up before we get on the freeway.  So Steve fills up the tank and asks me if I want anything from inside the gas station.  I tell him I’m fine but he brings out all kind of food anyway.  So we get on the freeway to get back to Willowick from wherever we were and Steve hands me a doughnut.  I’m like ok whatever and keep driving when Steve cranks up the volume on the radio and tells me to go faster because people are passing us.   So there I am driving down the freeway at like 70mph with one hand, eating a doughnut with the other hand in the drivers ed car with the stereo blasting WMMS, and passing all these cars on the freeway.  As if that wasn’t bad enough, I am eating this doughnut wrong and all the jelly comes dripping out the end of it and it’s going all over the place.  So now Steve is laughing and I’m laughing and choking with this doughnut flying all over the car while still trying to drive down the freeway so Steve tells me I have to switch lanes to get off the freeway.  I somehow get off the freeway and make it into another gas station to get all this jelly off of my shirt and my hands.  I get back in the car and go to this girl’s house to pick her up in the car.  When she gets in the car she sits down and lets out a death shriek and Steve asks her if she saw a bug or what.  It turns out that there was a bunch of jelly on the seatbelt and it looked like human blood.  Apparently she was afraid she was dying or something, but anyway she gets in the car and starts to drive.  While still on the back streets I find out that this girl has a fetish for subway and that she gets the same sandwich with a bunch of gay crap on it every time.  She explained it in detail but all I can remember is that it had cheese, mustard, mayo, and chicken on the same bun.  Scary if you ask me.  We got onto the main roads and she kept giving me whiplash on the starts and stops.  Then we were stopped at a light with some guy in a pickup truck sitting next to us and Steve tells this girl that she should look this guy in the eye and nod so he will know that it is time to race.  Of course she does it and when the light turns green she slams on the gas pedal.  The speed limit was 50 on that road but we were soon going way faster than that.  When Steve asked her if she wanted to slow down she said “You can’t get a ticket in the driver’s ed car, can you??” Of course you can so we slowed down and stopped at a red light about an inch behind the car in front of us.  Finally we pull up to my apartment and I get out while Steve is making fun of that chick for liking high school football.  I was left dazed and confused but it was awesome and would do it again if I could.    And now because this site is based off of making fun of Simmons or copying off of his website I give you the quote of the week.  “You can’t get a ticket in the driver’s ed car, can you??”   ~chick who was driving after I did                ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1794926,Communications-Media,"       I just read a sad report about how the Great Apes are going extinct.  Apparently, they often die from human diseases like the flu.  Kind of a strange throwback to the destruction of Native Americans by European diseases.  Also, the apes are extensively hunted for meat because the native people are so poor they need the food.  This seems to be a common theme all over the world.  People are so desparate that they don't consider their enviroment.  To them, a rainforest is just a bunch of plants in the way of grazing land.  It seems to me that helping the people improve their situations is a good way to protect the environment.  I think it's especially important for richer countries to help others with birth control.  It's terrible that President Bush cut funding for birth control.  This kind of squimishness about a public health issue could destroy a lot of the planet.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1790195,Tourism,"                  numerous blog entries all at once...     so before i leave for ocean city on wednesday morning, i have to blog for the week to keep you entertained!!!  i guess the first portion of this infamous blog entry should recap my weekend.  well you all know what happened friday because i've already blogged.   saturday i worked and then went shopping with sb.  that's code for safety blanket.  i picked up sheets, a lot of kitchen stuff, a closet organizer thingie, and shot glasses.  i was quite excited even though i saw a comforter/bed in a bag at linens and things for 110 dollars less than i paid for just the comforter from macys.  but the one i got from macys is ralph lauren so that shit is gonna last for awhile.  saturday night i didn't do shit.  rob was giving marissa hell but i couldn't even move.  i passed out watching armageddon, moved to my bed, and slept for another 9 hours.  it was magical.  i've been so frickin' (to steal your word) exhausted that it was well deserved sleep.  sunday i cleaned the house up nice, and bought the matching plates so the kitchen set i had bought the day before, and i also returned that busted hamster cage i got from petco.  sweeeeeeeeeet.  too bad my dad ruined the rest of the day.  sometimes he's just so brazen and hostile that it really just makes me upset.  i couldn't even eat dinner, and it was indian food!!!  in his twisted little mind he thinks that i'm moving in with my sb and lying and saying it's marissa.  ok 1. no way and 2. you're fucking retarded.  (my dad).  so that royally pissed me off, and then i decided that it was really time to start doing things for myself, to prove things to myself, so i severed  most  ties with my sb in order to kind of, get my head straight, rediscover myself, and realize what i want out of my life.  although i could probably do that all the while keeping our relationship the same, i think my view's been somewhat cloudy for the past couple of months, especially since march 11th.  but it's time to get my head right.  i've got too much shit coming up not to.  30 more days right??  september 8th will creep up quickly.

I stopped at a gas station, filled up, went inside and paid, and when I came back outside my engine coolant was all over the ground instead of in my radiator. Yay for old cars!  But God was looking out for me. At this point in the trip, exits were 10-15 miles apart, and I just happened to stop at the ONE gas station that had a truck garage in the back. I got my car over there, they checked it out, ordered a new radiator, and 4 hours later I was back on the road. I ended up getting to Dan and Abby's place at 11:30 at night, so even with the 4 hour delay it wasn't so bad. Good thing I started the trip at 4 in the morning...

Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I should ever come back.

An inflatable doll?  An ironing board?    Well, if you guessed ironing board you would have not been alone.  This morning when I took out the trash, and smoked my first cigarette of the morning outside to keep my house spring time fresh, a man was shoveling his car out from under a huge a pile of snow with an ironing board he found leaning against the tree in front of my building.  I watched him as he tirelessly removed about 5% of the snow barricading his car into the drift.  I was amused when he got back in the car and tried to get out by shifting ever so slightly back and forth trying to get over the two foot high snowy lump blocking his tire.  I was even more amused when he got back out of the car and walked back over to the ironing board and attempted to clear away another 5% of the offending pile.

1746368,Student,"           Well, today was, for the most part, a bad day. Only because of one thing. One of my best friends is moving to Portland, Oregon. She has been one of my very good friends since 7th grade, and we have gotten very close over the past year. This will affect me a lot. I have a lot of friends that I look up to and she is one of them.   Also today I talked with a friend that I haven't talked to in a while. She and I were in a 3rd-4th grade combination class when I was in third and she in fourth. I just found out that at that time we were both loners, and would've gotten along well.   Wow, first day, pretty good for school at least (that is, besides knowing about Jessica). My first period class (Tech Assistant), is going to be probably one of my favorite classes this year. I am so far the only PC tech they have. I was pretty muched raised using a PC, so I kind of know what to do, for the most part. Alec (my teacher) says that I pretty much need common sense to be in this class. For those of you who know me, well you be the judge of how much CS I have.   Second class of the day--Web Page Design. Half of the websites to the left (the ones under links, not the diaries) are mine. If you took a look at those, you would see right away that I am probably not going to have to much problems with that. Although, we are using a different kind of program than I normally use (in fact, we are doing something that I downright hate; I think it's ok to hate an inanimate object). We are using something called by many as 'What you see, is what you get'. Basically, it is whatever you put on the page, and you see put, is what is going to happen. I cannot stand that method. I think it is stupid in general. Granted, for people who are just beginning web-page design. I use the coding method, that may take longer, but it is more rewarding at the end. Just to know that you did this yourself and you had a big hand in the outcome, instead of a program doing it for you. Like I said, this is a class that's going to be easy, and the teacher wont know if I used it or not.  Third period (or block for you Granada folks)--US History. This class is the only competition for my favorite class. The teacher is one of my favorite teachers. The only problem is, techincally it won't be real competition until December or January. Mr. Wood is on millitary leave until then. The subsitute teacher said that she doesn't think that he even knows he's teaching this class (he normally teaches Geography and a class called AVID).  Fourth (although it wasn't really in this order; it went 1, 2, 3, 5/Lunch\6, 7, 4, 8...this was so that people who didn't take an 8th or a 4th could leave at the normal time) was my hardest class of all time. I had to walk all the way to Wienershnitzel and get a large fry and a large soda, than walk all the way back and eat it on campus. Man that was hard. Okay, it wasn't really hard. I was being sarcastic for those people who didn't catch it. I have a free period that time, and it was actually during the normal time I eat lunch. Since I'm a junior now, my parents are letting me leave campus.   5th class--Geometry. Man, I keep spelling this word wrong, I am going to need to permanetly infuse it in my brain. Geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry, geometry. Okay, I think I got it, I am going to put it in the middle of a sentence all of a--geometry--sudden. Dang! I still spelt it wrong. Gemoetry, that's how I keep spelling it. Oh well, hopefully I wont have to spell it that often. I must be slydexic. Anyways, this class should be fine.  Lunch--I failed this one last year. Actually, did you know that in some countries they actually give you a grade for this one. I'm not sure how it works, but it's either they grade you on how nutrionally you eat, or how much you socialize...not sure which.  6th period--English. Not much to say here, teacher is pretty cool, although he cusses, which is not something I like (in case you really know me).  7th--open.  8th--Biology. Not going to be that hard. It will have its ups and downs. The work is something I enjoy doing, well at least today. I like taking words apart and learning what different suffixes mean. Maybe, I can get so good at it, that I will just know what the word means before I have even heard it before. Work is easy, but it's often. Every class day we will have homework.  Well, my day was not going to well. Until I talked with Dominique on the phone. We talked about how are days went, and that was wonderful. I really like her guys. (S), you know it. If you didn't get that, you weren't supposed to. Goodnight everyone. Have good school days. Make good education. Get good job. Impruve splling, ad grmrmaar. Learn 2+2 does not equal Fish, no matter how many times you did it. If you are taking U.S. History, learn that if you answer everything George Washington, you can at least get an 'A'. Actually, don't do that, it probably won't work.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1739757,indUnk,"             I had a friend come visit me this weekend.  We met six and a half years ago in Israel.  We hadn't seen each other since, had kept up primarily through periodic phone calls.  It was so interesting, because we got along great, but in a lot of ways, I felt like I was meeting a completely new person.  There was so much I had never known about her, and I was really impressed.  There are so many dimensions to a person that it really takes major quality time to find out about.    She was really interested in a lot of the things that I have been learning about recently.  She told me she had minored in philosophy in college, I never had any idea.  She kept picking up the books that I have been reading, that all my friends have been making fun of me for reading, and she was really into them.  We had some really deep discussions this weekend about our views on religion, people and what is right.    I felt I could be really honest with her about the questions I have been thinking about lately.  We really talked things out, not that we came to any major conclusions, but it gave me a lot to think about.  I feel like I am going to be thinking about a lot of stuff for a long time.  It was good to get together with someone who isn't part of what has become my normal, extremely homogenous world.  I really like hearing other viewpoints and perspectives.  I feel like it makes me into a more well-rounded person.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1726011,indUnk,"           Another post related to the perception that our electorate is either informed or involved.  I am not familiar with the credentials of Jack Germond, but found this quote in the  urlLink Star Tribune  (it was in the print edition):   'Today, after 50 years of exposure to thousands of politicians, I am convinced that we get about what we deserve at all levels of government, up to and including the White House.  These days, because so many Americans -- almost half -- don't bother to vote even in presidential elections, they deserve choices like the one they were offered in 2000, between Al Gore and George W. Bush.  Beause so few Americans understand the political process or bother to follow it with even a modicum of attention, we elect presidents as empty as George H.W. Bush or as self-absorbed as Bill Clinton -- only to be followed by a choice between a Republican obviously over his head and a Democrat too unsure of his own persona to be convincing.'    Whom to blame for this?  Individuals for not realizing the power they truly hold, politicians for allowing our media culture to define politics in overly simplistic terms and the mainstream media for being interested only in sound bytes, controversy and skin.  Of course, the issue is far more complex than this. Institutional barriers to adequte information abound: poverty, multiple jobs and a mainstream media owned by the corporate (read conservative political) establishment, to name just a few.    I'd suggest that these three substantial institutional barriers are a direct result of neocon policies. The continued consolidation of power between the conservative political establishment and their media partners is having the insidious (and perhaps intended) effect of precluding the exercise and validity of citizen participation in our democracy; these barriers thoroughly disenfranchise an enormous portion of the American citizenry.  Sure, the neocons are part of representative government...but do they represent America?  Emphatically NO.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Perception is nine tenths of reality.   It doesn't really matter what the truth is, or what the world is like. It doesn't matter how everyone else sees reality. The 'truth' doesn't matter. The objective truth, anyways.  To the individual, its all about their perception, so it's totally warped or skewed, okay. But that's the way they see the world. And no matter how much anyone else talks, that's probably not going to change.  Just letting you know.  I know my own perception of the world is filtered.

1713442,Education,"        urlLink Class Size Reduction and Urban Students. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Wendy Schwartz.  It looks at how city students can benefit from smaller classes.  From the ERIC Digest:  Researchers have long investigated whether smaller classes improve student achievement. Their conclusions suggest that class size reduction (CSR) can result in greater in-depth coverage of subject matter by teachers, enhanced learning and stronger engagement by students, more personalized relationships between teachers and students, and safer schools with fewer discipline problems (Cohen, Miller, Stonehill, & Geddes, 2000; Hertling, Leonard, Lumsden, & Smith, 2000; Thompson & Cunningham, 2001). Thus, in 1999 Congress began appropriating funds so that schools could hire additional teachers and invest in other CSR measures. Federal CSR funds for the 2001-2 school year totaled $1.6 billion, and allocations are now included in the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (Class Size Reduction, 2002).    About half of the states have begun to reduce the size of their kindergarten through third grade classes, the grades shown to be most sensitive to the positive effects of small classes (Hertling et al., 2000). One of the main goals of CSR is closing the achievement gap between white middle-class students and poor students of color. Several states have undertaken major CSR initiatives, and these efforts have been rigorously evaluated to determine their costs and effects on students, teachers, and the education system as a whole. This digest briefly reviews recent research findings on the CSR experience and summarizes researchers recommendations for program improvements.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1713442,Education,"    urlLink Nutch  Like many, I am discouraged by the way search engines work.  Unfortunately, all of the search engines are accepting advertising money and this has lead to a more commercialized set off results for end users.  Even Google allows advertisers to bid on keywords.  The rest also allow for advertisers to buy their way into their directories.  Getting into Yahoo's directory is $299 a year.  I blogged a project today that is trying to come up with an open source non-commercial search engine.  I wish them luck.  From the site:  Nutch is a nascent effort to implement an open-source web search engine.  Web search is a basic requirement for internet navigation, yet the number of web search engines is decreasing. Today's oligopoly could soon be a monopoly, with a single company controlling nearly all web search for its commercial gain. That would not be good for users of the internet.  Nutch provides a transparent alternative to commercial web search engines. Only open source search results can be fully trusted to be without bias. (Or at least their bias is public.) All existing major search engines have proprietary ranking formulas, and will not explain why a given page ranks as it does. Additionally, some search engines determine which sites to index based on payments, rather than on the merits of the sites themselves. Nutch, on the other hand, has nothing to hide and no motive to bias its results or its crawler in any way other than to try to give each user the best results possible.  Nutch aims to enable anyone to easily and cost-effectively deploy a world-class web search engine. This is a substantial challenge. To succeed, Nutch software must be able to:  - fetch several billion pages per month  - maintain an index of these pages  - search that index up to 1000 times per second  - provide very high quality search results  - operate at minimal cost   This is a challenging proposition. If you believe in the merits of this project, please help out, either as a developer or with a donation. ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1682363,indUnk,"        Today's lesson: STOP SIGNS ARE FOR EVERYONE!   I have to say right now, I am guilty of doing the 'California Roll'  (also called by many other names).   That's when you come up to a stop sign and come to a rolling stop, then you go.  This Driving for Morons installment is not for the 'rollers', it's for the 'completely ignorers'.  So, if you blatantly ignore stop signs ... Read on!  First, what is a stop sign?  Well, it's that thing at the end of the road.  It sits on top of a metal post.  It is red, with 8 sides and says 'STOP' in the middle with great big letters.  Believe it or not, this 'sign' is there for more than you to gaze at like a piece of art.  (Note:  I do realize that stop signs and other road signs do make good art, I admit to having 'acquired' a few pieces of said art in my younger days.  But anyways ... That's another topic!)   Stop signs are at the end of roads  (and streets, lanes, etc.)  for a reason.  They are there to     get you to stop.  I would like to think that there is a reason behind almost every stop sign there is on the face of this planet.  Usually, it is because you are going to go onto another road which most likely will have other cars on it.  Now listen closely:  The  'other'  cars on that new road actually have something called the 'right of way'.  That means, you should stay out of their way!  This does not mean that you should completely ignore the stop sign and gun your way onto the next street causing other drivers to have to slam on their brakes to avoid smashing into you.  Some other things to note, the following do not give you special privileges to ignore stop signs completely: -a cell phone to your ear -an 'N' or 'L' sticker in your back window/on back bumper -having been a driver since Noah was a little boy -being old/being young -being male/being female -having a bigger vehicle -being blonde/red/brunette/gray/white/pink/etc. haired  Now I know that the proper procedure at a stop sign is:  'Come to a complete stop just before the line.  Look both ways.  If you are unable to see clearly, edge forward until you are able to do so.  Proceed once it is safe to do so.'  But I'm realistic!  The only people who actually come to a stop for a full 2-3 seconds do it because they are a) taking their driver's exam b)they are driving as a job or c)there is a cop nearby.  Do the 'California Roll' if you have too ... Just don't ignore the stop sign completely.  It's a$$holes like you that cause accidents.  Smarten the heck up!  When you approach a stop sign, slow down.  Look both ways CAREFULLY.  If there is traffic, then don't go!  It's that simple.  Well, I hope that this clears up the stop sign.  If you like my Driving for Morons series, then stay tuned for future installments including 'Brakes: Not all the @#@!# time!', 'School Zone: Duh!' and 'Cellphones: DON'T!'  Most of all,  DRIVE SAFELY!           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This post may be a little weird, I have basically been hardwired to my The Who playlist on iTunes for like two weeks straight.  That much Daltrey can ruin a man.  Anyway, here goes.  I caught some shit about bitching out on my Monday post.  I openly admit that I posted that conversation to avoid having to actually come up with something new, but it's not because I don't love doing this for (to) you, it's because I'm a lazy bastard.  So fucking get over it.  Plus that conversation was pretty funny.  As long as you're not some über pussy liberal tight-lipped prick hippie shithead.  I can't stand UPLTLPHS's.  Anyway, I do have a harrowing tale for you today.  Some may call it borrowing, plagiarism or even stealing.  I like to think of it as tasteful appropriation.  By any name it boils down to one thing: Storytime, Nick style.       Once upon a time there was a boy named Jack.  He wasn't very old, but he was a man.  Though not physically aged he was very mature.  He didn't act like a child and the other kids frowned upon this.  They had taken to calling him Jerkwad or Fignuts.  Naturally, Jack just turned the other cheek, not about to kowtow to these foolish antics.  This aloof indifference angered the other children.  More than anything they wanted a reaction from Jack, they wanted to see him fight back.  But Jack was no fighter, he was too happy to ever fight.  So one day after school Jack was walking home and a group of the other boys cornered him in the alley between Benson's Frozen Confections and Handy Dan's Hardware.  Jack knew there was no escape so he simply removed his backpack, set it aside and prepared to take his licks.  The boys pinned him down and punched him mercilessly, they hit him with sticks, they dropped things on his back and told him lies about his Mom.  Through it all Jack continued to smile.  The boys tried and tried, but they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy.  They finally got so pissed off that he was smiling while taking a beating that one of the bigger boys hit Jack in the head with a brick and killed him.  Once the other boys realized what had happened they all ran off and hid.  It wasn't too long before a passerby found Jack's lifeless corpse and called the police.  Well, the police showed up and, using forensic science, figured out what happened.  They picked up one of the boys that had been there and told him that if he didn't rat on the others they were going to go to his house get his puppy and slowly torture it to death, until he did tell them.  The boy, sensing a bluff, told them to go fuck their mothers with engorged Wapiti cocks.  Needless to say, the kindly Police Officers took exception to this comment and went to get his dog.  After about 20 minutes of watching his pup get skinned and filleted the boy was ready to turn over anyone the Police wanted, even the god-damned Easter Bunny.  The Police rounded up all the boys who had been present, tried them all as adults and sent them to a maximum security prison where they spent the rest of their days.  Meanwhile in Heaven, Jack laughed and laughed and laughed.  They couldn't prevent Jack from being happy.

1676824,Non-Profit,"       June 11, 2004  Mrs. Reagan, Patti, Michael and Ron, members of the Reagan family, distinguished guests, including our presidents and first ladies, Reverend Danforth, fellow citizens, we lost Ronald Reagan only days ago but we have missed him for a long time.  We have missed his kindly presence, that reassuring voice and the happy ending we had wished for him.   It has been 10 years since he said his own farewell, yet it is still very sad and hard to let him go.   Ronald Reagan belongs to the ages now, but we preferred it when he belonged to us.   In a life of good fortune, he valued above all the gracious gift of his wife, Nancy.  During his career, Ronald Reagan passed through a thousand crowded places, but there was only one person, he said, who could make him lonely by just leaving the room.   America honors you, Nancy, for the loyalty and love you gave this man on a wonderful journey and to that journey's end.   Today, our whole nation grieves with you and your family.   When the sun sets tonight off the coast of California and we lay to rest our 40th president, a great American story will close.   The second son of Nell and Jack Reagan first knew the world as a place of open plains, quiet streets, gas-lit rooms and carriages drawn by horse.   If you could go back to the Dixon, Illinois, of 1922, you'd find a boy of 11 reading adventure stories at the public library or running with his brother Neil along Rock River, and coming home to a little house on Hennepin Avenue.   That town was the kind of place he remembered where you prayed side by side with your neighbors.  And if things were going wrong for them, you prayed for them and knew they'd pray for you if things went wrong for you.   The Reagan family would see its share of hardship, struggle and uncertainty.   And out of that circumstance came a young man of steadiness, calm and a cheerful confidence that life would bring good things.   The qualities all of us have seen in Ronald Reagan were first spotted 70 and 80 years ago.  As the lifeguard in Lowell Park, he was the protector, keeping an eye out for trouble.   As a sports announcer on the radio, he was the friendly voice that made you see the game as he did.   As an actor he was the handsome all-American good guy, which in his case required knowing his lines and being himself.   Along the way certain convictions were formed and fixed in twe should strive to know and do the will of God.  He believed that the gentleman always does the kindest thing.  He believed that people were basically good and had the right to be free.  He believed that bigotry and prejudice were the worst things a person could be guilty of.  He believed in the golden rule and in the power of prayer. He believed that America was not just a place in the world, but the hope of the world.   And he believed in taking a break now and then, because, as we said, there's nothing better for the inside of a man than the outside of a horse.   Ronald Reagan spent decades in the film industry and in politics, fields known on occasion to change a man.  But not this man.  From Dixon to Des Moines to Hollywood to Sacramento to Washington, D.C., all who met him remembered the same sincere, honest, upright fellow.   Ronald Reagan's deepest beliefs never had much to do with fashion or convenience.  His convictions were always politely stated, affably argued, and as firm and straight as the columns of this cathedral.   There came a point in Ronald Reagan's film career when people started seeing a future beyond the movies.  The actor Robert Cummings recalled one occasion.   'I was sitting around the set with all these people and we were listening to Ronnie, quite absorbed.  I said, 'Ron, have you ever considered some day becoming president?'   'He said, 'President of what?'   ''President of the United States,' I said.   'And he said, 'What's the matter?  Don't you like my acting either?''   (LAUGHTER)   The clarity and intensity of Ronald Reagan's convictions led to speaking engagements around the country, and a new following he did not seek or expect.   He often began his speeches by saying, 'I'm going to talk about controversial things.'  And then he spoke of communist rulers as slave masters, of a government in Washington that had far overstepped its proper limits, of a time for choosing that was drawing near.   In the space of a few years, he took ideas and principles that were mainly found in journals and books and turned them into a broad, hopeful movement ready to govern.   As soon as Ronald Reagan became California's governor, observers saw a star in the west, tanned, well-tailored, in command and on his way.  In the 1960s his friend Bill Buckley wrote, 'Reagan is indisputably a part of America and he may become a part of American history.'   Ronald Reagan's moment arrived in 1980.  He came out ahead of some very good men, including one from Plains and one from Houston. What followed was one of the decisive decades of the century as the convictions that shaped the president began to shape the times.   He came to office with great hopes for America.  And more than hopes.  Like the president he had revered and once saw in person, Franklin Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan matched an optimistic temperament with bold, persistent action.   President Reagan was optimistic about the great promise of economic reform, and he acted to restore the rewards and spirit of enterprise.  He was optimistic that a strong America could advance the peace, and he acted to build the strength that mission required.   He was optimistic that liberty would thrive wherever it was planted, and he acted to defend liberty wherever it was threatened.   And Ronald Reagan believed in the power of truth in the conduct of world affairs.  When he saw evil camped across the horizon he called that evil by its name.   There were no doubters in the prisons and gulags, where dissidents spread the news, tapping to each other in code what the American president had dared to say.  There were no doubters in the shipyards and churches and secret labor meetings where brave men and women began to hear the creaking and rumbling of a collapsing empire. And there were no doubters among those who swung hammers at the hated wall that the first and hardest blow had been struck by President Ronald Reagan.   The ideology he opposed throughout his political life insisted that history was moved by impersonal tides and unalterable fates. Ronald Reagan believed instead in the courage and triumph of free men and we believe it all the more because we saw that courage in him.   As he showed what a president should be, he also showed us what a man should be.   Ronald Reagan carried himself, even in the most powerful office, with the decency and attention to small kindnesses that also define a good life.   He was a courtly, gentle and considerate man, never known to slight or embarrass others.   Many people across the country cherish letters he wrote in his own hand to family members on important occasions, to old friends dealing with sickness and loss, to strangers with questions about his days in Hollywood.   A boy once wrote to him requesting federal assistance to help clean up his bedroom.   (LAUGHTER)   The president replied that, 'Unfortunately, funds are dangerously low.'   (LAUGHTER)   He continued, 'I'm sure your mother was fully justified in proclaiming your room a disaster...   (LAUGHTER)   '... therefore you are in an excellent position to launch another volunteer program in our nation.   (LAUGHTER)   'Congratulations.'   See, our 40th president wore his title lightly, and it fit like a white Stetson.   In the end, through his belief in our country and his love for our country, he became an enduring symbol of our country.   We think of the steady stride, that tilt of the head and snap of the salute, the big screen smile, and the glint in his Irish eyes when a story came to mind.   We think of a man advancing in years with the sweetness and sincerity of a scout saying the pledge.  We think of that grave expression that sometimes came over his face, the seriousness of a man angered by injustice and frightened by nothing.   We know, as he always said, that America's best days are ahead of us.  But with Ronald Reagan's passing, some very fine days are behind us.  And that is worth our tears.   Americans saw death approach Ronald Reagan twice in a moment of violence and then in the years of departing light.  He met both with courage and grace.  In these trials, he showed how a man so enchanted by life can be at peace with life's end.   And where does that strength come from?  Where is that courage learned?  It is the faith of a boy who read the Bible with his mom. It is the faith of a man lying in an operating room who prayed for the one who shot him before he prayed for himself.  It is the faith of a man with a fearful illness who waited on the Lord to call him home.   Now death has done all that death can do, and as Ronald Wilson Reagan goes his way, we are left with the joyful hope he shared.   In his last years he saw through a glass darkly.  Now he sees his savior face to face.   And we look for that fine day when we will see him again, all weariness gone, clear of mind, strong and sure and smiling again, and the sorrow of this parting gone forever.   May God bless Ronald Reagan and the country he loved.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1645698,Student,"           Man what a day Friday was... First I hung out with the 1337 of 133757. My brother, a bunch of his friends, a bunch of his friends' friends and me (don't worry I knew all of them...infact they are kinda like my friends) went to see LOTR: The Return Of The King. The theater that we went to had the best seats ever! These things rocked, literally. They rocked back and forth. On a side note, if you guys are wondering which theater, it's the LOEWS on 34th and 7th ave. Good times. The Return of the Kings wasn't the best out of all three. I think that it has already being brought up that the movie is 3 and half hour long. My ass started to hurt by the end. But it didn't matter because it was worth all that time, besides they make sure that the movie kept you really interested. At no point did I want to yawn or turn away. The only problem that I had with the movie was that it wasn't true to the book as the others. That's probably because it was already really long, so I can't wait till the extended edition comes out and I can see the cut out scenes. Anyway After the movie, Goldberg and his friends wanted to go eat some sushi, so the rest of us followed them up a block. After realizing that the sushi place was nowhere near 34th street, we asked where he was going. The answer: 'to st.Marx's for sushi, it's half off.' That is just competely fucked up, he wanted us to go downtown to the villiage (damn villiage) so that we could get rotten raw fish, not just raw fish, but that crap that they sell for half off. Anyway we ended up going to Popeye's (yea i know it isn't that much better, but hey atleast it was close by). That was my friday!         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1620182,Technology,"                 Scott Granneman raises some excellent points in  urlLink this article, yet I feel he is missing some fundamental points.    First off, let me say that there is no debate that Windows security is a disaster.  Buy why is it a disaster?  Is it because the guys working up at  urlLink Microsoft  are idiots?   NO!!   The engineers who work at Microsoft are some of the most intelligent people in the business.  I'm tired of people acting as if Microsoft is stupid for creating all these problems in their software.  I'll tell you why they're there:  1.) Microsoft is in the business of making money.  This fact alone should give you a good idea how the Microsoft culture is different from that of the Linux community.  Linux is free.  Linux is built as a gift to the world.  Windows is built to make Bill Gates a ton of money.  2.) Microsoft is market driven.  Granneman stated this himself.  Microsoft makes decisions based on what marketing thinks will sell.  See point 1.  3.) One major marketing goal is to make the Windows operating system easy to use.  This always adds complexity that will, without a doubt, introduce bugs.  Some of those bugs will be security vulnerabilities.  Linux is not easy to use, which therefore costs its users more money to install and run, which therefore causes customers to purchase Windows, which therefore gives Microsoft a monopoly in the market.  Microsoft does not need to stop interconnecting its components.  Microsoft does not need to stop selling so many copies of their software.  Microsoft does need to inforce some security principles such as not executing files unless the user explicitly requests it...Such as fixing key common components such as Internet Explorer...or encouraging users to run with ordinary privledges.

1620073,Non-Profit,"       Last day of Winter, and looking outside, I hold little hope for the future.  Melbourne has been really windy lately.  So windy that it has starred in numerous news bulletins as a blower over of trees and a destroyer of houses and cars.  Wow.  Usually it's seen as one of the most inert of the four elements too.  My friend, who I have mentioned several times, Jeanie has a blog, but you'll never find it.  On the 10th of August she said 'Well, apparently friends don't need to speak to each other any more. THey just read each other's blogs and then you know all there is to know.'  I'd just like to say that even though I do detail here what I am doing, I do do other things too.  Like watch the Simpsons.  So if you're one of my friends reading this, you can still talk to me.  My social group has is going through a blog explosion.  There are blogs everywhere.  This is pretty cool.  I mean, part of what I like about it is that if your main communication tool to your friends is email, then typing out variations of what you have been doing is damn tedious.  Unfortunately it means that my funny anecdotes get written up here, and when I go to tell people about them, they're like, 'Yeah, I know.  I read your blog.'  I miss people laughing at them, that's all.  Anyway...   Saturday.   Watched  Rage , saw the last 15 or so songs of the top 50.  So pleased that that  Remix to Ignition * is not number one anymore.  But instead it has been replaced with that  Where is the Love  song.  Yitch!  Also saw the new Evanescence clip,  Going Under .  I knew it was them before the info came up.  There's no other gothy cute chicks about at the moment.  It was okay.  Eh.  I liked  Bring me to Life  better, it had more of an immediate impact on me.  As soon as I heard it on Nova, I knew it would be good.  * As if I am gonna run my hands through his hair!  Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!  Then, dum dum dum, I finished my Synopsis.  Victory Wiggle!  The rest of the day consisted of playing the piano, talking to Hannah, seeing David, having food.  Then I decided to go to the FOME Mask ball, instead of the video night Dave and Josh having.  So I got out a dress I wore to my 21st and got the orange and vodka stains out of it with a bit of nappy-san.  It was very impressive.  And I got it dry and everything.  I went as a Platonic Form.  I lasted for about an hour and a half.  It was really boring and the music sucked.  So I rang up Dave and they sent around my sober saviour,  urlLink Mr Bowie .

1604755,indUnk,"                 While we've been traveling, I've been picking up books here and there. World Fantasy in DC, in particular, yielded some great finds. But I've also found some interesting books recently at Tallahassee used bookstores. Herein, a list, with annotations. For most of these, I've had no chance to do more  than just skim some chapters, read some stories, in these books, but they're all on my to read pile because, well, they all look wonderful so far! So, in no particular order (just as you might find them in one of those great but frustrating New Orleans bookstores, where everything is stacked, jumbled, confused, but glorious):   Limekiller by Avram Davidson  ( urlLink Old Earth Books ) - I've just read the first two stories, but have to confirm Jonathan Strahan's enthusiastic review in Locus--these are Davidson's best stories. The introduction by Lucius Shepard is brilliant, too. The cover leaves a lot to be desired, though; in fact, I recommend you strip off the dust jacket and set it aside somewhere while reading.   Another Green World by Henry Wessells  (Temporary Culture, temporaryculture@yahoo.com) - Wessells is an antiquarian book seller from NYC who has been instrumental in helping publish much of Davidson's work posthumously. Now he's come out with a book that, quite frankly, if the  urlLink Ministry of Whimsy  hadn't been overstocked, we would have taken. These wonderfully bookish, Borgesian stories come highly recommended by Guy Davenport, William Gibson, and Michael Swanwick. If all goes well, we may offer some of these on the Ministry web site.   Floater by Lucius Shepard  ( urlLink PS Publishing ) - A cop who has just shot a Haitian immigrant in NYC experiences a floater in his eye--a stray bit of protein that occludes part of his eyesight. He begins to have visions. The shooting incident takes on new dimensions. The cop begins a downward spiral. I'm about three-fourths done with this one. Shepard is a brilliant writer, and Floater is great noir with a possible supernatural element to it.   The Angel in the Darkness by Kage Baker  ( urlLink Golden Gryphon Press ) - I'm a huge fan of Baker's Company stories and novels. However, this Company novella is of poor quality comparatively. It's more or less a slice of a larger piece, and it's dogged by too many scenes in which characters must explain plot to other characters just so the reader will understand what's going on.   Monterra's Deliciosa & Other Tales by Anna Tambour  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Tambour is a fresh and interesting voice. Although this collection is too long--the poetry and a couple of what appear to be nonfiction pieces could have been cut, along with a couple of the weaker fictions--it provides a nice overview of a writer to watch. I particularly enjoyed stories like 'Klokwerk's Heart,' 'Temptation of the Seven Scientists,' and 'Dr. Babiram's Potentials'. Tambour's offbeat stories and quietly confident prose are a delight to read. Several of these stories posit truly original situations, characters, or narratives.   Weirdmonger by D.F. Lewis  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Long overdue, Des Lewis' first comprehensive collection of idiosyncratic short fiction showcases the best of his work from 1987 to 1999.  No one writes quite like Lewis--and I can recall with some clarity how Des would include, with his submissions, a list of quotes from reviewers that ranged from raves to pans. Des has never worried much about other people's opinions, and as a result, his fiction remains unique, challenging, and, in some essential sense, timeless.   The Monsters of St. Helena by Brooks Hansen  (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux) - Hansen, who wrote the masterpiece The Chess Garden and the solid novel Pearlman's Ordeal, has finally written a dud, with this tale of Napoleon's sojourn on the island of St. Helena. From the pull-way-back introduction in which the reader gets a long-view historical brief on the island to the interesting characters to the interesting prose, Hansen has managed to waste it all on an inconsequential and utterly boring story. I've rarely seen so many potentially wonderful elements amassed for deployment...only to be deployed in such a banal and disappointing manner.   Bibliomancy by Elizabeth Hand  ( urlLink PS Publishing ) - Although her novels are good, Hand's real strength has always been at the shorter lengths, and Bibliomancy has me drooling in anticipation. The packaging is gorgeous as well, with Fitzgerald's 'The Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of' as the cover art. Lucius Shepard, who seems ubiquitous at this point, contributes an engaging introduction.   The Tyrant by Michael Cisco  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Cisco is inexplicably 'cult' to my mind, mostly because he's had one critically-acclaimed book (The Divinity Student, Buzzcity Press) followed by five years of silence...which didn't mean he wasn't busy, just that he had some difficulties with potential publishers holding on to his manuscripts for too long. Anyway, now The Tyrant is out, in another beautiful package, with cover art by Harry Morris, and it's a good novel. It starts very, very slowly--needlessly so--but once you get past the first thirty pages, there are several marvels here for the adventurous.   The Dark edited by Ellen Datlow  (Tor) - This looks to be a potential classic anthology of ghost stories, with work by Jeffrey Ford, Kelly Link, and several other great writers. I'm really looking forward to reading this one.   Wonder Tales: Six French Stories of Enchantment edited by Marina Warner  (Farrar, Straus, Giroux) - A fetching small-sized hardcover of French fairytales retranslated from the French by such writers as A.S. Byatt and John Ashbery. A beautiful package, and clever, playful writing.   Tales from the Crypto-System by Geoffrey Maloney  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Another great collection from Prime Books. Probably the best way to describe Maloney's work is to reference my own blurb on the back cover: 'At his best, Geoffrey Maloney uses the surreal in the same way as J.G. Ballard, but with his own twists.  A Maloney story is not to be trusted--it will turn on you when you least expect it, and your brain will be irrevocably altered.'   He Do The Time Police In Different Voices by David Langford  ( urlLink Cosmos Books ) - I just love David Langford's work, whether for Ansible or elsewhere. This fascinating-looking collection of parodies and pastiches (of Ellison, Herbert, Lewis Carroll, etc.) is next on my list to read.   Japanese Gothic Tales by Izumi Kyoka  (University of Hawaii Press) - Gabriel Mesa turned me on to this collection of weird Japanese stories.   Faking Literature by K.K. Ruthven  (Cambridge Press) - We picked this up in the Shakespeare library in Washington D.C. It's a collection of essays about literary fakes and frauds. So far, it is tough going but still interesting. I may not finish it--I may just skim and, er, steal from it...   Sewer, Gas, & Electric by Matt Ruff  (Aspect SF) - I've finally remembered to buy a copy of this supposed cult classic. I'm sure hoping it turns out to be good. I thought Fool on the Hill was crap (his talking animals irritated me), but thought I'd give Ruff a second chance.   Winter in Majorca by George Sand, trans. & annotated by Robert Graves  (Cassell) - Wow. We picked this up in a used bookstore two hours before we had to leave DC. I have to quote you the dustjacket copy to do the book justice: 'In 1838, George Sand arrived in Majorca with Chopin and her two children, Maurice and Solange, offspring of her marriage to Baron Dudevant. Majorca, at that time, had not fallen under the influence of the Romantics, and George Sand, arriving with Chopin, smoking cigarettes, and both she and her daughter wearing masculine clothes, caused more than a little stir. It would appear that the Majorcans made little attempt to understand her, and she little to understand them, and contact between the two was rare. After three years, the little party left the island and returned to France. Within two years, Un Hiver a Majorca was published, a book which though praising the natural beauties of Majorca, condemned the Majorcans as barbarians, thieves, monkeys, and Polynesian savages who cheat, extort, lie, abuse, and plunder, and went so far as to suggest that the majority of the inhabitants were the bastard descendants of Carthusian monks. It was a book as full of vitriol as it was of inaccuracies...but it is described by the Encyclopedia Britannica as one of the great travel books of literature, and Majorcans continue to print and sell it to visitors--without comment on its errors and slanders.' This edition contains Jose Quadrado's 'Refutation of George Sand' as well. Holy crap. I am so looking forward to this one...   Lady Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet no. 13, edited by Gavin Grant and Kelly Link  ( urlLink Small Beer Press ) - LCRW has undergone a welcome make-over with this issue, changing to perfect binding and a full-color cover. It looks classy and sophisticated without sacrificing any of its home-grown appeal. Ghosting page numbers across the middle of pages is not a great idea, but a good experiment. Some of the cutesy added stuff on the inside has by now worn thin--it begins to seem fey and smug rather than funny (think flat McSweeney's)--but there are good stories in the issue, and the magazine continues to publish new writers of interest.   Bittersweet Creek and Other Stories by Christopher Rowe  ( urlLink Small Beer Press)  - Another in the impressive series of chapbooks from Small Beer: artfully designed and chockful of good writing. I'm looking forward to this one--I very much liked Rowe's story in Trampoline.   Other Cities by Benjamin Rosenbaum  ( urlLink Small Beer Press)  - And, yes, yet another in the impressive series of chapbooks from Small Beer: artfully designed and chockful of good writing. I've read a couple of these tales, which have been compared to Calvino in Invisible Cities. To Rosenbaum's credit, they don't read like pastiche--these are actually very different from Calvino's stories, with more emotional punch, and I think Rosenbaum is definitely a writer to watch.   El Vilvoy de las Islas by Avram Davidson  (Henry Wessells, POB 43072, Upper Montclair, NJ 07043, $12) - A handsome little chapbook version of Davidson's eccentric tale. You know, I really feel for Davidson. The guy was using literary techniques, and absorbing influences, that should have made him a respected member of the literary mainstream--or at least a respected member of the fantasy community. And, sure, he was, to an extent, embraced by the fantasy community, but he deserved a heck of a lot better. So here's another little gem by Davidson. While you're reading it, just remember that there's another Davidson out there somewhere, right now, who's going to suffer the same damn fate while he or she is alive.   Argosy edited by Lou Anders and James A. Owen  ( urlLink Coppervale)  - When I first saw this magazine at WFC, I said to Lou, 'This is fucking amazing. Wow. What a fucking great looking magazine.' So far, I've only had a chance to read Jeff Ford's excellent 'A Night in the Tropics', but I'm still marveling over the great look of the publication. Two soft trade papers in a slipcase, one an exclusive novella by Michael Moorcock. Truly cool.   The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collected Essays by Harry Matthews  ( urlLink Dalkey Archive Press ) - The only American Oulipo member has a lot to say about, well, Oulipo, and a lot of other topics. I haven't read it yet, but I'm very much looking forward to it.   The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen  (Simon & Schuster) - Island biogeography in an age of extinctions. Interweaves personal observation, scientific theory, and history. Looks very interesting.   Landscape and Memory by Simon Schama  (Vintage) - A discussion of the relationship between man and nature, setting and character, in a sense. Another one I'm looking forward to...   The True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter Carey  (Knopf) - I've always had an uneasy relationship with Carey's work, but I keep trying him despite what seems a chronic unevenness in his work.   Congo Journey by Redmond O'Hanlon  (Hamish Hamilton) - I picked up this nice UK hardcover of O'Hanlon's classic in a DC bookstore. I'd lost my US hardcover, titled No Mercy, and so was very happy to find this version. Basically, O'Hanlon travels into the Congo to see the elusive pygmy elephant. While there, civil war breaks out, all of his bribes and agreements with the central government go out the window, he gets sick, and everything just goes to hell. He barely makes it out alive. One of the great, truly surreal (and funny) travel narratives of all time.   In Evil Hour by Gabriel Garcia Marquez  (Avon) - I'd never heard of this short novel by Marquez, and so was delighted to pick up a paperback of it.   3000 MPH In Every Direction At Once: Stories and Essays by Nick Mamatas  ( urlLink Prime Books ) - Boy, the sophomoric attempt at introduction-as-parody-of-introduction by Zoe Trope that opens this book is bad, bad, bad. What follows is...well, 3000 mph in every direction. There's no guiding principle at work here, nothing to tie it all together, except Mamatas' unique voice. Thankfully, he's got a strong voice and a strong writing style. Although I enjoyed the essays more than the fiction, it's a collection worth picking up.   A Right to Be Hostile: A Boondocks Treasury by Aaron McGruder  (Three Rivers Press) - Hilarious political, cultural, and societal commentary in cartoon form, with an African American slant. I only experienced five installments of this cartoon in the local paper before they pulled it, so this treasury was a god-send. More pointed and confrontational than Doonesbury without sacrificing a certain subtleness.   School for the Blind by Dennis McFarland  (Ivy Books) - I don't know why I picked this up, but it looks interesting. A man toward the end of his life returns to his home town only to find the past catching up with him. Not a thriller--it looks like a book Peter S. Beagle might have written if Beagle wasn't interested in the fantastical. Anyway, I'm hopeful...   The Russian Debutante's Handbook  by Gary Shteyngart (Riverhead Books) - Lots of hype, could be trashy, but it looks like it's alive and kicking and vivacious even if it winds up sucking.

1604072,Consulting,"           02-21-99 --Rochester, NY---    A while ago, I raised a question that had been bothering me for some time:  '* So, if Hillary is a strong woman, why is she still hanging onto Bill's coat tails, even after all this slime has pulled? All the women I know, even the ones not particularly strong, would have left a welt on Clinton's jaw, a swinging door, and a dust trail. Can it be she has other motivations for sticking by this guy? '  'Questions of Motivation' -1-13-99  Well, if the current Washington chatter is correct, we now know why, and just what her motivation is, in two words: Senator Hillary. Assuming, that is, that you trust the press. Of course, I do not. Let's first for the sake of discussion, assume that what we're hearing is true. If it is, it seems fairly easy to defeat a Hillary Clinton Senatorial candidacy by simply pointing out that this has to be the only reason that she stuck with Bill; Power of her own. Think back; She's made it clear over the years that she thinks  of herself as a kind of Co-President (the Constitution and the will of the people, and the lack of an election not withstanding) , and certainly went to great effort to make use of that crown in the little medical care fiefdom she set up for herself. She has always coveted governmental power for her own ends, and has shown this at every opportunity. It's obvious to even the most casual observer  that Hillary leaving Bill over Monica and the rest, would have removed any chance at Hillary obtaining power of a more legitimate sort for herself.  The facts suggest that she simply decided to bide her time, and use her position relative to the President's, to obtain power of her own.  If this story out of Washington is true, then this is the picture that is presented to the American people. A scheming woman, willing to parley her Husband's elections into power for herself.... something he'd never have been able to obtain on her own. And she's willing to deal with all of the bimbo eruptions to get there. Does this sound elect able to you? I'm willing to bet that it doesn't sound that way even to the majority of Democrats.  Oh, don't misunderstand; I don't doubt that there are those Democrats who take this whole thing very seriously and consider the Clintons to be the best thing that's happened to America since Karl Marx. But I'm not convinced this accounts for the majority of Democrats. Moreover, I'm not sure the Clintons do, either. This is particularly true of the district she proposes to take over; that of retiring Senator Daniel Patrick Moynahan, whose positions, (and whose district) generally are far to the right of the Clintons, and even of mainstream Democrats, as to make the prospect of Hillary moving into such a position laughable, if it were not so dangerous for Freedom in America.  (Granted that being to the left of Hillary and mainstream Democrats would be hard to do; there's not much room to their left.)  Which brings us to the more likely possibility that the whole thing ISN'T true... (Since when have the Clintons EVER employed the truth?) Well, for what purpose could this idea have been pushed by the press? Consider the timing of this little escapade. The Democrats, and particularly the White House, desperate to move the onus off of Bill being a sexual predator, and a felon, needed something to shift the focus, off of both the trial and the new events; The Dolly Kyle-Browning lawsuit, and the Broderick Rape, and subsequent White House inspired killing of the story by NBC... What better way to do so, than to create a controversy such as this?  And the thing is, to a large degree, the ruse seems to be working. At least, that is, if you trust the press.   And, as I say, I do not.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1596188,Accounting,"                 Good Morning Ladies!!  Well just woke up and turned on my tv and there is Adam.  What a thing to wake up too.  It was cute too he was talking about the California governor race and at the end Jon Scott asked Adam if he was going to run and he smiled and laughed and said no but some of the producers were thinking of throwing their name in.  He was so adorable when he smiled and laughed.  Made my day since I'm having major cramps today.  Ugh.  Well went to American Idol concert last night.   It was good but I think they sang to many slow songs.  I like when they sing the fast songs in groups.  Josh was not there.  I had read an article a week or too ago that said he didn't get enough hours in to get leave so he wasnt going to be on the tour.  That was a little disappointing.   There were lots of teenagers there and boy can they scream.  LOL  Nat - I'm glad you got the tapes, now you have to kick your hubby out of the house for a day so you can watch non stop Rick.  LOL!  My hubby won't go to concerts with me.  He can't stand the noise but he doesn't mind that I go so I have some friends that love to go with me so it always works out.  The housing prices here is one reason I want to move to North Carolina.  We love it there and you can get a nice house with land for like $175,000.  We are going to live near the city so we can work in the city to make more money.  If you find a house here for $300,000 you won't have any land.  You look out your window and the house next to you is right there.  We will just save our money for the next couple of years and when we sale our house we are going to make a huge profit since the housing market has gone up since we bought it 7 years ago.  We should be able to put a lot down on our new house and have a low payment.    Leslie - I'm so sorry to hear about your lump.  I'll pray everything goes okay.  I can feel your pain on the vet bill.   My cat was sick this past January and it cost me almost $500.00 to find out that she had a gas pocket in her intestines.   I love her to death and would spend any amount of money but it hits you hard. My hubby saw what you said about Angelina and he told me to tell you that he doesn't care that she is still a hottie.  LOL!!  Him and the guys at work have her Got Milk ad hanging in their break room at work.   The stuff I use to hear about her and Billy Bob grossed me out.  Nan - Sounds like you live in a small town like my mom.  They only have a Walmart and have to drive 45 minutes to go to a mall.   They love it.  They  moved like 2 years ago and the schools are much better for my brothers who are 15 and 14.  The schools here are over crowded and the kids don't get the attention they need.  They have improved greatly since going to smaller schools.  Jayel - I might have to check out that book.  I also like Brian Wilson.  He covered the sniper story here in Maryland so I saw a lot of him during that time.  I think he does a great job.   Yes Greg does seem more laid back the past couple days.  I have a feeling he doesn't want to come home and wants to be there when they catch Saddam since that would be a huge story.  Jen - I watch 30 Minute Meals all the time.  I love that show and she is a good host.  I also like the show she does $40.00 A Day where she goes around the country and visits cities and east for $40.00 a day.  That is pretty good too.  Jan - If they were in my town I would definitely be going down there.  I would walk by or drive by. Steve Brown is okay but if it was Jeff Goldblat or Rick or one of our other hotties then I definitely would. You could hide behind a tree across the street and take pictures.  LOL!!

I am glad that you opened your life to mine. Then after opening communications, you did something that was very brave of you. You opened your mind and then your heart. After all that you have been through in your life, I know that was not an easy thing to do. You are so special to me. I know I repeat myself about me feelings for you. The way I fell for you is so hard to actually put in to words. You are unlike any female I have ever met before, even if we have never met in person. You are shy, yet at times bold, inhibited, yet open, very cautious, and still daring. You are smart and witty. You are sexy, yet with the quality of the girl next door. You are not a false person. You are you, as I am me. You and I cannot pretend to be someone else. That is not our way. That is why I have been so open with you. Besides that, time is not on anyone’s side. None of us are getting any younger. You have given me hope again. As I hope I have given hope to you. Well my dear, I am gonna go for now. I will get back to you soon.

1586925,Banking,"       Does Jon Stewart read Max's World?  And if so, is he cherry-picking the best jokes from here to toss into his show?  The evidence, it would appear, is overwhelming.  To wit: while interviewing Curb Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin on The Daily Show this evening, Jon made a joke about a what-if Cubs-Red Sox World Series that sounded suspiciously like my blog entry from  urlLink October 16th, 2003 .  At first, I laughed it off as the sort of humorous (if obvious) observation anyone would make about the 2003 playoffs.  But once the laughter had died down I got curious, and I started digging.  What I found was a disturbing pattern of plagiarism and creative bankruptcy that Mr. Stewart has turned into a career.  See for yourself:   Jon Stewart  is the host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, a spoof of television news shows.  Remind anyone of HBO's groundbreaking 80's series Not Necessarily the News?   Jon Stewart  had a cameo role as 'Enhancement Smoker' in the 1998 stoner comedy 'Half Baked', whose story is an obviously uncredited rewrite of 'How Green was My Valley'.   Jon Stewart  was in 'Big Daddy', which was a rip-off of 'Sophie's Choice'.   Jon Stewart's  nebbishy, short Jewish intellectual shtick was done to much better effect by, you guessed it, comedian/actor Richard Pryor.  And the list goes on and on.  Jon, I'm not asking you to repudiate your entire career.  Who can forget your work on MTV's 'You Wrote It, You Watch It', or your star turn as a man with a bad haircut in 'Death to Smoochy'?  I only ask for the credit due to me as an artist.  And for a small fee I'll even keep quiet about 'Playing by Heart'.  You know what I mean.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1578617,Communications-Media,"       I find it interesting to note how the commercial mainstream tries to trivialise  urlLink Vance Packard   by saddling him with a term like 'pop-sociologist'.   His book, The Hidden Persuaders, is not a work of social science scholarship at all - examine it in that light, and it falls apart. Too anecdotal, too subjective. What it is, is a knowledgable, concerned person's report on a distressing trend towards mass manipulation that began in the US and, like other American products, has spread to the rest of the world courtsey globalisation.   Although Packard slips into excessive paranoia now and then with his 1984 allusions, and overrates the efficacy of the 'hidden persuaders' methods (half a century later, they still haven't got it quite right, though they are much slicker now), he isn't that far from the truth. Although he wrote in the '50s his core message is still all too applicable.  He offers no solutions to address the ills he speaks about. That, like academic precision was not his aim, obviously. Packard's role was/is as a signpost, making us aware of several realities of today's media/political/corporate culture, leaving it to us to decide how to deal. In a world where knowledge itself is a a precious commodity, that is a sterling service.      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1578617,Communications-Media,"       It's getting along reasonably well, I think. Yesterday, I manged to keep off most of the day. However, I copped a couple of drags off a friend at around 6.30 pm. I find it's a little hard to resist a smoke when I'm sitting around in a cafe - the whole setting has become a deeply ingrained context for lighting up. So that's something to keep in mind. Sunday I chickened out totally and bought a cigarette. Then I chucked it away after two drags. Through the day I've taken a couple of drags from friends' cigarettes - I need to be a little more careful about that.   Physical effects seem insignificant as yet - no constipation or anything, but there is a mild feeling of acidity which may not be related. More than anything else, I'm beginning to realise how smoking had become a tool for spending and even allocating time, and also a way to partially distance myself from a lot of things - a smokescreen in every sense of the word. That will be the hardest to deal with.   Still, I figure I should be able to kick this. After all, I've been able to drastically cut down both alcohol and sweet leaf. In fact, I think I've more or less stopped actively wanting to drink - instead, as and when friends decide to have a drink, I either join them or not. I've even said no to a spliff many times in the recent past. All this is just an attempt to re-assure myself that I can do this. Well, that's enough of that for now.      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1549103,Technology,"        I've only been out of the state for a month and a half now, but I do get nostalgic for the absurdities and quirks of Utah culture.  I can usually get my fix by reading the  urlLink opinion section  of BYU's  urlLink student newspaper , but that appears to have tapered off for the summer.  Luckily, David Pogue at the  urlLink New York Times  brought me this story about the Utah-based company  urlLink ClearPlay  which is offering a DVD player that cleans up Hollywood's act: Its scene-cutting technology, called ClearPlay, comes from a Utah company of the same name. Its executives maintain that by sanitizing movies, they're actually doing Hollywood a favor by building a broader audience.   Hollywood begs to differ. Actually, it sues to differ...  Hah!  Of course this whole controversy has been going for a while - stores such as  urlLink CleanFlicks , which are wildly successful in Utah, have been selling chopped versions of Titanic and Saving Private Ryan for ages now, and despite protests of directors, I'm pretty sure it's still legal for them to do so.   I am somewhat torn on the issue, being both a lover of movies and an advocate of fair use rights.  If I wanted to make a filter that would do the opposite of ClearPlay (call it FoulPlay!) and only view the naughty bits of my favorite DVDs that I have legally purchased, it should be my right to do so.  So my attitude towards these editing services and technologies is like that of a Catholic towards abortion:  I believe they are morally abhorrent, but should remain legal.    P.S.  - Exploring the CleanFlicks  urlLink site  sorely makes me want to change my stance.  They are offering The Godfather (so I guess nothing is sacred), and Kill Bill Vol. 1 (haven't seen it, but from what I've heard, it sounds like editing out the violence will not leave much).   The stupid thing about offering edited versions of these films, as Pogue points out, is that they were not intended for children, and no amount of snipping will make them so.  CleanFlicks and their ilk are catering to adults who want to infantilize themselves, and have someone protect them from the big bad scary world of 'fuck' and breasts, and help them feel assured that they will still go to heaven since they have still never defiled themselves with a rated-R movie.   Movies are rated R because they are for grown-ups.  Don't watch them if you're not one.    P.P.S.  - That's why I shouldn't read about this topic, because it makes me angry.

1538911,indUnk,"       In all honesty, the longer I do this diet, the easier it really gets.  I broke down and ordered the book yesterday (that's what I was doing over at Amazon when I got all into the wish list thing), so I'll finally have a clue what I'm supposed to be doing in the long haul.  I did find out I can substitute the oatmeal with whole-grain cereal, so that at least is a good thing.  Oatmeal's great, but how much of it can you eat if you don't like it to begin with?  So I spent some time in contemplation today in the cereal aisle and came up with some Kashi cereal that has like 9 grams of protein and 10 grams of fiber (and 1 gram of fat) per serving.  So maybe I can switch off day to day.  I bought myself some spinach salad too, so that will be a little bit of a change from the ordinary as well.  To make my life easier I decided that rather than deal with ALL of the weight I want to lose at once, I'm going to break it down into manageable pieces.  So for the time being, my weight-loss goal is 20 lbs, and I have 15.5 to go to meet that goal (as of today). I think I can do that.  Once I get to that goal, it'll be time for a reward.  I think what I'm going to do is hold off on that second piercing until then, and use it for a reward, and then I can re-evaluate and reset my goals again.  And just go on from there.  Seriously, I don't think it's good for me mentally to do it any other way.  It's like when you have to work four in a row-you can't think about it that way.  You have to concentrate on just twelve hours at a time, otherwise you'll be totally depressed the whole time.  Or when you give up drinking (something else I also have personal experience with), everyone knows that in AA you do it one day at a time.  Or one hour, or one minute if necessary.  You can't think about it in terms of a lifetime, or the enormity of it will kill you.  Probably the most difficult thing is exercising.  I just don't like it.  Who does?  Oh yes, I'm sure there are some freaks out there who just can't wait to go burn calories, but let's face it, folks, I'm basically a turtle.  So I will do whatever little I can every day on the stepper, whatever little bit that amounts to be, and call it good.  Eventually I'm sure the little bit will be a bigger bit.  I'm not going to get myself all fanatical about it and I refuse to beat myself up over it.  Realistically, I'm looking at a year to do what I want to do.  Optimistically, nine months.  Either way, it's all good.  I've known some folks who have had that gastric bypass operation, some with really good results and some with really catastrophic results.  For a while I was interested in having it done, but insurance companies don't like to pay for it, it costs a lot of money, and the thought of going forever without a diet Coke was kind of an ultimate sacrifice to me.  Did you know that once you have that operation you can never have carbonated drinks again?  Anyway, it really is a dangerous procedure, but the results can be stellar.  I'll be honest and admit I was jealous watching people lose 90-110 lbs after having it done.  On the other hand, there's a lot of things they can't do henceforth, and I don't know that I'd want to deal with that.  So either way, here I am, and not getting any bypass done, but trying myself to handle this problem.  I've been dealing with it literally my whole life, and I'm really hoping that this will be the answer this time.  I was getting myself into that mindset of 'when I've lost all this weight, I'm going to..' and I don't even want to go that far yet.. I just want to deal with this rationally, realistically, and consistently, until I get to where I need to be.  And my ultimate goal is a realistic one (I admit I also have a secret goal that is absolutely unrealistic, too), so hopefully everything will work out for the best.  All encouragement, motivational comments and etc. are appreciated.  Leave me a good word, will you?!   urlLink              ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1538911,indUnk,"       One of the hardest things about working nights is knowing what day it is.  Before you put this off as me just being a fruitcake, think about this: I go to work on one day and come home on another.   That being said, today's Wednesday.  The general plan of the day for today is for me to get some tires put on my car.  After that, we're going to the bank and FINALLY (after about six years of procrastination) getting Scott's name put on the checking account.  Don't ask.  It's a long story.  I also have to make a few phone calls for house stuff.  Tomorrow we have to go to the lawyer's and sign off the paperwork.  The buyers were around last night and everything is still looking like it's a go.  I just want it all to be done, already.  I'm really looking forward to the whole house-building process.  It's so much fun, and this time it will be even better than the first time we did it.  Scott's excited too, and he's already planning furniture and stuff he wants to build.  We are both really psyched to get out of Wilmington.  Choosing a property of the several we have on our list will probably be the most difficult decision we have left.  Between the two of us, we have the whole house basically planned out.  I've always had a huge problem with nursing uniforms.  They aren't made to fit me and the fabrics are too thin.  Additionally, I don't like straight skirts, and the skirts themselves are never the right length.  For about the last year or so I've been trying to find someone to make me some dresses.  I even bought some patterns, but I haven't gotten around to actually making anything (not to mention my sewing skills are a shade over mediocre at best.. I can make a nice apron, but a dress won't be nearly as good).  Anyway, I finally found a very nice lady who is going to make me some uniform dresses.  I have to buy them one at a time because I'm budgeting myself rather strictly these days, but I am looking forward to getting a few.  I so prefer to wear dresses anyway, and patients/families really do respond better to a nurse who looks more traditional.  If you'd like to see her website, it's  urlLink here .  Yes.  Remember I said I couldn't be stereotyped?  The humidity's dropped by about 35% in the last 36 hours.  Yesterday we had typical 'day after a hurricane' weather, with a huge drop in the humidity, blue skies, and a beautiful breeze.  The Atlantic is heating up, though, so it isn't nearly over yet.

While I was walking up the stiars, I met Mrs Chew. She told me, 'Kelvin Yip! No chance for you! You lost your chance already. Your choir teachers talked to me. So, you can't get excellent. Never mind la. Very good is good already!' When she told me this, three thoughts came to my mind. First, when she said 'No chance for you', I was like thinking 'What? What? What did I do?'. then she said 'Your choir teachers talked to me', I was like 'Oh my! Did they tell Chew what i said in my testimonial is wrong?' Then she said 'A very good is good already', I knew it was my conduct grade lor. Oh well. I was kinda dissappointed for a while, and went on blaming the choir teachers. But then i realized something. Mrs Chew worked hard to get me an excellent grade. I should be very grateful and thankful to her. And being nominated for excellent is a reconginition. I am very happy liao lor. At least I am being nominated and Mrs Chew is trying to get me get excellent. Yeah! :)  After that, there is this photo-taking thingy for the whole class. Two major events happened. One is the omission of 'Kelvin' in my name! Now, that is an insult, to me, to my memory and to my exsistence. I hastened to write my real name down there. But! However! I was stopped by Janet and Shuet Ling (with a few glares and threatens). I didn't get to write my name down. I got damned pissed off. The more I think about it, the more angry I got. They told me to tell the person in charge. I don't want to bother him. What if he glares at me? What if he dismiss me off? Then I will get nothing accomplished. Besides, I got too used to the inefficient administration regarding my name (the only time when it was effective was when Mrs Chua and Mrs Chew helped me to put 'kelvin' there in my name for O Level. Thank you, both of you!). I rather do it myself. So, I asked Mrs Chew, who was standing nearby, for a pen. She knew right away I wanted to add 'Kelvin'. HaHa! And Arman also made changes to his name (or rather. his father's). After I wrote my name, I felt immensely statisfied with myself. For adding Kelvin there, and for 'defying Janet's and SL's wishes'. Woah! I felt so shuang and happy. The other major event is that during the informal shoot, I rushed down in front of Mrs Chew's and kneeled there. The class was like shouting for KY to go down there in front of Mrs Chew and I thought it sounded like fun! So I rushed down there. And the 4/4 ppl watching applauded and whistled. HaHa! Crazy! I ordered both photos (formal and informal).   Another major event is the history mock exam. That exam took us by surprise! None of our predicted topics came up. Ah Ji and me were like studying the fall of communism topic, but it didn't come up. Neither did Germany. It was a 'worst-case scenario' paper. And Jalil said it's a possibility. Ahh! I did the source-based first. It was quite easy la. The topic was the fall of ciommunism. That chapter we studied upon. At least I had lots of background info. For the SEQ, i did the topic on 'World War 2 in the Pacific'. HaHa! That was quite easy. I studied that yesterday, using the notes and worksheets ( a pathetic few....). Actually, it was only the marking scheme for Mid-Year paper 2003. Mrs Jalil was quite right after all. Study her marking scheme only. Ha! I think I can do well. Definitely above 30. Yeah.   Today is Sabrina's last episode. And in my opinion, it was simply the best! Sabrina was supposedly to be marrying Aaron tofay. She got cold feet, and have a lot of doubts in her. Whether Aaron is her soulmate or not. Their soulstones don't match. Really. While she was making her vows, she said, 'I, Sabrina Spellman, agree to marry Aaron, my.....my...my...' She can't say the word 'soulmate' out. Both of them had a talk. They agreed to cancel off the wedding, because Sab isn't gonna be happy. She ran out of the church, and met Harvey. Harvey was waiting for her, to get some answers on his soulstone. She ran towards him, and both of them kissed. Their soulstones fell out, and it was a perfect match. Sabrin and Harvey. Everyone came out, and appluaded them. Sabrina went away with Harvey in his bike. This is such a perfect ending (therefore, we doubt there would be further episodes of Sabrina). I always wanted to see Harvey and Sabrina together. This is so sweet, so romantic, and so right! You know, Sabrina has taught me a lot of life lessons. A lot lor. I am really attrached to Sabrina. I will really miss Sab. I really will!    We brought Arman's prezzie today. What a cute jigsaw! I can't wait to assemble it!  And oh yes. I am going to Wendy's tomorrow to teach her A-Maths. I hope I make a good tutor. And I hope she understands. Yeah. That's the most important. Yeah. I am tired now. I gotta go le.....see ya tomrrow, blog! Goodnight!     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1516660,Student,"       Okay testing testing one two three. YaY! Can made this into a draft, which means that if I closed the window accidentally, this whole post can be saved. And I can change the date of posting. Oh...cool features!   Ahh...yes. Coming to today's events. I woke up at 8.30 in the morning and took a bath. After the 20-minute bath (oh! improvement....or not?), I went online while waiting for Mom to buy breakfast (fried carrot cake. I ate that 2 days in a row!). While online, someone went online. Why I want to tell you leh? Everyone comes online. But ehh....this person is KWQ, who had blocked and deleted me from his contact list. Why did he add me back on again? Now I am utterly confused. Does he want to talk or what? Why, oh why, did he add me back? I was doing fine you know....until he came online and threw me into utter confusion. I don't know whether this is good, or bad. There are some good (obviously.....), but there are some bad too. Er. I am 'one confused cat'.  Okay, after breakfast, I watched cartoons. So many cartoons on Saturday! After cartoon-watching I went to cut my hair. Oh! I was so hoping for a nice barber. Nice defines into 'not rough, not crude and not insulting'. I have enough of barbers saying something about my height! The boss ar, recongized my mother and me! BUT! BUT! He thinks I am the youngest and asked where 'my older brother' is! And Mom didn't straighten that misbelief! The barber I had was okay, but he was very meticulous. Very zi xi...go through every detail. And the way he uses the cutting thingy, like so scared like that. I think he's a newbie la. But it was boring watching him being so careful. HaHa!   After that, I came home, washed my hair twice (it's been a habit to shampoo my hair twice after a haircut....yeah!) and ate lunch. After eating lunch, I went for Wendy's house to study for Sci Prac and tuiton her. But first, we are meeting in Popular to buy our CD-R to burn songs.   I went out at 1.30 and took 913 to Admiralty Station. Met Wendy in Popular where we brought the 10 CDs. My mother lent me her Popular card to use, so we got 10% discount ($1). We used that $1 to buy two ice-cream cones from Macdonalds. We then walked back to Wendy's house.   We completed our studies for Science practicals. Well, actually, I did. Wendy seems quite unsure of her work, so I am teaching her tomorrow. After that, we are burning our CDs. YaY! Can finally have more CDs to listen to, instead of listening to Jay all the time. No no...not saying that Jay is lousy...but it does get boring after a while. Okay, after studying, we spent time reading books. She read her Condor Heroes book while I read the Teen Witch book. Then, we went out to watch her eldest brother play FFIX. He tuaght me a few tricks....ahh! Must remember ar!  We went down to buy food and drinks back for her brother. She wanted to get the Sour Cream and Onion Pringles, but I don't want. She insisted, and I let her buy. Hey! It's her brother's money after all! We then brought Roller-Coasters, some chips and Vanilla Coke.   Back there, I ate the Pringles. Can you believe it? I tred into 'forbidden' terriotry! It's not so bad after all! I almost ate half of the chips there! I watched her brother level up his characters (he's trying so hard to find the turtle monsters to level up - we call it 'wu gui wang ba'! HAHA!). Wendy called WanXin because WX smsed her. No no...cannot disclose what they are talking about. Privacy rights being invoked here! But I do realised that Wendy really makes a good psychologist! So expert in this kind of stuff...giving advice ar and all that. Woah! Her advices were practical and straightforward, and it is the best policy for everyone. Right Wendy? HaHa!  After her call, Wendy wanted to Chocobo Race with me! HaHa! You can say that this master lost every race to his student! She used the Bahamut wor! So expert sia! White Mage is naturally slow against Bahamut, but hey! At least I come in 2nd/3rd! Once, i used Bahamut, but I still lost! Sigh! But never mind lor! See the student I taught! So good at her games! This means that the teacher is REALLY SOMETHING to begin with! A-ha! Good teacher naturally produces good students ma! HaHaHa! So, no losses for me la! I am proud of my student ar!   Okay, after that came back, bathed and ate dinner while watching Simpsons. Then, came online and gave Wendy my mp3s that I wanted to burn tomorrow. Wendy recieved her present from her angel also ar! Her angel really creative, creating another email add to send her a poem. That's cool! She thought it was me, becuase the poem sound like me. HaHa! I find that hor, everytime she reads a poem. she thinks it's my work. I think she read too much of my work! HaHa! She says she's decorating the poem and printing it out (okay, I print for her).   Okay, I think i am ending this le. See ya tomorrow! Goodnight blog!     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1512157,indUnk,"       no need to worry, i shall tell now of yesterday's happenings:  life is just great. why? it’s just peach keen. HA! if only I could say that in a non-sarcastic way.  I go to dinner… everything seems fine until they start talking. Two ppl yelling in my ear until I put down my food and go to my room. I can’t sleep. my mom yells at me to finish my food. so I go downstairs again… I don’t know who to listen to, my dad who thinks I have a disease b/c I never speak to him, or my mom, who searched through my room while I was conveniently taking my English final at school. what a life. they keep on talking, both unaware of each other and of me; they don’t see I’ve begun crying. maybe they ignore be b/c they see it as normal. it’s a daily occurrence.  so basically after what seemed like forever of yelling back and forth, they come to this conclusion: 1) i can no longer associate w/ any guys 2) my dad has threatened to call the police if rags calls the house again -_-  and that's all that you will ever need to know about that  today's events: -woke up at 10-ish -got call from jane at 10:50 telling me to meet her and zuhair at borders at 11:30 -go to borders, and get debate definitions from the comm apps book, while david and zuhair do geog (lmao throughout, cuz jane makes me high... hehe) -finds out i'm not the only one w/ crazy azn parents: david's mom hears jane and me talking in the background when he calls her and comes to pick him up -_- -goes to little myako's for lunch (beef teriyaki bowl! i think they cheaped us out though. those slick japanese!) -had interesting convos w/ rags, abe, jason, and kyle about 'sensitive issues' haha it was fun! -stopped by bridesmart to look at the ugly dress they have in the display. just as we were about to charge in and demand to see the other prettier one, we discover that they had closed 30 min earlier! arg!!! *gasp*) -went to smoothie king during a deluge of calls from rags... hehe it almost got to the point that the ringer tune was constant (you WILL learn how to dance! and will NOT become a truck!) -returns to borders and decides jane wants her bridal registry there, just so she can look at those cookbooks (i must admit, there were some pretty awesome ones! ^_^) -went home and typed up my debate stuff to send to ppl -update pics (they finally work!!!):  urlLink My Pics!   sorry (you know who you are) i only wish i could take those words back somehow. to repair the damage i've caused.

1509245,indUnk,"       I have had an amazingly introspective, deliciously angsty night. My brother, who is older than me and therefore wiser in a way I will never understand, drove me downtown. It was raining in the sort of way that you might forget it is raining if you aren't looking hard enough. The raindrops stuck to the Subaru, too beautiful and important to slide off. They blurred the painful lights of the wannabe city.  It was one of those rare times that I didn't mind that the Repeat button was stuck and that the same song kept singing to me. I listen to the same songs over and over again, anyways. I like to know songs. I like to understand them. Sometimes I can forget or not listen hard enough and I will find out that there is something I missed.  I felt infinite, because a book told me I was.  I just pretty much thought about why I am. I thought about all my friends and the ones I've lost. Which is weird because then I came home and Meghan called. And this only made me sadder because we have nothing to talk about anymore. I was too tired to pretend to understand her, because I don't, just like she doesn't understand me. What ever happened to the times when listening to the Top 40 and playing with our dolls (even though we knew we were too old to) sufficed as a best friendship?   And then I sort of crawled into a teeny corner of depression where I felt sad and lonely and detached. But it was strange because I felt like this was all so eventual, so long-time-coming. I felt hapless and hopeful and nostalgic for listening to Backstreet Boys in agreement and watching Zoog Disney. And I cried a little, and then felt dumb for crying, so I cried some more.

1498713,Non-Profit,"    On Death and Dying   by Elzabeth Kbler-Ross:  This book was very informative and interesting. It takes us through the 5 stages (or 5 responses, if stages seem to concrete to you) that people seem to experience when they are dying. The book has a lot of interviews with patients and their family members, and we also get the perspective of those who are taking care of these 'dying' people, such as physicians, nurses, the chaplain, etc. Even though this book is three decades old it is still very applicable.     The Last Precinct   by Patricia Cornwell:  My sister got me hooked on Patricia Cornwell novels and the main character, Kay Scarpetta. Once again, this author did not let me down. Kay Scarpetta, Chief Medical Examiner, gets caught up in a real pickle and has to fight to clear her own name (after she is almost murdered by Jean Baptiste Chandonne, Le Loup Garou). While all of this is going on, two tortured corpses are found by the police. The murders bear all the hallmarks of the work of serial killer Jean Baptiste Chandonne. There's just one problem: Chandonne is in prison. It looks like Scarpetta has a copycat killer on her hands. If you like writers like James Patterson, you'll LOVE Patricia Cornwell.     Gather Together in my Name   by Maya Angelou:  This is the second volume of Angelou's memoirs, and thus the follow-up to  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.  This volume was just as wonderful as the first one.&nbsp;We enter young adulthood with Maya Angelou, who is now a single mother. She has a myriad of jobs, from being a madam to actually turning tricks herself. It is amazing and beautiful, at the same time, to see her honesty in exposing herself and her life to the whole world. She is, undoubtedly, a very proud, strong, and brave woman!      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, my personal definition and opinion is that multiculturalism is racism in a politically-correct guise. It holds that an individual’s identity and personal worth are determined by ethnic/racial membership and that all cultures are of equal worth, regardless of their moral views or how they treat people. Multiculturalism holds that ethnic identity should be a central factor in educational and social policy decisions. Multiculturalism would turn this country into a collection of separatist groups competing with each other for power. So what do you think?    Jon G.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1476382,Publishing,"        A Short Defense of Michael Wolff   I thought  Stephen Metcalf's   urlLink brutal Observer Book review  -- and I don't think I am going overboard in saying it -- was more about Michael Wolff than the book he wrote.   One line in particular kind of pissed me off. It purports to unravel Wolff's entire philosophy of life at one sitting:  'Messrs.  Diller and Murdoch  are at the top. Poets are at the bottom. (Mr. Wolff makes a big deal out of his status as a parent. One wonders what its like to grow up in a household where the prevailing sentiment is, 'What clear-eyed person would want to be a poet?') In between lies everyone Mr. Wolff condescends to. 'I had to summon my energy to want to talk to them.''  Well, I consider the Bloggers the poets of the media world -- we are certainly not Barry Diller. We of the creative and fertile mind waiting to get a shot at the big leagues,  Elizabeth Spiers  is our patron saint. Michael Wolff has always answered my emails and showed me the highest respect over the years. Metcalf's article struck me as pretty personal for a book review, even in the snarky precincts of the New York media game.  Stephen Metcalf's feelings towards Wolff's style interfered in his review.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1474573,Student,"                 I just got a phonecall today from one of my creditors and I basically got reamed out by this asshole who called me a loser who couldn't get a job and found my lack of ability to pay my debt offensive.  I told him that luring 18 yr olds with credit cards and 20% interest is offensive. My 500 dollar debt has turned into 1200 dollars in interest alone. I haven't used a credit card in almost 3 years. I cut them up. In fact they've stopped sending me bills. The LITTLE money that I DO make goes towards paying them off and this one is one THEY just started calling me about. Honestly? I can't even REMEMBER having this card. Yeah Im a financial mess, usually something that I'd be to ashamed about to even mention but then I think about what got me into this mess. ,  I had paid off all my debt before moving to nyc anticipating a cushy job at AOL TIME WARNER well 9/11 killed THAT idea and the only thing I could do while going to school was waitress and bartend,but now I had an apartment and food/bills and I was not about to quit a school I had worked so hard to get into, so  I spent several months basically living on my credit cards. Long gone are the part time jobs with tuition re imbersment, medical and flexible hours. So I've always been semi employed just enough to pay for school and food and I've paid off most of  my bills so when I got this call, it was uncalled for. I'm sick of creditors calling me. I talk to them, tell them my situation and pay them when I get money, but is there no recourse for this kind of harassment? Can they call me up and start yelling at me and berating me?  I'm like FUCK  YOU MOTHERFUCKING ASSHOLE! IM DOING THE BEST I CAN YOU FUCKER!

1470319,Museums-Libraries,"             OK- General Opinion Poll:  Picture this- Let's say that your significant other is very unhappy with their career. Their job is good, they make good money- but it doesn't challenge them or spark their creativity at all. Let's say that they can go back to school, but will have to get a 2nd Bachelors to be able to do what they want to do. While planning a wedding, trying to buy a house and considering kids in the next year and a half or so- how much would this stress you out?   I'm 100% supportive of the idea of Marshall going back to school for what he wants, but what it all means is what scares me. Another $25,000 or so of school debt  (though his credit card debt is non-existant). Then most definitely having to move after he's done- there are NO jobs in this field in Indiana, the closest would be Chicago, but that's still a longshot. We'd probably be looking at San Jose/Bay Area or Dallas. I realize this isn't probably for another 4 years or so- but we decided last night that Marshall may start back to school in January. I told him that as long as it's after the wedding, and that we buy a house first so that our money isn't still being wasted on rent- I'm behind him. I don't think I ever saw someone so happy and in the moment. It was cool. He can get a degree from the School of New Media at IUPUI with a specialization in Game Design which is what he wants to do. He could also do it at ITT Tech. The decision will probably be contingent on if he could do it with night school and weekend classes at IUPUI. Because he will keep his well-paying job at SBC while going to school.   Just wanted to share- interested to hear your feedback- I'm happy for him but stressed too....such is life..

1466700,Arts,"       Dear Friends,   You know that movie with that guy and that girl.  They don't like each other in the begining.  Heck they don't even know each other but, then certain things happen.  Some call it luck.  Others call it coincidence.  Some people actually think that those instances were meant to be.  You can always remember this movie because something always goes wrong and it looks like the two aren't gonna make it.  Then it happens....Magically...Love fights through the mess and they come together at the end of the movie.....smiling......holding hands.  He slides his fingers through her hair and gently leans her head to the side and moves in for the kiss.    Blackness...  Then the credits role.    You know that movie?  Well I am here to tell you what happens if that movie didn't stop there.  If the story didn't end there.  If the climax didn't occur.  Because, well that's what real life is.  In real life you can have love stories you just have to remember that the work doesn't ever end.  Let's go back to our movie:    The man (Let's call him Boris) probably was a simply guy.  Didn't like to have to think very much.  But, when he met his co-star (Noris {Bet you thought I was gonna say Natasha}) he noticed something about her that peaked his interest.  She was confusing to all Hell!  It's ok though because Boris loved challenges and was going to win her heart no matter what.  So the entire movie Boris works hard to acheive his goal and in the end he finally does.  Noris falls madly in love with him and they kiss.    Now what?    What happens now?  Do you stay in that state of floating through the clouds?  We are naive if we believe that garbage.   Anyone that's been in any relationship knows that it's not all fun and games.  It's not the finish line.  The gun just went off.  Boris didn't win.  The only thing that happend at the end of that movie was Noris qualified him for the race.  She subsituted him into the game.  That game is going to last his entire life.  He will be running that race for ever.  The only way that out is to quit.  Is to stop.  Sure there is gonna be potholes along the way.  It might rain.  It might snow.  It might hail.  The devil might come up from the pits of hell and unleash terror upon the empty souls that embrace their little lives filled with idolotry and sin.......and I know if that happens two things will always hold true.....  1.  Schools in Chicago will still be in session  and more importantly It would be worth the terror because I....I mean..um..Boris....is simply in the race.  And he is gonna run his hardest from now on.    Love you guys.   Papa D    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you areconcerned about theissue of immigration backlogs, please attend the press conference today at noon! This event will be held at the Somali Community Center, on 201 Thompson lane, Suite 202 in Nashville.Thank you!  - David Lubell  TIRRC      http://tennessean.com/local/archives/04/02/47583283.shtml?Element_ID=47583283    By ANITA WADHWANI Staff Writer  On today's one-year anniversary of the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, immigrant groups in Nashville and across the country are asking that the agency's ''major flaws'' be corrected.  The mammoth department created last year, with 180,000 on its payroll, absorbed the former Immigration and Naturalization Service along with new post-Sept. 11, 2001, national security operations.  ''The complaints we've heard about immigration processing have only gone up since the creation of USCIS,'' said David Lubell of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refuge Rights Coalition. Lubell was referring to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the arm of Homeland Security that is devoted to immigrants seeking benefits such as citizenship or legal permanent residence.  Lubell said the USCIS had inherited many of its problems from the former INS and has made them worse. The problems include longer waits for processing citizenship requests and plans to increase fees for services, Lubell said.  Related story.  Not everyone is upset over the changes, however.  The backlog in applications are ''good indicators right here that we're taking in more legal immigrants than we can possibly keep up with,'' said Donna Locke of Tennesseans for Immigration Control and Reform.  The number of applications waiting for approval by the USCIS have jumped about 60% in the past year, according to a report by the General Accounting Office released last month.  There were 6.2 million applications for people wanting to become citizens, permanent residents, or seeking some other immigration status by the end of September, compared with 3.9 million two years earlier, according to the report.  In addition, the agency has proposed increasing application fees for immigration paperwork by about $55 per application.  Immigrant advocates in at least nine other cities are planning events to highlight the Department of Homeland Security anniversary, Lubell said.

Jim Cooper's office.  At least four new ''citizenship interviewers'' will begin working out of Nashville, said Greg Hinote, Cooper's chief of staff. At least four others will beef up the staff in the Memphis office, the only existing immigration service office in the state.  The effort to establish a federal immigration office in Nashville has been going on for more than a decade, according to congressional staff members and immigration lawyers.  The Nashville area is home to more immigrants than any other part of the state. Currently immigrants living in Nashville  or anywhere else in the state  drive to Memphis to do business with the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services.  The Memphis service is understaffed and overwhelmed by the number of people it has to work with every day, immigrant advocates say.  Cooper, along with Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bill Frist, have met with USCIS officials for several months to negotiate for the new personnel, Hinote said.   Anita Wadhwani           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I did manage to learn a lot about business, myself, and the street system of greater Phoenix.   One of the main things I learned from this was how inefficient it was. The company that I was selling for had guidelines about the size of office I could and could not sell to. So a lot of my time was spent figuring out that a business didn't qualify. This was my first lesson in advertising and marketing, well first among many, but it fits into this column well.  I witnessed first hand how much more efficient it was to put together a targeted advertising campaign. With advertising you can print up a few thousand catalogs or flyers and send them to businesses that you want to sell to (this is why the yellow pages are there). The problem is that advertisers spend too much time thinking about selling their product, and not enough selling their product to someone.  Example: I sell three panel 14 pt legal folders.   As an advertiser I am thinking about how many of these I need to sell at such and such a price in order to make a profit. It is strictly numbers to me because I have never even met my buyers. I focus my ads on price and how great my price is. Problem with this is what all salespeople already know 'People don't buy on price'. You can have the cheapest folders in the world but if I don't know what I want them for then why would I buy them, even if they are the 'cheapest'.  As a salesperson I am thinking inside of my buyers head, which is easier for me because I am already talking to them. I am thinking of the various places that need those types of folders, and when I do I realize that there aren't that many. I am going to focus primarily on lawyers offices, and mortgage and title companies. Then I am going to focus on a problem they all have: folders that tear at the seam. Now I have my audience and I have my bait. I put together an ad with the bait right up front and juicy and the I toss my line into the lake that wants that bait.  Only problem now is I need a bigger insides sales office to handle all the calls, or I can get a website to handle it, but all that is for a different blog...  This leads me into ' urlLink commodification ' and the travesty of a sinkhole that that mindset can put you into.               urlLink Read more!                 ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1432406,indUnk,"       Quoting Rebecca:  '3. If being an independent wasn't so useless and limiting, I think I would be one.'  Maybe a correct revision of this statement would read as follows:  'If independents in America weren't so insecure and cowardly, they might have power.'  How many other people feel exactly the same way you do, Bec?  How many other people would vote independently and break out of the supposedly inescapable bipartisan system if they knew they were supported by a multitude (plethora, menagerie- Just for Kelly so she still reads the RG) of like-minded people?  It was said about slavery, ecological conservation, and SpongeBob Squarepants that it begins with one person, one voice, one small viral cell among millions of white t-cells.  What has this theory brought to our country?  Slavery is now abolished, though it was said that it could never be done (and some believe that our capitalist society is just as bad, but we'll put that aside for now.).  Ecological conservation, though not having been fully acheived, is now a common topic of discussion and American thought.  (I just realized I hate the word American.  I also realized that I may be ruining my point with all these parenthetical sidenotes)  And SpongeBob?  Well, SpongeBob is SpongeBob, and he lives in a pineapple under the sea.  So why can't it be possible to breakfree of the mindset that an independent vote is flushed down the drain?   Also, you guys talk about the belief of minimalist government like the republicans or democrats are the first to present this idea.  I think you need to consult the ideas of the French philosophe Jean-Jacques Rouseau and the English theorist John Locke.  Both believed that, when it comes to government, 'less is more.'    Rouseau also proposed the idea that 'personal property is the root of all social evils.'  I find this statement highly intriguing and somewhat appealing.  Could it be that if there were no property, 'social evils' would be abolished?  Thinking about such a thing would require quite a stretch of the imagination, ya?  Now this may seem communist, but I think if you can think about it the way I'm thinking about it, it's not.  No personal property, not even belonging to the government (which Rouseau proposes would be unnecessary.).  A possible qualm with this theory, though, is that we, as humans, somehow have an innate need for ownership.  We feel that it is our right to own  something .  But this could easily be chalked up to a cultural theme, something bestowed upon us by our parents and society.  Nature vs. Nurture if you will.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1428880,indUnk,"                  Why I love living in the city   At one time in my life, I lived in the country.  My home town was Millgrove, just north of Hamilton, Ontario.  There were no bars and for a long time, no cable news.  Tonight, after getting home from work, I watched CNN's ongoing (6 hour) coverage of Michael Jackson's arrest and bail.    When I first got home CNN showed a helicopter feed of Jacko's SUV drive from the Santa Barbara.  Anchors interviewed Jermaine Jackson, Latoya Jackson's ex, and the rest of the cast, about their reactions to MJ's arrest, bail, and trip back to Las Vegas.  I watched a black SUV drive slowly along California freeways, and eventually his warm welcome from anonymous fans on the Vegas strip.  Hours and hours of coverage, reaction, pundentry, and interviews.  Oh yeah, and there was a terrorist bombing in Turkey, committed by the same organization who flew two planes into the World Trade Centre, but who cares about that?  I mean...it's in Turkey for Christ sake!  A country who didn't have the common decency to allow American and British forces to use their soil as a base for attacking Iraq.  CNN decided to show   urlLink this major story   as a side note to the drama unfolding in California.  Quality, quality editorial content.  A nation, engulfed in it's own personal War on Terror, chose to completely ignore this major terrorist event in favour of, alternately, a pop singing peterast's arrest and the 40th anniversary of the assassination of one of it's former presidents.  To escape this insanity I did some spreadsheet work, and then headed downstairs to enjoy a pint in the bar just below my apartment.  And here, is why I love living in Toronto.  Instead of the usual televised offering of SportsNet, or CP24, my local establishment was showing.... urlLink The Producers .  For an hour and a half (and three pints of Creemore Springs) I was able to forget about our neighbour to the south, and watch some of the funniest shit I've ever seen.

1409492,Technology,"        I sympathize  with Lachelle about when she is asked 'where are you from?'. She said she has a hard time answering that question. Me too.   I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. We moved to Puerto Rico when I was three, so I don't consider myself 'from' Missouri. We lived in three separate places in Puerto Rico - the one I remember best was Beach Tower, an apartment building on the Isla Verde beach strip (high tourist area). It was quite literally on the beach; I recall during some really nasty tropical storms an occasional ambitious wave would touch the ground floor. As fond as I am of the Caribbean and as much as I miss it, I am not 'from' Puerto Rico.   We moved to Metro Atlanta when I was thirteen. We lived in Stone Mountain while I was in High School; when I went to College in Statesboro, Georgia, my mother moved to Norcross. When I got out of college (after an abortive attempt to attend graduate school at LSU), I moved in with my mother and didn't leave until the mid-90's when she re-married. I bopped around a few different apartment buildings until I met my husband and we moved in together in Decatur, Alabama. Now we live in Hartselle.  So the best guess would be 'the South'. But I'm not a southerner. *Sigh*. It is a tricky question. I usually answer 'I lived most of my life in Atlanta'. If they want more detail, I add the bit about Missouri and Puerto Rico.   Like most  people, I start my day with the internet. Unlike an old-fashioned newspaper, the internet allows you to pick and choose what you look at.

I do read some news - mainly whatever Yahoo has on its main page.  I also visit some message boards - predominantly movie-oriented. I like the people on  urlLink Jabootu's Mad Movie Dimension . I also read  urlLink Chud's   messageboards, but there's a lot of noise on them. Still, it's a great site (Atlanta based!) for movie news.  Lastly, I read email. I have a Yahoo account where all my mail list mail goes to. I can usually blah blah through most of the posts but the occasional gold nugget shows up (Damian Lewis is going to be the lead in a love story! Yay!! It's a BBC TV production! Boo!!).  Then I visit  urlLink this site  and stare wistfully at the videocam picture of the Charlotte Amalie Harbor.

Bringing the draft back is a heinous idea to me as well, and it drives me crazy because Bush is not being the president that (lost the popular vote but) we elected.  Does anyone remember the debates of 2000 when W. Bush adamantly and outwardly expressed his distaste for the way Clinton was using the military?  Saying directly that U.S. troops should not be used for nation building in other countries.  Hmm... why does W. Bush want to reinstate the draft again?  Ohh, that's right, it's because he needs more troops to continue his nation building in Iraq.  Afghanastan was a justified war.  I entirely understand why the Taliban had to be removed, and (with international backing) it was the right decision to invade.  What W. Bush told the country the reason for invading Iraq was is SOMEWHAT legitimate because Saddam possessing biological/chemical weapons is a threat to our ally Israel, but that's not the reason he decided to invade.  He can blame intelligence all he wants, but suggesting Iraq had tried to acquire Uranium based on zero evidence isn't the kind of credibility I want in a Commander In Chief.  Now, as the motives continue to change, hundreds of Americans are dead because of a W. Bush lie, and he wants thousands more to risk their lives for a quest he said was not worth fighting before he was elected.  I scoff at those who want to support W. Bush because they believe KERRY flip-flops positions.  The more I think about it the sicker I get.  I might type more, but I'm off to do my taxes, attempting to get back some of the money W. Bush is itching to turn into a deficit.  Love, Rob  P.S.  I need a prom date, so if anyone has any ideas, please feel free to let me know.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's this small matter of getting measurements.  You can't do it yourself.  They yelled at me for that and wanted to order me a size 16.  I wear a size 6 pants.  Yeah.  All the bridal shops in my neighborhood, sans una, close before I get off work.  And the one that's left, well, it's very popular and I just didn't want to mess with that madhouse for the 'small' matter of getting my measurements taken, especially when I wasn't ordering the dress through them (over the phone to a company in Illinois, actually).  Well, today I resorted to begging and pleading, and found out that if you act helpless enough and smile pretty enough, a very short woman (she was not much taller than my naval) who is super-nice will come down from Alterations and take your measurements.  She has saved me.  I am about 3 weeks late in ordering this dress.  Thankfully, at least all the dresses are different colors, so they weren't waiting for my order to send all the others in (matching dye-lots and all).  Thanks once again, Field's!

1391421,indUnk,"                  Rearranging the furniture    is an excellent way to get exercise. It's also a good way to procrastinate doing your tax return.   Spent the entire day yesterday shoving furniture around and have now discovered a few muscles that I thought had gone away forever.   Looking back, I have always liked rearranging furniture now and then. I remember in Chicago, we had a 'Schrank' - a big wall closet with showcase compartments that are standard in most german living rooms - these things usually measure big enough to cover up an entire wall. Anyhow, in Chicago this huge thing took up an entire living room wall and worse yet, completely covered one of the windows. One day, I decided enough of that and with help of my friend Lynda, we dismantled that sucker in its three parts. We left one part standing in the living room, lugged the other downstairs into the den, and I think the third one we got upstairs in the guest bedroom. Lol. When my husband got home from work he just gasped.   So, yesterday I rearranged here in the living room. It is also a wonderful way to clean things and areas you usually don't get to. A little tip from me - if you need to move a heavy piece of furniture, get four old socks to put under the corners. It eases pushing the piece across the floor while also avoiding or minimizing scratches. If you are having to push over carpeting, well, that's another story.   On another note, here a couple of things that are now in bloom in my garden:      Bloodwort I planted a few years ago.      My phlox in full bloom.

I gave him some shit but it was pretty much fine. Even though he doesn't think so...he is totally shady. Not the same shady as BC but still shady. And I really do think that we are going to be friends. He just needs to get over the I only hang out with my work friends situation. Like seriously they are all attached at the ass. Like, for me, personally, I would not like the people I work with (the exception of a few people who are pretty much on the same level as you) to know everything that's going on in my personal life. But he knows that. And I guess most of it is attributed to the fact that he moved here and didn't know anyone. But anyways, we might go out next week.

We all stood on the log, and took turns jumping off and staying down..At the tip of the tree, I couldn't even touch (until James moved down) then when everyone jumped off, suddenly the water was around my ankles. It was frighteneing. Adam or James or Shea took off Alanna's top and played catch for a bit. I double knotted my suit, and I think Amy did too...  Then we left! James and Adam and Amy went home, did their own little thing. Cody dropped me and Alanna off. We got dressed, brushed hair, applied make up, comented that Cody was a DREAM he was so hot...:) I enjoyed that. Cody was hot. He had a niiiice ass truck. He likes Techno. In fact, we listened to Da Rude the entire time we were in that truck. W00tage.   Cody and Aaron came back to pick us up, then we went to go get Sheila and Shea, then headed off down to A&W. Ate some food. Good food. Yummy. Went down to peacocks, (oh, and I had shotgunned like, the entire time by now, much to Alanna's displeasure) saw that nobody we wanted was there, and left. Played the 'N' snatching game..:)  In case you've never played, that game is where you see a car with an N on its back, and the car is parked, you take the N. It's soo fun, and I think Cody has like, 30 or something, of N's. That they have snatched. It was perfect. That is also why, when you get out of your car, you take off your N.  We drove down to the waterfront and walked around. I scored holding Cody's hand, even though Alanna did too. But it was most fun. My parents called. Fed them some lies so they wouldnt come panicking past me. Got back to holding Cody's hand again.

1325355,indUnk,"            Metro Rail Rain, vacuum patterns, and my in-laws I could hardly belive that it was raining as hard as it was when i left work today. Luckily i left a little earlier than usual so i could make it over to the metro office in the medical center and purchase a cash value card. By the way, buy this card once and it seemingly allows you unlimited rides on the rail without ever having to justify its monetary value. I had always wondered about this, especially after i saw several people flash them to the metro cops checking tickets recently.  'So, i can use this to ride the rail?'  'yes.'  'do i have to insert it in the machine for a ticket?'  'no'  'so all i have to do is flash it to the metro cop if they happen to check it?'  'yep'  so conceivably you could carry around an empty cash value card and ride the lite rail all day with nothing to worry about, unless of course, they start carrying around little card swipers.  I made it to the train just before it and a torrent of rain swept over the entire medical center. It was crazy. It was like driving through a laser wash. A stiff wind came along with it and blowing sheets of rain along the left side (*ding!* - a la izquierda) of the train. Oh, and if you've even wondered about those little green circle lights on the door as you exit, they REALLY DO OPEN THE DOORS.    'If you need to get off, please press the green button to open the doors. I'm not going to open all the doors so all of you get wet.'   The 'exiters' (4 people total) didn't really get the point. They all got up and each one pressed the button on one of the four doors. All four doors opened and in came the rain, like a swarm of bees.  The next group all dutifully assembled around one door and left. The door quickly shut behind them. The rain was coming down too hard to get out at my stop, so i figured i would take the train to the end of the line and hit it on the way back, giving the rain some time to pass over downtown.  I always imagined that at the end of the line, the train made a large circle and came back around. I was disappointed - very disappointed - that the driver merely stopped and moved from what was now the back of the train to the front. What a let down.  but my gamble paid off; the rain was just a sprinkle when i got off at main street square.  I got home to a home full of dead fleas! yes! Of course, i know that this really isn't the case, and that  urlLink there is still plenty to do in my fight against this enemy.   I vacuumed the entire carpeted portion of my house - every corner and crack and crevice to pick up as many of the dead little carcasses, pupae and larva as i could. This will go on until i can get the back yard treated, which won't be until the rain ends: sometime next week.  My favorite thing about vacuuming is the vacuum pattern. I wish i had taken a photo. Tomorrow look for this.  The in-laws are leaving for chicago tomorrow, so they were dropped off by mike and maru so carol can take them to the airport tomorrow afternoon. I was just finishing up the vacuuming as they arrived. Dropping off turned into a full evening visit with dinner, margaritas, and a ritual blessing of our home by carol's parents. (FLASHBACK: they also married us kneeling at their bedside when we told them we were living together.)  Once the blessing was done, which involved a series of prayers in spanish recited in each and every room of the house (including the garage, but excluding the shed outside); carol's father blessing the house with the baby's left over holy water from his baptism with a lettuce leaf; and the burning of our wedding candle; i was able to finish up something i had been meaning to do since this weekend. I put up curtains in our bedroom.  With this, the night concluded (for me, at least) and i retired to my office, lay on the floor absent of fleas and wrote out a monster post.

Haven't been around anyone yet to share photos (My younger sister's laptop is with her at my older sister's house), so i can't comment on that, yet.  I'm not really impressed with the 'upgrade'. In edit mode, you still get the a substantial pause when you go from photo to photo. Scrolling is still a little jerky, but admittedly, faster. So is renaming rolls. Adding keywords to photos is a first for me, i don't recall if this was available in the previous version. I never used it till tonight. Obvious negative: you can't assign a keyword with a right click on a photo. You have to have your 'keyword pallette' open and you can't just double click a keyword to apply it; you have to highlight the keyword and then click another button to assign the keyword.

I mean, you could play around with looping and stuff, but if you wanted to make a real song (and belive me, you could very very easily) it would be too tedious without a keyboard.

1325355,indUnk,"            What a strange world we live in. I've been following the Haiti/Aristide thing through the lense of Pacifica Radio (KPFT) and last night caught some mainstream TV. In some ways, the situation in Haiti leads me to believe that NPR/BBC is remarkably limited in their world-view, neither's coverage seems very strong to me. The Charlie Rose show last night was excellent, mostly because Rose had someone who was actually from Haiti, partly because he had a broad range of viewpoints:  a Republican congressperson (representing the administration),  a former state department official (representing US government history),  a professor from Columbia University (representing US opposition), and  a radio journalist from Haiti (representing a knowledgable and intelligible Haitian).    One of the conversational gyres was the Columbia prof saying that the current administration was undermining Aristide by withdrawing aid as soon as it came in office. The congressman affirmed this and stated that the US stopped monetary aid because Aristide was embezzling it; however, other forms of aid to Haitians, like food aid, have never stopped. Rose asks the Haitian journalist if this was the case, and she basically confirms it.  The prof then went on about how the stopping of monetary aid was more than just that because it caused a financial payment crisis as the government couldn't pay debt without the cash aid. I missed the response to this, but the point seemed pedantic. Ultimately, if the point about Aristide's aid abuse was correct, then shutting it off would suck, but would be a more preferable method of affecting positive change than sending in the Marines guns-a-blazing.  The Pacifica coverage of the evening took a pretty hard-line stance that the US is supporting the opposition and basically abducted Aristide. One of the more interesting points of coverage is that Aristide's bodyguard was an American company, paid for by the US State Department. I'm thinking, what the hell? If the US is anti-Haiti and anti-Aristinde, why would they spend money on his bodyguards and why would he accept that kind of aid? It doesn't seem to make any sense.  In some ways I wonder if this is a sideshow for other things happening. Maybe it is a sideshow because it has been a pretty slow-news month. Maybe it is a less confusing alternative to attention paid to Venezuela, which is pretty confusing ( urlLink Caracas Chronicles ). Who are the bad guys? What is democracy? What is the purpose of government other than an alternative to anarchy?

1316364,Student,"           I first heard about this story a few days back. All I could think about is that 'They are going to behead this innocent man, for being nothing more than American' This article is taken from  urlLink MSNBC ... I pray for his family today.   American hostage reportedly beheaded  Demands had given Saudis 72 hours to save Paul Johnson's life MSNBC News Services Updated: 1:55 p.m. ET June 18, 2004 urlLink http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5196406/'> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5196406/    RIYADH, Saudi Arabia - A statement published on an Islamic Web site Friday claimed that American hostage Paul Johnson had been beheaded. The Web site also published photos apparently showing Johnson after death. The claim could not be independently confirmed.  'As we promised ... we have beheaded the American hostage Paul Marshall (Johnson) after the deadline ... passed,' the statement said. It was signed by the Organization of al-Quid in the Arabian Peninsula.  The Saudi correspondent for the Arab satellite network Al-Arabia earlier told CNN he had seen a video of the beheading.  Thousands of Saudi security forces had intensified their search of fundamentalist strongholds Friday as the deadline approached for Johnson to be executed by his Islamic militant kidnappers.  The kidnappers did not set a specific time when the deadline runs out. A videotape with the threat appeared on a Web site at about midnight Tuesday Saudi time, and if counted from that point the 72 hours would run out by midnight Friday, or 5 p.m. ET Friday.  In the video, the kidnappers vow to kill Johnson unless the Saudi government released all the militants in its prisons. The Saudis have rejected the demand.  Police vehicles drove through the Swede, Dhahran al-Boudoir and Bard districts overnight and into Friday, but the authorities gave no indication they were any closer to finding Johnson, an employee of the U.S. defense corporation Lockheed Martin who was kidnapped last weekend.  Reuters A June 12 posting on the Sawt al Jihad Islamist Web site, shows the photo of Paul Johnson, whom militants said they had kidnapped that day. People living in the three districts, which lie in western and southern Riyadh, suggest that the kidnappers enjoy popular support, partly because of U.S. policy in Iraq and its perceived backing for Israel.  'How can we inform on our brothers when we see all these pictures coming from Abu  and Rajah,' Mukluks NOF, a resident of Dhahran al-Boudoir, said at a restaurant called Jihad, or holy war in Arabic. He was referring to the pictures of Iraqis abused by U.S. soldiers at the Abu  prison in Baghdad and the Israeli military's killing of Palestinians and the destruction of their homes in the Gaza refugee camp of Rajah.  'This is not a little skirmish. It is a war,' NOF added.  But a top Saudi cleric, the preacher of Imam Sultana Mosque in Riyadh, implored the kidnappers to release Johnson in a column published in Al-Riyadh newspaper on Friday.  'O, youth of the nation who have trodden the wrong path, come back to the fold of the community of Islam. Avoid this sedition and be obedient to the ruler of the Muslims,' Sheik Mohammed bin Sad al-Saeed wrote, referring to King Fahd.  And Johnson's Thai wife, Thanom, appealed for her husband's release on the Saudi-owned satellite TV channel Al-Arabiya. 'When I see him in TV, I remember the medicine he needs,' she said, her voice wavering. 'I am afraid. I will do my best for him. Please bring him back to me.'  Few leads A senior Saudi official in the United States said officials have had few promising leads in their search for Johnson, whose kidnappers claim to be the al-Qaida chapter in Saudi Arabia.  The Saudi official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said there had been no communications from the kidnappers except for the video and statement on the Web site.  The FBI has sent a team of about 20 specialists in hostage rescue, hostage negotiations, profiling and other specialties who were working directly with Saudi officials, the official said. Reuters American hostage Paul Johnson as shown in a video released by his apparent captors.  More than 15,000 Saudi officers have been deployed in the search of Riyadh, going door-to-door in some neighborhoods. More than 1,200 Saudi homes had been searched as of Thursday night.  'We are even using the fire department, for instance, because they have knowledge of their neighborhoods, and districts,' the official said. The Saudi official said the suspected leader of al-Qaida in the kingdom, Abdulaziz Issa Abdul-Mohsin al-Moqrin, whom the video tape identified as the hooded man making a speech, is also the main suspect in the shootings of a German citizen and an American in the kingdom recently.  Johnson, 49, had worked in Saudi Arabia for more than a decade.   Vigils back home  Friends and relatives of Johnson sang 'Amazing Grace' and 'God Bless America' as they held candles and small flags at a vigil late Thursday in Eagleswood, N.J., a town where the engineer had lived.  'Your love, your prayers and your support are appreciated,' his niece Angle Roork said at the vigil.  More than 200 people attended the service in Port St. John, Fla., where Johnson’s son, Paul Johnson III, lives.  “We feel helpless here. I bet most people here have an awful feeling that this might be futile,” said Father Tony Quinlivan of Blessed Sacrament in Cocoa, Fla. “But it’s never futile when a community comes together.”  Amid concern over Johnson's fate, the U.S. State Department updated a 2-month-old travel warning for Saudi Arabia, pointing out that attacks on Americans there have resulted in deaths and injuries and, in a reference to Johnson, a kidnapping. The Associated Press and Reuters contributed to this report.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1316364,Student,"             todays venting  I find now, that in times of need the FRG and my family are there for me. There was never any doubt about that. The thing that bothers me though is that some of my friends aren’t there for me and what is even worse is the fact that it took getting me drunk for them to realize that I wasn’t as ok as I make everyone believe. I do have to say that the Lexapro that my doctor put me on has helped me deal with the depression and anxiety that comes along with this whole situation, and although I am usually against using medication to solve my problems, sometimes it’s the best route to a resolution. No one outside of my immediate family knows that I am on anti-depressants and if it ever came up in a conversation I would proudly say I am taking them. I am not ashamed that this is what I have resulted in doing to take care of myself during these hard times because some times talking it out doesn’t help. It’s just a quick fix and not more than 2 hours later you are wondering why you told this person everything you did. I know when I attended therapy sessions I opened myself up to my doctor and then afterwards would mentally beat myself up once I realized what I said to her about my family and friends. I guess looking back on it I felt that those things needed to come out because they were things that were eating at me but I couldn’t ever understand why I would confide my thoughts and feelings in a complete stranger, a doctor that all I knew about her was her name.  I guess with things happening the way they have these last few days, I feel like the medication isn’t working and that I would give anything to confide my deepest darkest secrets to that mystery doctor, for just a half an hour just to be able to talk to someone who wouldn’t judge me by my words, just to have a sense that someone was actually listening to me and my concerns.  I know if any of my friends happen to read this entry that will probably feel that I am using this as an opportunity to personally attack them, but that is not my point. I am just trying to use this as a way to compensate for the lack of communication/dialogue between live persons. I love my friends more then they probably realize but they have their own lives they have to take care of and I don’t expect them to be there for me 100%, I would never expect that, I just want to have an ear to listen to me when I need it, just like I have done for them in the past, several times.   Right now they can’t be here for me because they have their own things and I understand that, I guess I just wish that they didn’t.   I am wondering if I am being selfish about this whole thing.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ha! and fail it did these past few weeks. In some weird way, this makes me happy.  Donuts and work. How synonymous are these two things? I'd say pretty damn synonymous if you ask me. Jesus, is synonymous even spelled correctly? Everyone loves eating donuts at the office. Every friday, it never fails. One of the three higher-ups would bring in one to two boxes of donuts (depending on how frugal they are) and the hard workers consume them with a lust unseen by the animal world. It's always a race to get the donut that you love to eat before it's snatched by that unsuspecting co-worker...WHO KNOWS that NOBODY loves that particular donut as much as you do!   Not that I eat donuts all the time. I don't. But when you get a hankering for one and find out that your favorite was just stolen from its nest only seconds after you finished up that phone call, you gotta be mad at somebody!  *sigh* Donuts.

1290874,Non-Profit,"           Ikaw ba'y nalolongkot, Gostong makalemut sa sarili?   Puwes, manood ka ng  Imelda .&nbsp;Sa halagang 65 pesos,&nbsp;garantisado ang&nbsp;laugh trip.   O siguro fan lang talaga ako ng angkan ng mga Marcos kaya bentang-benta&nbsp;sa akin&nbsp;at di ako napikon sa mga pinakita sa pelikula. Pinanood ko nga pala ito nung Lunes kasama ang nanay ko. Sayang nga lang at di namin naisama ang lola ko na numero unong fan ni Imelda. Kaya nga siguro ako aliw na aliw sa mga&nbsp;Marcos ay dahil sa lolo't lola ko na mga loyalista. Sangkatutak ang mga litrato, libro, mga memorabilia na nagkalat sa paligid ko noong ako'y lumalaki pa lamang.   Nakakamangha&nbsp;talaga yung kagandahan ni Imelda kahit na matanda na siya. Pansin na pansin ang pagiging banidosa niya at maselan niya hanggang ngayon. Ang gagarbo pa rin ng suot na damit at naka-french tip pa ang lola mo with matching red na nail polish na base. Astig! kung lahat ba naman ng matatanda sa mundo ay marunong mag-alaga sa sarili ng tulad ni Imelda eh di sana...sabagay, hindi naman lahat ng tao ay sing kurakot at sing yaman niya.  Maraming nakakaaliw na aspeto ang pelikula sa kabila ng pagiging dokumentaryo nito. Nariyan ang pakantahin si Imelda,&nbsp;ang pamimigay ng litrato niya sa mga street children, ang pagre-touch ng make-up at paghingi ng Kleenex habang iniinterview, ang pagdrowing ng kung ano anong kabalbalan para i-explain ang kaniyang mga 'pilosopiya' sa buhay at marami pang iba. Sa kalagitnaan ng pelikula&nbsp;napaisip tuloy ako&nbsp;kung may sayad ba itong babaeng ito o wala dahil ang lakas ng amats niya. Napaka-out of this world ng mga ideya at pinagsasabi niya, sa totoo lang.  Meron isang insidente kung saan pinagtangkaan siyang patayin habang nagbibigay ng speech. Nakuha yun sa video at nakakasindak dahil hawak nung assasin niya ay isang bolo. At ano ang reaksyon ni Imelda sa lahat ng naganap? Bukod sa&nbsp;naisip niyang magpa-plastic surgery dahil sa 11 na hiwang natamo, naisip din niya na hindi siya karapat-dapat mamatay sa pamamagitan ng isang napakapanget na jungle bolo. Sana man lang daw, ay tinalian ng yellow ribbon para man lang maging maayos. Panalo talaga!  Isa pang eksena sa pelikulang tumatak sa utak ko ay nung pinapanood niya sa kaniyang projection TV&nbsp;ang kaniyang mga anak na si Bongbong at Imee bilang panauhin sa isang talk show.&nbsp;Halatang&nbsp;proud na proud si Imelda sa mga naabot ng kaniyang mga anak sa larangan ng pulitika. At&nbsp;bukod pa rito, nung babanggitin na nila Imee at Bongbong kung gaano 'kagaling' na pulitiko ang kanilang ina, pinalakasan niya pa ang volume para maemphasize ang mga sinasabi nila.  Hindi talaga sapat ang kuwento para mabigyan ng hustisya ang entertainment value ng pelikulang ito. Mas lalo nitong pinakulay ang makulay ng buhay at pagkatao ni Imelda sa saking isipan. Sa isang banda'y hahangaan mo ang katalinuhan, karangyaan at kagandahan niya ngunit sa&nbsp;kabilang banda naman ay maaring siya'y iyong kaawaan o kamuhian dahil wala siyang pag-amin o pinapakitang&nbsp;pagsisi sa mga nagawa nilang kasalanan noon.    'If you know how rich you are, you are not rich. But me, I am not aware of the extent of my wealth. That's how rich we are.'  - Imelda Marcos quoted from Phil. Daily Inquirer, 1998  ---------------------  Kahapon, July 27, 2004 ay pumanaw na si Sebia, ang naging kasambahay ng lolo't lola ko sa loob ng maraming taon. Malaki ang utang na loob&nbsp;ng pamilya namin&nbsp;sa kanya dahil naging mabuti siyang tagapag-alaga hindi lang ng mga tito at tita ko kundi pati ng mga anak nila. Naging tapat siyang&nbsp;kasama hanggang sa huli at wala siyang ibang tinuring na pamilya kundi ang sa amin. ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I just finished a book series I loved, and in my deep funk because I have no more of those favorites to read, having gobbled them up greedily, and bereftly looking for another author like her (Jaqueline Carey), I found you had positively reviewed Storm Constantine (who amazon listed as 'similar to Carey').  Since I love your work, and respect your opinion, I bought several of Constantine's books (they haven't arrived yet but I have great hopes).  So on to the lazy question:  Do you have a list of authors you would 'not trade for'[I think it was 20] Anne Rices'? (that's a poorly remembered paraphrase of your review of her).  People you have on that bookshelf you frequently re-read, that isn't necessarily the shelf you parade for impressing guests?  Maybe ten or so, and then I can go from there?  Dark, twisted, but ultimately heartwarming & funny stuff?  Stuff by which Queen Victoria would *not* be amused?  Goth-y stuff that makes you think?  Stuff like yours, and Constantine's, and heck, maybe even Pratchett's?

1268682,indUnk,"        everybody's angular   My apologies to Sarah Rodman. Not only are her music articles one of the  urlLink Boston Herald's  few redeeming qualities, but I completely dissed her by saying (in my last post) that nobody bothered to review either of the two weekend  urlLink Joe Jackson  concerts at the Paradise. It turns out that Sarah wrote a review for the Friday show which appeared in the Sunday paper. It doesn't really seem worthwhile to give you a link to the review since you have to pay for Herald archives, dammit. But the review itself is very good and Sarah righted her previous wrong by giving Joe's correct age (48). We must have some sort of cosmic telepathic link, because she and I, without realizing it, both used the word 'angular' when describing Joe's song 'Fools in Love' (she called it 'angular white boy funk,' while I referred to it as 'angular reggae').   urlLink April  posted something rather humorous the other day regarding life as a peon in the retail world.

1255416,Student,"       I just had a very basic revelation.  Art is not in the performance, it is in the capacity to move.  Ashley and I were once having an argument.  I said that a computer would be just as capable of creating a beuatiful piece of music as anything produced by a trained musician.  I was wrong.  I thought that what poeple thought of as artistic expression was actually just an imaginary imperfection placed in the music or whatever.  This isn't true.  great art can cause someone to feel something.  Bad art doesn't.  The most obvious example is acting.  A technically bad actor will most always be terrible.  A technically bad actor will also be very easy to spot.  However, just because someone is technically good, doesn't mean they're a good actor.  A good actor is someone who can make the audience feel something, be it happiness, sadness, pity, whatever.  If the audience is bored or if the audience jsut plain doesn't like a certain part of a play, then it's bad acting.  Plain and simple.  No amount of technical superiority can fix this.  I probably should have realized this loooong ago, but no matter, any thoughts anyone who actually reads this thing?  Who does read this thing anyway?         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1255416,Student,"       Jesus....long day.  I've just gotten done with my homework.  I wrote a terrible essay describing my grandmother's apartment, trying to show through her possessions that she has a dynamic personality, that she's an interesting person..but the three page limit kinda kept me from going into enough detail to get that across.  I guess I understand the compulsion to write a novel, it's hard to get enough detail on a few pages to get a decent idea across without out and out saying it.  Anyway, Nadia said hi to me today after not talking to me for a little while.  I guess Stephanie convinced to ignore cause she didn't like me for whatever reason.  It's a good thing cause I didn't really like her all that much, though Nadia's cool.  Have you ever felt really really tired, but only mentally?  Like, a feeling of being drained, as if the frontal lobe of your brain could get fatigued.  I got that today...I could barely think for 3 or 4 hours, it's a terrible feeling.  Never actually had that before, it makes me feel really really stupid, like when I was high, absolutely drained and slow.  I guess that's what it feels like to be stupid and try and concentrate on a difficult concept, it just can't be done.  I hope I keep this thing updated..and I actually read through it later, I read through old e-mail now and it makes no sense, so many allusions that I can't remember.  This seems more stable and permanent, you know?  Maybe I won't be able to lose my junior year in the same way I've lost the rest of my life.

1241488,Publishing,"                 We played Portia Sorority night at the UP Fair; they had commissioned all the Backbeat Bands to play that night and we got included as a bonus. Before this date, we had been worried because we couldn't contact Ralph and weren't sure whether he'd be able to make it.  Thankfully, he arrived at around 8 pm along with Charmaine, whom we hadn't seen in a long time.  The show was an hour late, but by the time they started, things were running smoothly.  There were some stressful moments on the part of Backbeat management due to bands who hadn't arrived at their respective call times wanting to still perform.  Surprisingly, I wasn't nervous that night, probably because I had already been backstage the 2 previous nights and also because I learned from last year's situation. Ayn and I were really anxious last year, always conscious that classmates or acquaintances would see us.  After the performance, which went fairly well, we felt like, 'That was IT?' hahaha! Anyway, I felt relaxed before, during and after the performance, which was a first! The only thing that probably gave me nerves was the fact that I was dying to pee right before our set ;) what a horrible feeling.  Onstage, we couldn't really tell we sounded ordinary, which isn't really a good thing so we were thinking, 'Ok, not a stupendous set, but we're getting through this fine.'  It was fun, though, and I actually spoke a little, even if it was only to say happy birthday to my friends and to say which bands were coming next.  Then we made way for the next band.  Some people complimented us on our performance and we thanked them.  Allan was still stressed about work so he may have seemed curt to these people at first. We appreciated their comments and were surprised that our set turned out well, after all.  We listened to it afterwards on John Paul's camcorder.  We had to wait until Parokya ni Edgar finished before we could leave.  Then we went to Pares :D Damn, I can't remember all the funny stuff that happened anymore got sick yesterday and wasn't able to jot this all down immediately.  It was just great to be with everyone again: Ayn was with us at Pares, Ralph is still alive, Roel was there (even if binitin niya kami sa 'My Silver Chair' hehehe) even Charmaine showed up.  It was a good reunion.  Buzz Night is this Saturday! I think Carnival Park is supposed to play, too I forgot to put them in last entry's list.

1234631,indUnk,"                 So the guy I like... He is such a nice guy. He is so smart. He is funny. He has a very good taste in music. And he looks very nice in dress-up clothes. What more could a girl want?  Ok, so he is not like the typical guy that girls fall over themselves for, at least, I don't think he is.  But he is very nice and he has a very cute smile.  I only get to tall to him sporadically but I really enjoy it when I do get to talk to him.  The problem is that I just don't know how to act around guys I like.  It is pretty crazy.  I wish that I could just completely forget all of my insecurities about myself and just not be afraid to go all out and make an effort to see him more and talk to him a lot.  But I mean, I didn't even talk to him at the NHS induction and he was standing like right there.  Oh the confusion.  Heh, but it is worth it.  I am serious.  I haven't liked a guy in so long.  I love it.  I had a dream last night that I was buried up to my neck in sand and he came up to me and started talking to me in a foreign language.  And then I was at TAMS but it was like a really rich school and really pretty and then he was there for some reason.  It was a weird dream.  I don't know if I will ever have an excuse to talk to him ever again...how incredibly depressing!!!  I will find a way.  I must find a way.  hehe, I crack myself up.  This is so fun.  It's like an adventure.  I wish I could have a relationship.  I have music planned out for each stage of the relationship.  Even the break up music.

Because even though you like them, you hate them, and even though you hate everything about them, you like him.  What then?  And why do you still talk to him after you have moved away and yall talk more now than you ever did when you lived here and then he says all these things and you are just like well what a nice fellow and then you start thinking but he's a bastard I should hate him.  But why is he a bastard?  Well, he's a bastard because he makes me have butterflies in my stomach when I talk to him.  Well, why do I have butterflies in my stomach when I talk to him?

So, I'll lay down and not be able to sleep as my mind goes in circles from one thing to the next and I get mentally dizzy and I ponder the what-ifs...the past, present, and future what-ifs.

We started creating 'pyro art' or something in the air with WD40 by catching the flame with it and moving the stream all over the place then passing the flame back and forth from person to person. Hey, did you know that melting plastic bags make a really cool 'ziiiiiiiing' sound when they drip? O, or did you know that glowsticks explode when you toss them in a fire? (LOL)  Come Saturday, Cam and I went over to the Gadeholt's house from when 'Uncle' Greg, 'Auntie' Irene, Timy and we went to Multnomah Falls (3rd highest in N. America) and climbed 8 miles from the base up to Larch Mountain. The entire assent was something like a 4,900 foot increase in elevation. The average grade of the trail we followed was 13.75%. After the fourth hour or so, Cam, Timy and I discovered that it was actually easier to run up certain parts of the trail than to walk up. :) The scenery was spectacular though - myriads of little waterfalls running down the stream on either side of the trail. At one point, we spent a good 20 minutes hurtling boulders into part of the stream... When I stopped for a moment and asked the cliff face (the direction that I was looking) why we were doing it, Uncle Greg responded 'Because it's there'.

I was going to go stir crazy. 0322 hrs in Kingston some nutty woman on the phone wanting all sort's of weird shit. Just another random day at Kingston. My shadow has been nothing but a pain stalking me today. grrrrrrrrrr  I dunno If I have wound Colin up that he really never want's ever to see me again , but he waited to say bye and hoped I stay away in NZ forever. Carol , the mad asronist , like myself I add ,( Coney - thei lady could well have been a serious contender for burning all the vango's at school that year ) , was hyper , spent the evening  typing out a letter head for prospective employer's for her in Nz .  She is off shortly after I get back and want's to work G's ( Horses to the rest of us non horsey types ) , no work was done by me last night really except Carol's letter.

122217,indUnk,"       To tell the truth, I'm kind of looking forward to having  urlLink al Jazeera on my TV . Not that I think it's going to happen anytime soon, thanks to the CRTC's ruling this week requiring cable or satellite providers to prevent potentially abusive content from being broadcast.   Just how a cable company is going to constantly monitor a live 24 hour news network, in Arabic, and turn off objectionable content on the fly... wasn't adequately explained. Which means I won't be seeing the subversive al Jazeera on Star Choice anytime soon.   Enough of that.

122217,indUnk,"       No, I'm not talking about President Bush's surprise trip to Baghdad yesterday. I'm talking about the existence of  urlLink the International Council of Shopping Centers . The rather sparsely designed website features a publication of the month ( urlLink 'Winning Shopping Center Designs' -- order several now for the gift-giving season) and it also reminds us of the vital role shopping centers play in our national security. The site notes the elevated threat of terrorist attacks and features a special button that says 'Shopping Centers on ALERT.' Unfortunately, this portion of the site is off-limits to those without a password-- the security details about such foundations of our democracy as 'The Coffee Beanery' are for members only. So lets salute our shopping centers... promoting consumption of unnecessary goo-gas while protecting the institutions we hold dear-- Congress, The Presidency, The Limited, Linens and Things.  Related, albeit tangentially, to the goofiness above, is a  urlLink nice piece  by the Globe and Mail's correspondent covering the Lee Malvo trial-- the link via  urlLink Soblo , who is refreshingly handsome and Canadian-- not to imply that these are mutually exclusive traits.  from  urlLink Waremouse : apparently we're looking for the same guy.

So says  urlLink today's Washington Post ... quoting a number of city leaders in DC and elsewhere. They note the subtle, subliminal effect of those dark splotches of old gum left on sidewalks... accumulating with each passing year.  'They contend that cleanliness equals safety in the minds of visitors, and that old gum -- along with graffiti and window bars -- subtly dissuades shoppers, tourists and even potential residents and commercial investors. The gum, in other words, hinders the improvement of neighborhoods, slowing the revival even of ones that are seeing major new investment.'  There are already parts of DC where workers use steam-driven 'gum removal' machines and businesses in other areas, like Adams Morgan, are considering it.  There's a good  urlLink op-ed on gays in the military  in today's Times. Nathaniel Frank of UCSB attacks the argument of miliary cohesion that opponents of lifting the gay ban often use. And he argues that the zealous enforcement of 'don't ask don't tell' has put the nation's security at risk. He cites the dismissal of the gay translators last year and the generally lower quality of those hired in their place.  A couple choice excerpts:  The growing understanding that the gay ban is bad for national security may explain why even those who once supported the ban now support letting gays serve. The former judge advocate general for the Navy, Rear Adm. John D. Hutson, who was involved in the development and enforcement of the policy, recently said that the ban is a failed policy whose elimination would strengthen the military. A Fox News poll conducted in August shows that 64 percent of Americans now favor allowing gays to serve openly in the military, up from 56 percent in a similar poll taken in 2001.  The debate over gays in the military was never really about balancing civil rights with national security. Britain, Israel, Canada and Australia are among 24 militaries that lifted bans on gay soldiers without undermining unit cohesion or combat readiness. These experiences show that the choice is not between gay rights and military readiness. It is between prejudice that compromises national security and equality that enhances it. And that's no choice at all.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122217,indUnk,"       It's been a while since I last wrote anything. I was in DC for a few days... seeing friends and taking it easy.   I read most of ' urlLink The Radical Center .' It's a great 'new politics and ideas of the 21st century' kind of book. I've really enjoyed it and the ideas it contains-- particularly the section on Social Security.  I've also been making additional progress in the  urlLink John Adams  bio by David McCullough. Now that it's won the Pulitzer Prize, I feel like I should get serious and finish it. I'm less than half way through it at this point. But it's great reading.  Sometimes, books go down easier than at other times. Know what I mean? There are some days or periods where even seeing a particular book reminds me how much I don't want to pick it up. But then this past week, I opened the John Adams after letting it sit for several months. I spent about 3 hours in it and I would have read much longer had we not run out of time.  I got quite a sunburn sitting outside  urlLink Cosi on Connecticut Ave in Dupont Circle  on Thursday. It was a gorgeous day and I spent about 4 hours working my way through 'The Radical Center.' I got the most ridiculous farmer's tan ever. It's fading pretty quickly now. But it's also peeling of course-- on my forehead and stuff. So that's the price I pay.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
122217,indUnk,"       Sitting at an outdoor cafe yesterday for my 4 hour lunch/meeting, I was struck with this realization: there were literally hundreds of people around us, sipping beverages, chatting, reading, people-watching.  Do these people work? And if they do, how can I get a job like theirs?  Actually, I have a pretty relaxed job. A good thing because I've always had a pretty relaxed attitude toward authority, work 'hours', and carefully laid out and politically fractious org charts. My approach has always been along the following lines: if I have an idea and it's good, then let's get the right team together to do it and hang the org chart. The prime criteria is performance. I'm this odd mix of careful diplomat and bull-in-china-closet.  My career history has been with a few organizations that adhere to that kind of ethic. In two cases, when that ethic disappeared and the workplace became more regimented and hierarchical, I left. It took me several years to piece together circumstances and situations... to understand that this was a driving force behind my style as an employee and eventually, as a manager. In the past two years, I've had some great job offers come my way-- big salary increases, cool cities. But I've turned them down because the organizations making the offer have been anything but the kind of place where I could make a difference. All because a couple years ago, a career coach pointed out to me this aspect of my personality and suggested I think hard about job offers in light of that.  I was talking to an entrepreneur friend of mine the other day, explaining this realization and how it now shapes the career decisions I make. He looked at me, paused, and said, 'Ok, you're entering management now. What happens five years from now when some bright up-and-comer shows up with a lot of ideas - some of them not so great, but many of them quite good? Will you reach down to him or her the same way your mentors at all these jobs have reached down to you? Or will you become a part of the problem?'  Good question.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1221843,indUnk,"       things i am learning...  - pride and selfishness are sneaky sins hiding out in the midst of many 'good deeds.' - we often fool ourselves into thinking we're trusting God when we're really either trusting our apparent ability to live the 'Christian life' or trusting our own understanding. - i need to be more honest. - family and friends are way more important than i can even say. - spending or not spending time with God daily, takes its toll, for better or worse, on how i handle my life.  - i am often obsessed with being 'useful' to God, instead of obsessed with loving Him.  feel free to add your own.  they don't have to be all 'spiritual' or whatever.  but really, somehow, everything is i think.

1209865,Architecture,"        Tofu & Rice  Put 1 cup rice on to boil with 2 cups water.  Put a little salt in there, cover it with a lid, when it starts to boil, put the heat on so low, it's almost out.  Don't stir the rice.  Steam for 20 minutes, or until done.   (I like brown rice, but it takes 40 minutes, and we are losers, so screw that.)  While rice is steaming:    Oven to 350.  Pour a little oil into a cookie sheet that's got sides on it---roll the pan around so the oil coats evenly, or use that Pam cooking spray.  Let it heat up in the oven.  Mix up some curry powder with some loose bullion powder (of your choosing--I prefer vegetarian beef) (you can use salt and pepper if you are lame) in a big plastic baggie.  Drain a cube of Firm Tofu.  Wrap it in a clean kitchen towel and gently press the excess water out of the tofu block.  Cut the tofu into strips or cubes.  Put it in the baggie.  Shake, shake, shake your booty.  Arrange the tofu strips / cubes on the hot oil tray so that they're not touching.  The tofu should sizzle when you put it on the tray.  Bake for about 5-10 minutes, until the bottoms start to look browned and crispy.  Turn with a spatula at this point.  Cook another 5 minutes to brown the other side.  Remove and drain on paper towels.    Turn the oven off.    Check the rice.  Throw some frozen broccoli in a bowl.  Salt it, throw a pat of butter on top.  Nuke it for 2-3 minutes.     Voila.  Baked curry tofu, rice and broccoli.  You will be a cooking loser no more.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1171643,indUnk,"       An essay I've written for a social studies class, one that I really enjoyed writing.  A note: this is not my true opinion of mankind.  We had two choices--argue that he is flawed or that he isn't.  I felt that writing about mankind being perfect would be a great deal more fun than imperfect, because it creates such a helpless dream of man, one of a ruthless and invulnerable creature with the infinite power to bend the universe to his will.  Take care.  Is mankind fundamentally flawed?  If god created everything, then surely his greatest and most coveted creation was man.  Mankind is perfect.  Man is the pinnacle of creation, from the beginning; from the first binding proteins to his simian ancestors man has been the one goal of everything.  Creation, life and death were meant to contribute to a future being who would be omnipotent among his fellow creatures.  Man is this being, a fruit of the toils that trillions of predecessors have died over and evolved to create.  Man is the only organism that can, with the power of his intellect, destroy whole worlds, enslave, drive to extinction, or multiply whole species, for whatever purpose he deems necessary to accomplishing his singular goal of omnipotence.  He has spread about every atom of land on his homeworld and has been patiently looking outward to the stars, for more places to conquer, to overcome, to bend to his will through wielding the power of his immense intellectual superiority.  The world is mans slave; therefore, every fellow living creature in the world is a hostage of man.  Man has had the power for many decades now to reduce the world to a radioactive inferno incapable of supporting life for thousands of years.  The five established nuclear powers - the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain - possess enough nuclear warheads to obliterate the world many times over.1 This gives mankind as a whole the ability to wipe the world clean of the stench of life, of non-omnipotence.  There is no being that can stand in mans way, there is no being that can escape a nuclear purge, one that could only be sent forth from the magic of mankind.   For many thousands of years there have been several species that have been domesticated by man, that have been taken from their habitats by man to serve man.  These creatures include the cow, for milk and meat, the pig, for meat, the chicken, for meat, and many othersall of them serving his colossus, all of them totally dependent on man for his nourishment.  Each cow, each pig is bred to live a life of enslavement until a quick end, where their insides and skins will be purified and then devoured without a second thought by the billions of pinnacles of creation.  Nonhumans are helpless.  Compared to the fates of other creatures, however, this measure of permanent enslavement is merciful.  Few species have been eliminated entirely by mankind, a great deal; however, have been driven to the periphery of extinction.  More people require more space to live in and more natural resources, such as land to farm or build on.  Other organisms have to compete with people for space and natural resources.  People usually win.2 Nothing stands in mans way; nothing can defeat man.  Scientists recognize what they call a background extinction rate. This is the rate at which species go extinct naturallywithout any help from humans. But species are currently going extinct at about 1,000 times the background rate, largely because of a growing human population. Humans can threaten plants and animals in a number of ways.3 The stench of life, of non-humanity, of non-omnipotence, is disappearing now, as the race of man forges the way to a time where any species that is not necessary to mans survival will be nonexistent.    The species of man is perfect.  Undeniably perfect.  No other organism has ever achieved what it has, no other organism has superceded what nature intended for it to dothat is, to conquer and overcome the challenges of other threats and other dangers.  It is the perfect species in that it is more successful than any organism before it, that it holds every organism living on earth as its own hostage, with extinction or enslavement choices that mankind alone will delegate.  Mankinds omnipotence cannot be matched; his control cannot be duplicated by other species.  To have absolute control over everything is to be god.  Therefore they are gods, and therefore they are perfect.

1169141,Arts,"             Two of my favorite things in the world are in the subject header. Yesterday I had the greatest time performing in Taylor's little reading series for senior citizens. We met up at this little old folk home on 93rd street. I got there a little bit early and the hunger pain kicked in so I headed to go buy a slice of pizza.   The reading started with taylor doing a great cover by Robert Frost to a crowd of 12-15 of the cutest little old folk.  Before you think about it; I didn't flip and scream out ' Precision guided bombs are dropping!!!! '. I went laid back with ' the Weather ' and hit that nostalgic string. The string was a little off-tune but they appreciated it.   Jessica and Oscar were in attendance and they also read and did well. There is something about reading for a small crowd that is very comfortable. These beautiful senior citizens were attentive and they made me feel soooo good.  Taylor has more issues then what I normally thought. I love the guy to death but he almost killed some of the old ladies!!! He has about 20 foam apples that state ' Speak with conviction' on them. He gives them out ( well, gingerly throws them )to the audience. He starts a poem in hopes they would throw the apples at him and he can throw them back.  Well, one little old lady threw the apple at Taylor and he proceeds to pick the apple back and LAUNCHES it back at the old lady. Dudes- this lady had to be at least 85 and better and he hit her right in the chest. My mind was running in circles. I was thinking ' Taylor, you are going to kill one of these old ladies dude'. It was all in fun and they loved it. As Taylor proceeded to tell us this was his test run; no one at any other VENUE better talk shit!! 90 year old ladies held it down and didn't complain.  We finished and headed to eat and had some great conversation involving poetry and some other topics. It was a blur once I got my steak. It was an 'ok' steak but I had worse. It was all in the good of poetry so I really can't complain.  The evening was kinda hot as Eric, Tom, Mike, Oscar, Kelly, Lourdes and all met up at City Island for a post post post birthday shindig. We had a great time and laughed sooooooo hard. I acted a fool with my hair and sitting between Lourdes and Kelly both brushing my hair made my sexual fantasies kick in.

I burned off a bunch of angry energy by rearranging living room furniture and vacuuming.

I don't understand where love ends and dependence begins, but maybe I shouldn't worry about that. Maybe all of this is to show me that God loves me even more. Maybe this is God's tangible way to show my helplessness and my need for Him. I hope it sinks in. This is a painful lesson.  I hit a little mania this week. Enough that I sound like a tweeker. I look like one when I see my eyes, I look wired. Fortunately, I have had the meds to knock me out so I am not up 36 hours. It's interesting to see that when I am like this, and I drink, I feel kind of level...a little normal. I have had two nights this week that I have drank more than I usually do, and it mellowed me out. It didn't depress me. But definitely, I can't drink when I am pissed or upset. It would make it worse.  I spent New Years in a house in the hills (not the Hollywood Hills) but our south bay version of it, Mt. Helix. It's a place for people with money. I video taped it. Kristy, excuse me, Deputy Kristy Spratt, and I played Cops/Cribs/Room Raiders. It was fun. Her boyfriend was housesitting for some people and they said have people over, and eat and drink what ever you'd like. AwwwYeah. We had steaks, and Karl Straus Beer (that's a San Diego beer) and I of course found and opened the 2nd most expensive bottle of Champaign in the house. Moet. There's supposed to be those little two dots over the 'e'. It's a Champaign that costs anywhere from 30-60 dollars a bottle. There was another bottle (these people had like 30 bottles of wine, Champaign, and sparkling Champaign...not to mention every kind of liquor you could imagine including Mead! Anyway, the other expensive bottle, was around 40-60 a bottle. I had it before and I didn't like it. I prefer the Moet, it is my favorite Champaign. Unfortunately, no one else like Champaign, so I drank most of the bottle myself. And two beers and a highly caffeinated coffee drink with 2 shots of 151 and 3 shots of this pecan liquor. I dubbed it...Skittlebrau. It was tasty. Everyone liked it. I cut myself off after that and was drinking plenty of water. By the way, this all was before 10 pm. I still had two hours to go. But I didn't feel like a normal drunk. I felt impaired, but my mind was sharp. It was like the alcohol helped me direct the speed of my mind and use it at my discretion. It was really kind of odd. Then we all had sparkling wine at midnight, the cheaper stuff that Julie brought was really good. I can't remember the name, but I do remember you had to pop a cork not unscrew a cap so it was decent.  And so, with really two days left to go, and two friends left to see, I am looking forward to getting back home to Lexington.         ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where is Sanchar Kranti:  Revolution (Kranti) is always universal. If things happening at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkatta, Mumbai should be termed as revolution then there is serious flaw in the way of thinking. It is sure cheating with the rural India. If we are talking about GDP and neglecting rural then we are committing crimes. It dials digital divide. Rural &#8211; Urban differentiation is like putting the clock back. Governmental schemes are implemented on paper only. Take example of Internet Dhabas.    In Internet Dhaba beneficiary was allotted waiting free, deposit free, rent free, Internet access free telephone connection. Such Dhabas (Kiosks) were supposed to be set at every Taluka level. The Principal General Managers who played God by taking credit of implementing this scheme was in facto demon. They allotted such phones on bribes. So in the age of Internet Nirvana rural India is Internet free and eventually virus free also. It is good to have virus in computer system than to have virus in minds like BSNL infected with bribe virus.    This challenging, feeble, depraved rural India needs Telecom God. They wish to throw up an inferior service provider like BSNL. A true Indian will always disdain &#8220;Hindustan-ke-Gaddar&#8221; in BSNL. Rural even doesn&rsquo;t wish to worship false telecom god and false telecom ministers. They need a deluxe telecom god who can provide them bribe free basic telephony at par with rest of the world and punish bribe licensee. It&rsquo;s so simple GDP is inversely proportional to bribe?

1135724,Internet,"             News from  urlLink The Hindu   While the IT and Telecom Minister Dayanidhi Maran is sulking (because his grandfather wants him to), new Information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy says he would like to see a different regulator for broadcasting.  The previous NDA government made a mess of CAS (Conditional Access System) and faced with massive resistance from all sections of the society, forced  urlLink TRAI  to be a regulator for broadcasting as well, besides the telecom space TRAI was regulating.  Since then TRAI has gotten into trying to understand the issues behind CAS as well as FM radio licensing issues. I had recently attended an open house session organized by TRAI in Chennai on FM and Cable TV related issues and was fairly impressed with Pradip Baijal, DP Seth and gang who were present.  There is no need to look for a different regulator, if the current bunch perform their job adequately. In fact, I am of the view that Telecom and broadcasting should be regulated by a single body as the future is  convergence . This is exactly what happens in USA:  urlLink Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  regulates 'interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite and cable'. In UK,  urlLink Office of Communications (Ofcom) , does precisely the same: 'regulating across television, radio, telecommunications and wireless communications services.' UK in fact brought the Telecom regulator and the various Broadcasting regulators together to create Ofcam only recently.           ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1135724,Internet,"             News from  urlLink The Hindu   Sorry for the corny title. Sayeed seems to indicate it is okay for any state to provide free power to any specific section of its people, provided the State Government makes allowance for the same in its budget, and pay the generation and supply company appropriately.  The new victorious Andhra Pradesh Government announced that farmers will get free power, thinking it was this issue which really threw Chandrababu Naidu of TDP to lose power. The Tamil Nadu state government headed by AIADMK which lost the  Lok Sabha  elections badly, also gave free power to its farmers.    urlLink However the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has clearly showed his unhappiness over giving away  any  utility free.  There are other ways of providing the subsidy, the one that was partially rolled out in Tamil Nadu, but has however been rescinded now. This method enforced setting up of electricity meters to all the farms, monitored the usage and asked the farmers to pay the electricity charges. The state government then paid this money back to the farmers as subsidy.  You may ask: 'What is the big difference?'  The difference is huge. In case of free power, there could be reckless usage. There is no monitoring. Also the farmers fear that, the subsidy amount may be restructured at a later stage. For example, a new governmental initiative may say all small farmers - those that use less than a certain amount of electricity and use a smaller field may get 100% subsidy, while the medium range farmer gets only 75% subsidy and large farmers get only 50% subsidy. Farmers, particularly the big ones, obviously do not like this. So they do not want to even open this area up and give in to Governmental pressure.  There is also the cash flow management - which is admittedly a problem for the small farmers. You have to pay upfront and then expect the money to come back to you from the government and this could take 3-4 months. Also unscrupulous officials can ask for bribes to release this money, or take a commission in this amount. However, such problems aside, the state governments will still have to institute this sort of a disciplined approach.  As we move towards private power distribution companies, we cannot live with this unmetered power distribution. While I am all for giving  measured, and justified  subsidies to farmers, the farmers will also have to be made aware that there is a cost to the Government in providing free power. One may even have to charge for agri water - perhaps a nominal charge - to encourage more sensible use of the water. There could be subsidies here too.  Then there is the issue of state fiscal deficit, if electricity is given free. The assumption by most of the states is that somehow centre will pick up the tab. When the states reel under pressure to pay the salaries (a bit on the higher side because of the fifth pay commission) of their employees, there is no money in the coffers. There is additional borrowing, which results in huge interest costs. It appears that a lot of state governments have very high cost debt, of money borrowed from the central government.  On other matters, PM Sayeed has given some statistics: Tenth Plan, 23,000 MW was being commissioned in the Central sector and 11,000 MW in the State sector; only 7,000 MW was being set up in the private sector. The total additional power generation target was 41,000 MW.  So we are massively behind target, and the private sector has not trumped up enough. The key job for the ministry would be to find more private participation (despite whatever the Left may say), so that they produce at least 50% of the target in the medium term, with the remaining 50% produced by State and Central.

1135724,Internet,"             From  urlLink The Financial Express   Power Minister PM Sayeed has listed his wishes to the Finance Minister in a letter dated 7th June 2004, in the run up to the budget making process. They are  Complete village electrification by the year 2007, and reaching electricity to all 7.8 crore rural households by 2009.  Since rural electricity delivery would cost significant money, increase of subsidy from 40% to 90% to rural consumers  To increase private investment in power generation, there is no sufficient risk capital available. To enable this setting up a India Power Fund, managed by Power Finance Corporation. The quantum of fund needed to kickstart this fund is Rs. 2,000 crores, and Sayeed would want the Finance Minister to offer Rs. 1,000 crores for this purpose. Sayeed expects this fund to be of the size Rs. 7,000 crores by 2010.  Relaxing the exposure limit set by RBI and IRDA on Banks, insurance companies and financial institutions on investing in power sector. Sayeed feels the current norms constrain flow of funds from the above bodies into this sector.

I still don't see the constitutional necessity for the principal at least in both houses for a state that has a bicameral legislature. States should be able to treat their regions and counties just as the United States Congress treats states for purposes of senatorial representation.   If anything, a freer hand in one house could very well represent diverse economic interests in the state more effectively. I know that would be the case in Tennessee, and would likely be so in any state of any geographical size. As long as one house is based on population distribution, the other house's districting should be reserved for the people to decide upon.  If one-man, one-vote is such an important principal, the Founders would never have authorized the US Senate (I know the purposes for the Senate were entirely different in its conception, but it still shows that there was some fudging to be done with a bicameral system regarding proportional representation).

I promised to be back to finis my weekend update, and, as my weekend has extended into today already, I guess I can continue the weekend update.  I'm not at work today. I was supposed to be but I called in this morning and took the day off. Or at least most of the day, I do have a phone conference at 1 that I really need to participate in so I'll try to get to work in time for that. In the mean time, already this morning I've met a guy and bought a Tracker motor from him, dropped the Tracker off at Les Schwab's Tire Store for an alignment, stopped by the insurance lady's office to add son Noah back onto my auto insurance policy, had breakfast at McDonalds and unloaded the motor out of my truck. Its 9:55 as I write this.  I've also got an Algebra mid-term test that is supposed to begin at 11:30 today, the Tracker won't be off the alignment rack until 11 and I still have to do some banking with Noah & Lily before they load up and depart on their 'Around the Northwest in 15 Days' tour. So I'm just relaxing, can't you see?  The kids are heading out today as soon as they get loaded up. they plan to be in Reno tonight, San Francisco the next day and spend the remainder of a week cruisisng north up the Pacific Coast Highway. They've got a new tent, new stove and lantern and enough groceries to last weeks if they get stuck going over Donner Pass. They also have a cell phone and enough money so that they won't be resorting to eating berries off bushes beside the road and brushing their teeth with bent sticks. They have maps and driving directions and an ATM card so they don't need to carry very much cash.  This does promise to be an exciting trip for the two of them. It willbe interesting to see if they are speaking when they get back! We will be meeting them a week from Thursday in  urlLink Nehelem State Park  in Oregon as we join up for the spouse's family weekend campout and get-together. It should be fun as always though the BSU is having fits about her sisters not approving of Noah & Lily's shared sleeping arrangements. Oh well!  BTW, the engine that I bought- $255 off of  urlLink EBay  and the seller lived just 70 miles away but had to pass through Ogden this morning and offered to bring it along and drop it off. So Noah and I met him at the truck stop and in 5 minutes time I was the happy owner of a spare Tracker motor. You might remember that I searched all the used engine providers in a 70 mile radius just a few weeks ago. The best price I could find was $850 for the same engine I just bought for $260. That's a much better price in my book! The guy selling really did goof I think by running his auction over the holiday weekend and ending it mid-day on the 5th. There was at least one other guy bidding on it but probably not very many others. And I sniped it like a bandit, holding off on my bid until just 20 seconds remained before closing! The bid jumped from $205 to $255 in those closing seconds and it ended up with my bid being the winning bid! Hah!  So, I gotta run. Guess I need to email my Algebra prof and tell him I'll be late or absent for today's portion of the test. Then its off to get the tracker off the alignment rack, finish the banking and kick these two kids down the road on their big adventure. More later. Maybe...             ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In case anyone's interested, The Italian Job is REALLY good.  Action, humor (big time) and a plot!  So...anyway, I hate my dad right now, again.  I'm also in Driver's Ed, which is kinda rough, since today was my first time behind the wheel since at least before Les Mis, so...but I did all right, I think.  If I pass all of this, all I'll have to take is a vision test @ some county DMV (hopefully Davidson since Williamson's sucks so much) and then I will be license bound!  But it's still a little nervewracking and I want to thank you for your support, Will.  Linds, please call me when you can on my cell.  I'll check at breaks and call you back.  I need to talk to you about something.  I'll see the rest of you tomorrow @ Fridays.  I'm assuming we're going to walk over to Thoroughbred, right?  If not, call me on my cell (you guys should have the number) and leave me a voicemail.  Anyway, gotta go zzzzzzz so I will talk to you tomorrow.  See you then!  ~Z      ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I probably won't check my e-mail but you can call 1-615-830-9683 and leave a message for me.

But whatever it is, I'm sorry.  5) Liz, I love your livejournal, cause of the 'song o'day' and the little thing that tells what mood you're in, especially.  6) Don't make fun of John Lennon's death.  It was a national tragedy.  I refuse to this day to read Catcher in the Rye.  7)  What does h4x4ur$ mean?  8)  Justine was actually there?  Does she have nothing better to do?  8)  Did you just say dawgs?  9) Jared just e-mailed me.  He's a sweet guy, slightly ADHD, but a good guy, all the same. 9) 1 month and 19 days till my b-day, but 1 month 21 days till I get my license.  I'm such a loozer.    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've got a stupidish song stuck in my head that I'll probably post here (if I can choke down the shame) and put on the second CD, it's an....uh......Avril Lavigne song.....put those rocks down...

SOme times I feel like maybe I'm a little too obsessed I guess... though I'm not sure that really makes sense... like maybe my faith means so much to me that it isn't really genuine     jazzboyj99 [7:53 PM]:  you don't have a genuine faith?   Soybeenchik847 [7:54 PM]:  I think I do, but sometimes I wonder if its not just me really needing something to hold on to, and overexaggerating my faith     jazzboyj99 [7:55 PM]:  why would you need something to hold on to   Soybeenchik847 [7:56 PM]:  because everything else that is important to me is really unstable     jazzboyj99 [7:57 PM]:  how strongly do you believe in the creed   Soybeenchik847 [7:58 PM]:  I think out of every part of the catholic church the creed is what makes the most sense to me     jazzboyj99 [7:58 PM]:  then your faith is fine   jazzboyj99 [7:58 PM]:  it outlines everything we, as catholics believe, and if you are in line with that   jazzboyj99 [7:58 PM]:  i don't see a problem   Soybeenchik847 [7:59 PM]:  yeah...     jazzboyj99 [8:00 PM]:  it's good that catholicism is stable for you   jazzboyj99 [8:00 PM]:  a lot of times one's religion is a very unstable part of their livse, and for you to say it is stable, is very cool   Soybeenchik847 [8:03 PM]:  Its the one thing that has remained constant since the day I was born...     jazzboyj99 [8:05 PM]:  so why this questioning of your genuine beliefs then   jazzboyj99 [8:05 PM]:  you can never lean on religion too much, it represents so much of who we are and what we believe   jazzboyj99 [8:05 PM]:  it impacts most of our daily lives   Soybeenchik847 [8:06 PM]:  because its something I've known since the day I was born... I never really had to work for it, it was just there, so how do I know its really real?     jazzboyj99 [8:06 PM]:  by applying to everything you do and living your faith   jazzboyj99 [8:10 PM]:  do you feel you do that   Soybeenchik847 [8:10 PM]:  I could always do better...     jazzboyj99 [8:14 PM]:  we all could   jazzboyj99 [8:14 PM]:  here's a secret, nobody is perfect   Soybeenchik847 [8:14 PM]:  really???

Catholicism is so deep and complex, I don't think I could ever be bored with it     jazzboyj99 [8:17 PM]:  lol ok   jazzboyj99 [8:17 PM]:  i used to be really bored with it   jazzboyj99 [8:18 PM]:  i didn't start this youth ministry track till like my junior year in college   Soybeenchik847 [8:19 PM]:  I think living with my mom, and being as involved as I am at church, there's always something I'm trying to understand... if not specifically about catechism, or how the church works, about who God is, or how my faith fits in with everything     Soybeenchik847 [8:20 PM]:  see... that's what I don't understand...  how come most people don't really know or understand their faith until they get older, and my main occupation right now is my faith?     jazzboyj99 [8:20 PM]:  maturity maybe, something grabbed you, and you rode it   jazzboyj99 [8:20 PM]:  i never had any spiritual influences in my life   jazzboyj99 [8:21 PM]:  i went to church because dad made me   jazzboyj99 [8:21 PM]:  and when i got more involved in college, things kind of took off   jazzboyj99 [8:21 PM]:  for every person it's something different   Soybeenchik847 [8:22 PM]:  yeah, I guess     jazzboyj99 [8:22 PM]:  what bothers you about it   jazzboyj99 [8:23 PM]:  you aren't allowed to have such a deep faith at your age?   Soybeenchik847 [8:24 PM]:  I don't know... just compared to most other people, it seems weird     jazzboyj99 [8:25 PM]:  what about that one dude at ncyc who started freeing children at age 12   Soybeenchik847 [8:26 PM]:  see that's something extraordinary, and nothing I'm doing compares to that... I meant compared to people who actually seem real to me     jazzboyj99 [8:26 PM]:  lol   jazzboyj99 [8:26 PM]:  why do you have to compare at all   Soybeenchik847 [8:26 PM]:  because that's what being a teenager is all about...     Soybeenchik847 [8:26 PM]:  lol     jazzboyj99 [8:27 PM]:  what you think adults don't compare?   Soybeenchik847 [8:27 PM]:  lol, well, then its just human nature in general     jazzboyj99 [8:28 PM]:  maybe   Soybeenchik847 [8:30 PM]:  I don't know.... Catholicism has always facinated me... I remember in 2nd grade this kid calling me a walking religion book, and when my mom started working in the Religious Ed. office at St. John's, I'd go in there twice a week or so, and be like, 'I have a question.'  and usually neither my mom or the DRE knew the answer, but they'd help me look it up     jazzboyj99 [8:31 PM]:  so you think because you are ahead of your times maybe your beliefs aren't as strong   Soybeenchik847 [8:31 PM]:  or maybe I'm just a nerd...     Soybeenchik847 [8:31 PM]:  lol     jazzboyj99 [8:31 PM]:  i'm a nerd, but that's common knowledge   jazzboyj99 [8:33 PM]:  i don't think you should worry about it   Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  speaking of being a nerd though, I should probably go finish some research for my theology paper     jazzboyj99 [8:34 PM]:  i think your faith is fine, unless you are seriously doubting right now   jazzboyj99 [8:34 PM]:  yeah, i have to study myself   Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  no, that was freshman year...     jazzboyj99 [8:34 PM]:  later   Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  I wanted to be jewish     Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  lol     Soybeenchik847 [8:34 PM]:  bye       ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1103084,Education,"       but there's never any new posts.  It's been like a week.    crazy!  i travelled to Kenyon College with the Debate Team this weekend and as i drove through the hills and curves of southeastern ohio i listened to local radio.  it's like a whole different world.  they're still playing the hits on the pop and country charts, but the rest of the programming sounds like a completely other universe than format radio in the city sounds.   There's none of the ethereal other worldly zooms or zaps or beeps.  No thunderously echoing DJ voices giving station promos between each ad and after each program.  The ads don't sound like they rolled out of New York and Nashville.  Instead, DJs chat with their call-in listeners for twenty minutes.  They chat about characters around town.  Old friends hijinks.  They laugh about ridiculous what-ifs.  They speculate about the high school basketball game in two nights.  The ads are read by the business owners and sound as raw as spoofs on Saturday Night Live.  The drive-time DJ makes guest appearances at Spitlers restaurant every weekend and broadcasts live from Fiedler's Ford every thursday morning.  He also calls the high school ball game, and intersperses his commentary with information about recent team injuries, family facts about the players and stories about how the two coaches got along when they were on the high school team together way back in the day.   Local radio reminds me of blogging.  The broadcasts seem idiosyncratic, quirky and unpredictable.  The cast of characters on many blogs is as expansive and unique as any one person's world.  But usually you can take comfort that no matter what happens in the lives of the DJs down at WTNS or WHBC -- the broadcast signal will not keep rolling.    So...I'll try to do better.  The plan is NOT to slack off on my backburner since i have tenure.  the *plan* is to slack off on my *frontburner* -- but I've got such a conscientious streak runnin through me...it's so hard to leave behind those habits...but that's a different blog.  peace out, faithful listeners~     ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Should stop going to pubs... as if I am so rich, even with the amount of cash on hand now, one day it is going to dry up again. Hmmm.... wonder who I puke on.  Today, was nice. Althought with the hang over, work is still nice. Busy Busy Busy... I beginning to believe that I am actually a workaholic... I need things to occupy my life, pack it so tight that I have no time to think of other things but what is there right then.  It was nice to drink with Sab and Mu just now. This Mu kept touching Sab... doesnt he knows that I am all alone now??? Hahaha... It was still good to see both of them so loving, was that was Shell wanted? Nay, I am not Mu, cant be so physical in public, a little hug and kiss is fine with others around but not the stuns of touching here and there like Mu. >_  Why am I up now? Coz she fades into my mind again... Mu asked, will you still take her back? Yah, if she is willing... he shakes his head and smile. What was that suppose to mean? Sab was saying that I just love her too much... Is it really that? I didnt want to show them that. More of wanted to show the me which has moved on... the me which is better... the me which enjoys work and has a life even when I am alone. There are many things to do, to be better, if she did come back.  Sab did mention that I look as if I can face the fact now. I did. I am at 'letting it go'. At least I know she is happy and so long she is happy. The article keep coming back about there are 4 person you will meet... You, The person who love you most, The person who you love most and the one you are going to marry. Yah, Seldom the person you love most is the one you are going to marry.. quite sad. Should always marry the person you love most... sigh.... time will heal all wounds, someday, I will stop dreaming about her.. someday, I will think of her as a very nice experience to have... someday.  Realised I still love her but somehow it is not the same kind of love that I had before. Not wanting her to be around all the time or knowing her every move... somedays I imagine that she is still my gal and she is out with her friends, happy, laughing and enjoying. That little moment feels to good and smiles... Yah, I love her but I can let her go now... can let her have all the things that she wants when she is happy. Amazed at how fast this changes the moment you set your mind to do it. So I did title this page correctly, Power of the mind, If you think you can... YOU CAN!   I have too many things to rattle today, have not talk enough, one bad thing of being alone is having no one to share your thoughts, no one to tell the story to, no one to live your life with you. So... who is the next in my life to go thru this? Have to start praying about it... Have this little urge to go to church, listen to Hymns, feel peaceful again. The training starts in less than 4 hours... think I am going to sleep thru the lectures again...   I have to sleep the entire day and not think of anything, speculating too much. Should I start looking at the shares again? Still feel like vomit now, think I ate too much at the fair. Can feel the headache coming... maybe its this stupid notebook. How to earn more money now, haha, actually feel the need for money so that I can go to pubs and relax for a while... Still dun really like my life but at least I can sleep a bit now...

It's just as well, I guess, since I see this more as a journal of my thoughts more than anything else.  This is my first Thanksgiving without my family, and had dinner at a friend's place instead.    It was a good meal, it was good company, I had a good time.  Things are different for me now, and as I race blindingly towards 30, I'm beginning to worry about where I'm going in life.

Being a 'professional dieter' myself I had assumed that EVERYONE knew what I knew about the content of food. Boy have I been surprised. My fiance' was/is pretty much CLUELESS about what he should eat when it came to micronutriants. It took me a little bit to figure out that he wasn't kidding when he came to me and said 'I need to eat more carbs, what can I have?' The education process has been interesting for both of us and we spent a GREAT deal of time in the store last night with him reading the lables of foods and me explaining what it all meant. He's currently at 2208 calories P/C/F Ratio 23/62/15. Should be intersting!                ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

108212,Student,"        YOU'VE GOT MAIL   Watched  Queen of the Damned  yesterday.. Not as bad a everyone said it was.  Not as good as I expected it to be either.  Spent the day hanging out with Jen.  But first, Brian and I took our two cats to the vet.. Oh, yeah!  I haven't told you guys yet.  Brian finally broke down and got me a kitten!  It's all black & super-cute!  His name is Felix.  We took Felix and Hobbie to the vet yesterday..  Then Brian went off to work and I stayed home with the full intention of veggin' out.  Jen calls me up to have lunch with her so I find myself getting up to go to Applebee's.  I buy lunch to bring to Brian for a mid-afternoon snack.  After lunch, Jen and I go to Planet Hair for my much-needed haircut.  My waist-length hair has been reduced to above the shoulders.. It's a modified bob.. Very much like the hairstyle that I had when I was a senior in high school.  Brings back memories..   Anyhow, we go shopping at the mall.  I took Jen to A&F and to Hollister Co. next door..  Redeemed my Express coupon.. Got some Orange Julius, etc.  After that we came back home to try on our finds.  Jen wanted to watch  Legally Blonde  one of my all-time favorite movies (I love Reese Witherspoon -- I can't wait until  Sweet Home Alabama  is released!).  We load it on the DVD and watch.. We wait for Brian to get home from work.  Dinner was at mom and dad's: porkchops & leftover sinigang.  Yum!  Did some karaoke on the 'magic mic.'  Watched the US Open women's finals..   This morning we had brunch with Brian's family at Legends.. Good food!  It's his mom's birthday tomorrow..  Anyway, we're going to go see  Swim Fan  later tonight with Kevin and Stephanie.  That should be good.  On Wednesday we get our Road Runner -- yippee!!  I'm so excited I don't think I'll be able to sleep for the next three days!    ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1079521,indUnk,"       Well my goodness.  It's been a while since I've done a 'real' update.   So, as you know, I survived my crazy week of camp and work.    First, I'll tell you about camp. It was quite different this year, with the new director.  She didn't plan nearly as much 'stuff' for the kids: education time, off 'campus' stuff (bowling, rollerskating, movies), or organized physical activity time.  So, this meant we had a LOT of free time with the kids, which is not good for the younger ones.  They all want to do something different, and it's hard to keep them all interested in the same things. My cabin, thank goodness, was quite satisfied with playing Red Rover and volleyball or 'dodgeball' most of the time.  Next year, there definitely needs to be some organized PE type events.  It's hard to play anything with just 10-12 kids.  We need everyone to play a real game of dodgeball, ya know?  And, for craft time, we worked on basically the same thing all week.  Most kids finished their craft (a wooden flower box) the first or second day.  SO, thankfully they came up with a few other options.   I had the 7-9 kiddos, most of which were all 'new'.  Most of the kiddos I've been with the last few summers have moved up to cabin 3.  They're all getting so old!  I might have to go to cabin 3 next year too so I can stay with the same group.  But, we had a very good cabin this year.  They were all very well behaved, a little loud at times, but they listened well.    The first day, we had water games, which was no good considering that was the coldest day of the week.  I wish I had remembered to take my camera with me that day, because I was the designated pump holder for the first part of it, while the kids were in the kiddie pool.  I had 2 around my neck, on the little pump belts, and 2 more (plus mine) clipped to my shorts.  It was funny.  Then, I decided I was no longer a safe, dry holder, so I took them all off.  Then, it was time to soak the counselors. The kids had super soakers, and got ahold of the hose a few times.  So, as if I wasn't wet enough from that, 2 of the guy counselors decided it would be funny to pick me up and toss me in the kiddie pool.  Thank goodness I had taken off my phone and pump by that point.  So, I was dripping, sopping wet for the rest of the afternoon.  Ooh, isn't that fun?  Of course it was.  =)  I had a change of clothes, so it was ok.  The others that got that wet, weren't as smart as me!!  heheh.  I forget what we did on Tuesday, I think the Forsyth County EMT people came with the ambulance.  We got to get in it and see, kinda fun.  We had some girl, just graduated from HS come talk to the kids about diabetes (she's had it a whopping 3 years!)  That was kind of dumb. I forget what else.. Wednesday it POURED.  There was a couple inches of water in the parking lot.  It was nasty. Luckily, it was close to going home time, so we didn't have to entertan the kids for too long inside.  I unearthed my 'Body art crayons' that I think KM or E got me for some birthday.  So I took those with me Thursday, and we did tattoos for a lot of our free time.  And, of course, signed shirts and stuff.  So I have yet another camp Enscore T-shirt with kid writing on it. lol.  That's really about it.  It was kinda boring this year, in terms of what we did.  The kids kept us busy, of course.  OH, I almost forgot!  Also on Thursday, we had those big inflatable slides and obstacle courses.  That was a trip!  I ran thru the bouncy obstacle course about 30 times, I bet.  And I got 'brush burns' on my knees, feet and elbows from sliding on the slide parts.  But, they were really fun!  I had to leave early Thursday night, so I didn't get to see the 'talent' show or the awards part to see how that went.. we'll see what next year brings.  Maybe I can help plan and get some more structure to it.. =)  I tell ya, one summer, I'm going to find a camp that goes more than a week and do that all summer!  There is this new camp that opened up in Randleman, I think it is, for chronically ill kids.  It's associated with Richard and Kyle Petty.  Dorothy told me about it before she left Baptist, but I forgot to check into it.  Maybe next year.. gotta get this internship done so I can get my degree.   Next:  work.  The first night I was there, I got to see a restraint first hand.  one of the girls pitched a fit and was coming after other people, so they had to chase her down, restrain her, hold her on the ground.  It was an event, let me tell ya. I was there until almost 11, supposed to have left at 9.  Talk about a long ass day.  The rest of the week was much calmer.  I don't know what else to say.  It wasn't too bad, I think I'll like it.  On my first real shift Friday night, we took them to the $3 movies and to Wal Mart, that was an ordeal.  First they had to all get gussied up to go out, then they had the radio BLASTING in the car (R&B/rap crap) and then had to be on the lookout for guys.  I tell ya. Thank god I didn't have to drive, I wouldn't have been able to handle it.  I can already tell there will be arguments when I do have to drive them somewhere.. I can not drive with that music that loud.   But, I think they're getting used to me well enough.  Of course, next week I'll be in the other girls cottage, so it'll be all 'new' again.  But, at least I know them.  I've not gotten to work with Becca or Melissa at all this week, which sucks. I'll see them both at least once next week, I think, for team meeting. Melissa is off to Nashville this weekend, I'm jealous.  I want to go visit!  That's about all for now, I must go to bed.  It's been a long day of lounging by the pool.  :-P  I'm off till Tuesday at 3, so I'm excited.  Tomorrow I'm hopefully gonna get to Pier 1 to get a Pampasan chair. Hailey's family sent me a $75 gift card for there, and the chair is on sale for $100, so I need to get it soon!  I don't knw where I'll put it, but ever since I slept in Amy's I've wanted one.  I should have just bought hers from her when she was selling it!  Ah well.   I've got some pics of camp to put up on webshots soon.. gotta get out the scanner first though.

1079521,indUnk,"       Oh my freakin' God.  I hate stupid drivers, and traffic in general.  Holy shit.   Ok, so first there's the Gatlinburg traffic mess.  It's worse than the beach during spring break, traffic backed up, only one main road to get everywhere, up and down 'the strip'.  It wasn't any where NEAR as bad as it was when I went with Robin, Mike, Paul & Justin, but still.  We actually stayed in downtown Gatlinburg, right on the strip, so we could walk to a lot of places.  BUt the ones that we couldn't, it took like 4 times as long as it should have, based on the distance away it was.   UGH.  And people won't let you turn left across traffic, it's crazy.   THEN, we FINALLY get to 40 and go for maybe an hour and a half, and we come to a HUGE mess, apparantly a tractor trailer wrecked and exploded and completely shut down the interstate   BOTH   ways.  I'm not sure if any thing was moving by the time we hit it, but by the time we got to a place we could detour and find an alternate route.. we called some people that left after us from Gatlinburg, and they were stopped about 50 miles back. JESUS!  That's insane.  So, we found a map and hopped off 40 via an   ON    ramp.. and stopped and reorganized.  I found the alternate route on the map and told them all how we should go, based on that.  Then we had to sit and talk about it for 15 more mins, cuz someone over heard bits of a conversation that said someone took 4 hours to go back roads around it, so some of the people were lik 'let's just get a hotel and stay here and leave at the ass crack of dawn'.  Uhm, HELL NO. Luckily there were other people that said that as well.  And, once we got going, we were fine.  A few little snag ups at some of the lights, but that's no biggie.  We found the first connection back to 40, but that was still a parking lot, so we went to the next one and it was moving nicely.  So, we were on our way, FINALLY.  We left the hotel at 10am, eastern time, and got home at about 5:30.  Part of that was stopping for breakfast at 2 places cuz the first one had a 90 min wait.  And, then stopping for gas and a potty break.  These people don't get the idea of a 'quick stop'!  ERGH.  Oh my goodness.   Other than that, the trip was pretty fun.  I won't do it again anytime soon, at least not with that many people.  I'd be fine going somewhere with just Trish & her family.  But coordinating what 10 people wanted to do, with no definite plan before we got there was no good.  People got ornery, etc.  I finally got to Hard Rock last night, last thing.  We went to the big aquarium, which I ended up having to pay for myself at.  I thought this was an all inclusive trip.. but I guess not.  Whatever.  I'm not doind that again, unless they offer to pay me too, or pay for the dogs.  They were a fun bunch of people tho, and so what we are all going to be like when we're 40.  Loud, crazy, and on crack!!  It's great.  I was thuroughly entertained.  :-)  Now, I have to type up some counseling session transcriptions and head to bed.  I want my puppies!!!  They're still at the kennel, cuz they don't open for pick up on Sundays.  What the hell is that?!  Schemin' people out of more money, that's what.            ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mean, it's actually really great, because it allows for people without much experience to edit their weblog without needing to know HTML (read: wimps). But I demand hardcode-ability! I'm an HTML veteran, I don't need these easy versions. I type out my code by hand! I'm a MAN! Woof! Grrr!  Right. Lessee, I should probably tell you that last week I went to my Uncle's house for two nights and had a blast. Wings and steak by day, movies and popcorn by night. Watched the western  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia  Thursday night and  Rocky IV  Friday night. Both really good movies. (Great, my dog just got up and tossed her cookies for no apparent reason. And we're out of paper towels.) Other'n that, we had a lot of fun. Lots of good conversation, and I managed to fix all their computer problems for them. I r00lz.  Man, I wish we had some paper towels.  Hmm, let's see, other than that... oh, we went to the library the other day. That was great. I picked up a whole lotta cool stuff. *'s next to things I needed for research for my newest novel (i.e. it was either a book on the 40's or a film noir).   Books:    The Age of Doubt: American Thought and Culture in the 1940's*      DVDs:    The Man Who Wasn't There*   The Third Man*   Monty Python's Life of Brian   Big Trouble   Office Space      VHS:    Touch of Evil*   The Big Sleep*   Detour*   Monty Python's Flying Circus vol3     Exciting, huh?! Yeah, I know, you're thrilled. The story's doing well, of course, though I need to finish up the plot. It'll probably be set around 1948... good old fashioned film noir detective story. No, not a Sherlock Holmes-esque bit, I'm talking  film noir.  Black film. Struggling private eyes, seductive femme fatales, crooked cops, shady characters, underhanded criminals,  blackmail  whitefemale*, betrayal, disguise, and deceit -- the works, baby. Best kind of movie out there if you ask me. A rainy night, a down-on-his-luck private dick, a damsel with a request, a twisted world where nothing is what you think it is... ohhh yeah, my kind of story. It's a thrill to be writing one of these.  By the way, I've only watched The Man Who Wasn't There and The Third Man since my trip to the library on Wednesday. The Third Man is a classic noir -- wonderful, wonderful story and dialogue and whatnot. I'd seen it before, and so I knew what to expect, but the DVD was remastered and all that and presented a brilliant reparation of the old film. I wouldn't mind owning that movie, to be honest. The Man Who Wasn't There was disappointing. I mean, it was a great movie, but some of Billy Bob Thornton's acting was overdone (he was supposed to play a quiet barber, but he played a TOO quiet, wooden barber), and a few sequences were rushed. Awesome twist at the end, though. This movie was the perfect example of the essence of noir: a sneaky proposition, a risky chance, and from there, a downhill mudslide. I felt very bad for Ed Crane: he only wanted an escape from the mundane, but a few baaad decisions made his life turn upside down and then fed it to a kraken. Like I said, it's really a great movie and I have nothing against it -- but I was expecting a lot more than what was presented to me. My expectations WERE rather high, though.  Anyhow, I'm off now. Mewd is typing something, and I don't know what it is. Wait, no, he sent the IM. Nevermind. G'night, folks!

Where DID it go? You know, 2003's been awfully funny. It seems like the year zipped by. I feel like I just took down the Christmas tree at the end of last Christmas. I feel like my dad just married my stepmom. I feel like I just had that sixteenth birthday party. I feel like I just saw my uncle at the Super Bowl party two months ago. And yet, at the same time, I feel like 2003 shouldn't be ending. Seriously. I feel like it's been 2003 for ages, and that it shouldn't change just yet. Why? I don't know. That's why I'm ranting about it. This year feels so funky.  Now, on to the meat of the blog entry:   What a freakin' year.   Lessee... 2003. What all happened? Well, my dad got married to my stepmom in Februrary. I turned sixteen in April. I got my domain name (mwahaha). Well, first I moved to ShadowOnline. THEN I left it and got my domain name. I had a job, for three weeks, then I got fired. Steve came to visit for a few days and put me to shame in Smash Bros. Melee. And most importantly, on June 23rd, Jessie and I started dating. It's been six months since we started now... wow. THAT shot by, fast. Hmm. Really fast.  Well, we're about to head out to dinner at the Olive Garden now. I still have to write a letter to Jessie telling her that I might not be on till later.

1016738,Publishing,"             A rather unsuccessful night out last night. Buoyed by the good weather (the last couple of days in Brighton have been just  gorgeous . By contrast it's pouring with rain right now, and I'm sitting here listening to the fire alarm going off and wondering who's burnt their lunch) we decided to go to the Hold Up alldayer, which was a 5pm-2am event at the Zap put on by the boys who do the DJ nights at the (ahem) Pavilion Tavern and Arc. It consisted of six or seven bands and a club thing.   Now, if we'd have thought about it in advance, we would probably have realised how bad it would be. The presence of  urlLink The Tenderfoot  on the bill notwithstanding, we hadn't heard of the other bands playing, and this is normally a recipe for Brighton-rocks style awfulness. Indeed, when we turned up we watched a band (whose name I shan't reveal) who were certainly amongst the worst bands I've seen in ten years of gig-going. Additionally, Hold-Up  the club  (at the Arc) is turgid; bad indie record after bad indie record. So putting the two together would never work.  To make matters worse, Vic is on antibiotics for her bad foot and I'm on the sympathy wagon, which meant neither of us were drinking. Reasoning that we could probably stick it out until  The Tenderfoot  came on and then escape immediately afterwards, we sat through the first band, some clueless DJing, and observed the rituals of a clientele all of whom seemed, bar us, to be explitly flouting the  over 18s only  rule.  Eventually, a band limbered up and began a laboured punk rock / john spencer / idiot-savant routine which was - frankly - the nail in the coffin. Actually, the nail in the coffin was when they announced 'We're the last band on tonight' and we realised we'd missed The Tenderfoot. We made way, hoping to find solace in a bar on Ship Street which was having an electroclash night. We tried it, but despite the excellent music - 'Deceptacon' by Le Tigre - we moved on elsewhere; it was overdressed and showy, and crap. Eventually we went for a (non-alcoholic, sigh) drink in the bar at the Joogleberry playhouse, which was, as it happens, lovely, although the fact that we had missed the food by moments didn't lift our mood much.  Still - I'm happy to report that 'The World's Wildest Police Videos' on C5 when we got back was  fine.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apparently every note is traceable back to the original LP, and I've just sought it out online and been listening to it. In short - it's absolute genius. It may be true that I'd sooner gnaw my own leg off than listen to the Beatles(s) version, but this is well worth the effort DM expended.

1015556,Technology,"                 Missiologists use the term 'indigenous' a lot.  Meaning that missions should not destroy the culture, but try to provide spiritual leadership, at some point, from within the culture.  I think the same thing applies to youth culture.  Most of you probably sense it quite often - students need to own the ministry.  You can (fill in the blank here - lead a talk, invite some kids, run a small group, etc.) and you will draw X number of kids.  Have a student help you or own it, and they will draw X*X number of kids.  Someone told me that the Univ of MD has the most Chinese foreign students in the US.  Their point was that if a person had a heart for Chinese, they should do ministry to the students at U of MD, for one student there could reach multitudes more Chinese than they ever could. It's one paradigm thats important with SPACE.  Here are two quick things I'm doing: - asked one Senior to write some devotionals for a middle school trip. - hoping a Junior will come on the middle school and do worship for me. I think both of these ideas have the indigenous concept as well as having older kids involved with the vision reach out with projects to the younger kids, forming more of that momentum.

1011289,indUnk,"              urlLink    A fish, a carp to be exact, was found the other day spouting Hebrew apocalyptic warnings. A few days ago, The Vatican reported that they had lost the keys of Heaven given to St. Peter, by Jesus Christ. There also was an issue about a week ago about a statue of Mary having too-prominent nipples. By these three things, I would assume that the end is near, in particular with the advent of that new reality show where the US picks a contestant's future mate.  Had dinner at East Side Marios this evening, although, truly, the monies accrued must be better spent than on food and books. However, I can rationalize and say: It's been a long time since either of us relaxed about anything. Although we aren't exactly relaxing at present, shouldn't we give it a try? Besides, on Monday, we go make appointments to get our eyes checked...soon we must pay rent and other crap.. might as well do fun things while the getting's good. Or is that completely irresponsible?

1005545,Engineering,"        Seth Godin   Came across the blog site  urlLink Seth's Blog . Seth writes in an iconoclastic manner, complete with tangential thoughts and lateral humor; thus living up to his strature of the ultimate entrepreneur of the year and a marketing guru. I think this blog is going to be added in my everyday-visits site list. Check it out. Its amazing. Herez an article from his site, that he posted:   Naming a business  Greg Harrington writes, 'I’ve been thinking quite a bit about a topic lately—how to best name a business—and in looking for some ideas, I’ve reviewed several of your books, but don’t find anything in the way of a thorough treatment of this topic.'  Here's what I think: First, the main point: a brand name is a peg that people use to hang all the attributes of your business. The LESS it has to do with your category, the better. If you call yourself International Postal Consultants, there's a lot less room to hang other attributes. Some names I like? Starbucks. Nike. Apple.  Second, please pick a real english word, or a string of them. Axelon and Altus are bad. Jet Blue, Ambient and Amazon are good.  Third, be sure it's easy to spell AND pronounce. Prius is a bad name. I can't tell anyone to buy a Prius because I'm embarrassed I'll say it wrong.  Fourth, don't obsess about getting a short web name. If you want to name your venture capital firm Nickel (a great name, imho) then you could have www.NickelVenture.com and that would be fine. The only way this turns into a problem is if the current owner of the URL is a competitor (which won't happen if you pick a non-obvious name, as I write in #1 above).  If you follow these pieces of advice, you'll discover that there are literally millions of names available to you (lemonpie, for example, is perfect for a scuba tour company. So are orangepie, melonpie and kiwipie). You will have far fewer trademark hassles. You will have no trouble coming up with a cool name that means nothing and makes it easy for you to hang a good brand upon. And you'll have fun.  BUT, don't forget to come up with a great tagline. 'lemonpie, the easy way to learn scuba,' for example.  PS a couple more tricks:  1. Use a stock photo CD and find cool pictures that match your name BEFORE you pick the name. If you can find a bunch of $30 images that work with a name, grab the pictures, then the name.  2. Don't listen to anyone else. All your friends will hate it. GOOD. They would have hated Starbucks too (you want to name your store after something from Moby Dick!??) If your friends like it, run.          ",0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anyway, I found this somewhere in there, and I want to re-post it so that I keep remembering it.   Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking. It is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. -1 Corinthians 13:4-8  :) I love it. I love the Bible. I love God!!! Sometimes, I think people think I'm some heathen atheistic person, and I'm completely not. It's completely the other way around. I just like to worship God in my own way, and my own way is a quiet way. I don't like to push my views on other people. People who try to push their views on others really bother me. I love God, and have complete faith in him. That's all I need to know. If other people don't believe that, nothing I say will change their minds. That's why I don't understand why so many wars are faught over God. Don't you realize you're doing what God doesn't want you to do?? You're killing, and  argh. Has this war over God ever been resolved?? No, because not everyone worships God in the same way or worships him at all. It bothers me so much. Let people believe what they want to believe.
