If possible, I want to be buried next to the grave where my mom sleeps. My mom’s name is Dicea Menezes de Oliveira and she is buried in the Murundu cemetery. I need to be visited at my grave by a faithful follower of God at least once, he must pray in front of my grave and ask God’s forgiveness for what I did praying that upon his return Jesus wakes me from the sleep of death for eternal life. I left a house in Sepetiba which no family needs, there are poor institutions, financed by generous people, that take care of abandoned animals, I want this space where I passed my final months donated to one of these institutions, because the animals are being very despised and need much more protection and care than human beings who have the advantage of being able to communicate, to work to feed themselves, so those who take ownership of my house, I ask you to please have some common sense and abide by my request, automatically they will be fulfilling the wishes of my parents who wanted to pass this property to my name and everybody knows this, comply with my request otherwise they automatically will be disrespecting my parents’ wishes, which would prove that all of you have no consideration for our parents who now sleep, I believe that all of you have some consideration for our parents, proving this by doing what I asked",1

eugenics Natural Selectors Manifesto
How Did Natural Selection Turn Into Idiocratic Selection?
Today the process of natural selection is totally misguided. It has reversed. Human race has been 
devolving very long time for now. Retarded and stupid , weak-minded people are reproducing more 
and faster than the intelligent, strong-minded people. Laws protect the retarded majority which
selects the leaders of society. Modern human race has not only betrayed its ancestors, but the future 
generations too. Homo Sapiens, HAH! It is more like a Homo Idioticus to me! When I look at 
people I see every day in society, school and everywhere... I cant say I belong to same race as the 
lousy, miserable, arrogant, selfish human race! No! I have evolved one step above! 
Naturality has been discriminated through religions, ideologies, laws and other mass delusion 
systems. Individual, who is going through his/hers natural power process and trying to live 
naturally, but is being told that the way he acts or thinks is wrong and stupid, will usually have 
some reactions which might be considered as ""psychological disorders"" by the establishment. In 
reality they are just natural reactions to the disruption of natural power process. They will have 
some of the following (depending on individual's personality): feelings of inferiority / superiority, 
hostility, aggression, frustration, depression, self-hatred / hatred towards other people, suicidal / 
homicidal thought etc... and it is completely normal.
Humans are just a species among other animals and world does not exist only for humans. Death 
and killing is not a tragedy, it happens in nature all the time between all species. Not all human lives 
are important or worth saving. Only superior (intelligent, self-aware, strong-minded) individuals
should survive while inferior (stupid, retarded, weak-minded masses) should perish.
There is also another solution to the problem: stupid people as slaves and intelligent people as free. 
What I mean is that they who have free minds, are capable of intelligent existential and 
philosophical thinking and know what justice is, should be free and rulers... and the robotic masses, 
they can be slaves since they do not mind it now either and because their minds are on so retarded 
level. The gangsters that now rule societies, would of course get what they deserve.
Of course there is a final solution too: death of entire human race. It would solve every problem of 
humanity. The faster human race is wiped out from this planet, the better... no one should be left 
alive. I have no mercy for the scum of earth, the pathetic human race.",1
"7","PekkaEricAuvinen","Manifesto","Collective Deindividualization: Totalitarianism & Delusions Of Democracy
Collective deindividualization is a phenomenon where individual will be trained as part of the 
mindless herd controlled by state, corporation, church or some other organization, group, ideology, 
religion or mass delusion system and adopt it's rules, morality and codes of conduct. This 
phenomenon has been familiar in all despotic, authoritarian, totalitarian, monarchist, communist, 
socialist, nazi, fascist and religious societies troughout history. Also, the modern western 
democratic republics have the same phenomenon. It is just done so that people will think they are 
free and don't realize they are being enslaved. Majority of people in society are weak-minded and 
ignorant retards, masses that act like programmed robots and accept voluntarily slavery. But not 
me! I am self-aware and realize what is going on in society! I have a free mind! And I choose to be 
free rather than live like a robot or slave. You can say I have a god complex, sure... then you have 
a group complex! Compared to you retarded masses, I am actually godlike.
Totalitarian governments rule people through education system, consumerism, mass media, 
monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force (police, military) and laws discriminating people 
who think differently than the majority. Democracy... you think democracy means freedom and 
justice? You are wrong. Democracy is a dictatorship of the moral majority... and the majority is 
manipulated and ruled by the state mafia. Modern western democracy has nothing to do with 
freedom or justice; it is totalitarian and corrupted system. Laws are made over the heads of the 
people and people are being brainwashed to support the system and connected to the institutional 
structures immediately after their birth. Societies are being ruled by manipulative and charismatic 
politicians who only care about the interests of majority, and who do not base their decisions on 
reason but emotions and feelings of the masses. These masses let the authorities of state to make all 
the important decisions for them. The masses will get an education, they study, get a job, go to 
work and vote in elections. They think they are free and dont criticise or question the system. They 
have become robots. It is like a constructed mechanism in mind, that leaves little choice for an 
individual to think, talk and act independently.
Three Kinds Of Humans There are three kinds of human personality types in this world: individualistic human (3% of the world population) manipulative human (3% of the world population) mass human (94% of the world population) #1 & #2 type of personalities are intelligent, creative and self-aware. They have chosen bit different 
paths paths. #3 type of personalities are less intelligent and less creative, weak-minded people 
controlled by #2 type of personalities. The percentages are only estimations though but are based on 
Gaussian distribution and history of human race and how humans have organized into societies. 
And this is the way it has always been ever since humans started to organize into communities.
Another way how to divide people is bit different but is based on the same facts, human nature and 
history. The division is based on the level of intelligence and quality of mentality:
1) intelligent (3% of the world population)
2) slightly retarded, so called normal people or robots (94% of the world population)
3) highly retarded, vegetables (3% of the world population)
Total War Against Humanity
Hate, Im so full of it and I love it. That is one thing I really love. Some time ago, I used to believe in 
humanity and I wanted to live a long and happy life... but then I woke up. I started to think deeper 
and realized things. But it was not easy to become existential... knowing as much as I know has 
made me unhappy, frustrated and angry. I just cant be happy in the society or the reality I live. Due 
to long process of existential thinking, observing the society I live and some other things happened 
in my life... I have come to the point where I feel nothing but hate against humanity and human 
race.
Life is just a meaningless coincidence... result of long process of evolution and many several 
factors, causes and effects.",1
"8","PekkaEricAuvinen","Manifesto","However, life is also something that an individual wants and determines 
it to be. And I'm the dictator and god of my own life. And me, I have chosen my way. I am prepared

psychopath, criminal or crap like that. No, the truth is that I am just an animal, a human, an 
individual, a dissident.
I have had enough. I dont want to be part of this fucked up society. Like some other wise people 
have said in the past, human race is not worth fighting for or saving... only worth killing. But... 
When my enemies will run and hide in fear when mentioning my name... When the gangsters of the 
corrupted governments have been shot in the streets... When the rule of idioracy and the democratic 
system has been replaced with justice... When intelligent people are finally free and rule the society 
instead of the idiocratic rule of majority... In that great day of deliverance, you will know what I 
want. 
Long live the revolution... revolution against the system, which enslaves not only the majority of 
weak-minded masses but also the small minority of strong-minded and intelligent individuals! If we 
want to live in a different world, we must act. We must rise against the enslaving, corrupted and 
totalitarian regimes and overthrow the tyrants, gangsters and the rule of idiocracy. I cant alone 
change much but hopefully my actions will inspire all the intelligent people of the world and start 
some sort of revolution against the current systems. The system discriminating naturality and 
justice, is my enemy. The people living in the world of delusion and supporting this system are my 
enemies.
I am ready to die for a cause I know is right, just and true... even if I would lose or the battle would 
be only remembered as evil... I will rather fight and die than live a long and unhappy life.
And remember that this is my war, my ideas and my plans. Dont blame anyone else for my actions

About 30 minutes into the movie, police say, around 12:30 a.m., he reentered the theater through the exit door. Holmes was dressed in black and wore a gas mask, a load-bearing vest, a ballistic helmet, bullet-resistant leggings, a bullet-resistant throat protector, a groin protector, and tactical gloves. He was listening to techno music through a set of headphones so that he could not hear anything from people in the theater. Initially, few in the audience considered Holmes to be a threat.

Because they lack power and control in their lives. The fantasy of hurting others is a power based fantasy. It stems from the desire to have more control over others. Generally speaking, people who have these fantasies are suffering in their own lives. Maybe a person is struggling because he or she is not part of the in crowd. Perhaps someone they like doesn’t like them back. They might feel rejected. Feelings of rejection can be quite painful. Homicidal fantasies might develop as a way to compensate for the painful feelings of rejection. There are other reasons as well.

"13","MarcLepine","Suicide Note","Would you note that if I commit suicide today 89-12-06 it is not for economic reasons (for 
I have waited until I exhausted all my financial means, even refusing jobs) but for political 
reasons. Because I have decided to send the feminists, who have always ruined my life, to 
their Maker. For seven years life has brought me no joy and being totally blasé, I have decided 
to put an end to those viragos. I tried in my youth to enter the Forces as an officer cadet, which would have allowed me possibly to get into the arsenal and precede Lortie in a raid. They refused me becauase antisocial. I therefore had to wait until this day to execute my plans. In between, I continued my 
studies in a haphazard way for they never really interested me, knowing in advance my fate. 
Which did not prevent me from obtaining very good marks despite my theory of not handing 
in work and the lack of studying before exams. Even if the Mad Killer epithet will be attributed to me by the media, I consider myself a 
rational erudite that only the arrival of the Grim Reaper has forced to take extreme acts. For 
why persevere to exist if it is only to please the government. Being rather backward-looking 
by nature (except for science), the feminists have always enraged me. They want to keep 
the advantages of women (e.g. cheaper insurance, extended maternity leave preceded by a 
preventative leave, etc.) while seizing for themselves those of men. us it is an obvious truth that if the Olympic Games removed the Men-Women distinction, there would be Women only in the graceful events. So the feminists are not fighting 
to remove that barrier. They are so opportunistic they [do not] neglect to profit from the 
knowledge accumulated by men through the ages. They always try to misrepresent them 
every time they can. Thus, the other day, I heard they were honoring the Canadian men 
and women who fought at the frontline during the world wars. How can you explain [that 
since] women were not authorized to go to the frontline??? Will we hear of Caesar’s female 
legions and female galley slaves who of course took up 50% of the ranks of history, though 
they never existed. A real Casus Belli. Sorry for this too brief letter. Nearly died today. The lack of time (because I started too late) has allowed these radical 
feminists to survive.",1

"16","GangLu","Letter","How are you! Please deposit the enclosed check in the back speedily. This letter is written 
especially to you, so don’t let other people in the family see it. When you read this letter, 
I will probably no longer be in the world of the living. I have already mailed some things 
back, which can be considered to constitute my legacy. I think that as long as you explain 
it to the customs officials, they will let these things pass through, just as if I had brought 
them back myself. 
What I am most worried about is our parents; they are old, and I am afraid they will not be 
able to bear this turmoil. But I am at the end of my resources, so this heavy responsibility 
must fall on your shoulders. I beg you to take care of them and spare no expenses in the 
effort. Moreover, don’t spend any money on a funeral for me. And by all means don’t come 
to the U.S. to take my body home. The best thing would be to let the Chinese embassy have 
my body cremated here in the U.S., and just send some ashes back. Keep firmly in mind 
that you should not let anyone here in the U.S. blackmail you into paying anything. I think 
the money I have sent back will suffice to repay our parents’ loving kindness in raising me 
and the gentle care my two elder sisters gave me when I was young.
Last night when I finished talking with you on the telephone, I wept my heart out here alone. 
For the life of me, I can’t swallow all this. You know that all my life I have been honest and 
straightforward, and I have most of all detested cunning, fawning sycophants and dishonest bureaucrats who think they are always right in everything. I had this in mind for a long 
time, but I persevered until I had taken my doctoral degree. This was an honor for the whole 
family. You yourself should not be too sad about it, for at least I have found a few traveling 
companions to accompany me to the grave. 
My experiences during my 28 years have caused me to adopt a rather jaundiced view of human existence; I have on occasion said to people that I would like to take orders as a Buddhist 
monk. There is no end to the hopes and desires in human life. In the U.S., even though 
there are no worries about food and clothing, up above there are still exalted, rich people, 
and compared with them I am poor as a church mouse. To sum up, on my own behalf I have 
vented my rage, and on behalf of my family I have provided a safeguard for their livelihood. 
What further expectations do I have to live for? Hence it has been said of old: “After a long 
drought to encounter the sweet rains, in a different place to meet an old friend, to burn the 
candle in one’s wedding chamber, and to see one’s name listed on the golden placard of successful examination candidates.” I have tasted all of these four great objects of a man’s life, 
and it can truly be said that I have known satisfaction!
Though I am single, I have had a few girlfriends. When I lived in the dormitory in high 
school I had already started to have girlfriends. When I went to college I often slipped into 
our old home at the Number 262 Hospital under cover of darkness and spent the night with girls. After I came to the States I had liaisons with Chinese and American women, with 
single and married women, with girls of good families and girls of the streets. I just don’t 
have a constant heart in these matters; the grass always looks greener somewhere else, and 
I can’t be satisfied with any particular person. Maybe I didn’t meet the right one, or perhaps 
I thought either that they were too good for me or I was too good for them. No matter what 
the answer is, I feel a bit fed up with male-female relationships. 
Moving on to another point I have already lost interest in physics, at which I labored for ten 
years (four in college and six years in graduate school); one could say I felt more and more 
that I had entered a dead-end street. The study of physics is more and more disappointing. 
The way it is now, one person says one thing, another says something else, and nobody 
really knows what’s going on. So people form a number of factions based around different 
universities, each side attacking the other while grandly touting their own views as correct. 
No wonder that there are people who say, “Modern physics is self-delusion.” I regret a bit 
that at the outset I did not study a more practical subject. But what can be done about it now? 
Our parents themselves were ignorant of these things and could not guide me in educational 
matters. I had to blunder on all by myself. Lots of Chinese physicists with U.S. citizenship, 
who had been messing around in the U.S. and weren’t happy any more, returned to China 
for visits and bragged that in doing so they were making a contribution to their fatherland. 
And so then the Chinese government started propagandizing on a grand scale and beguiled 
the young people in to studying the theoretical sciences. 
But, to get back to what I was saying earlier, if I had at the outset studied medicine, I could 
not possibly have come to the U.S. to study for a degree and earn American currency. Our 
parents did not have the economic resources to send me to the U.S. for advanced study. 
Some people at this school who are in the applied sciences, their parents are for the most 
part high-level intellectuals who have studied abroad. Their families have foreign currency, 
which they can use to enable their children to take the TOEFL and the GREs, and to defray 
their tuition and living expenses. Or they have relatives living abroad who can lend them 
money. That today I have come to this pass can justly be said to be partly the fault of our 
parents. I truly believe the saying, “In life be a paragon among men, and in death be a hero 
among the shades.” I take personal responsibility for all that I have done.
And another thing, in the end it would be best not to let the younger generation (of our 
family) know how it really was with me, for it might be disadvantageous to their futures. My 
beloved elder sister, I take my eternal leave of you. Your younger brother.",1

If a man chooses to speed while driving home one day then it is his fault for whatever happens. If he crashes into a school bus full of kiddies and they all burn to death, it’s his fault.

We aren’t \nGODS, just because we are at the top of the food chain with our technology doesn’t mean we can be “judges” \nof nature.

I think we are all a waste of natural \nresources and should be killed off, and since humans have the ability to choose . \xa0.\xa0. and I’m \nhuman . \xa0.\xa0. I think I will choose to kill and damage as much as nature allows me to so take \nthat, fuck you, and eat napalm + lead! HA! Only nature can stop me. I know I could get shot by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that one person so get over it! It’s MY fault! Not my parents, not my brothers, not my friends, not my favorite bands, not computer games, not the media. IT is MINE! Go shut the fuck up!\n-REB-  7/29/98\nSomeone’s bound to say “what were they thinking?” when we go NBK or when we were \nplanning it, so this is what I am thinking. “I have a goal to destroy as much as possible so I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy, mercy, or any of that, so I will force \nmyself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom like FH [Former Human, \nmob in Doom] or FS [Former Sergeant] or demons, so it’s either me or them. I have to turn off my feelings.” Keep this in mind, I want to burn the world, I want to kill everyone except about 5 people, who I will name later, so if you are reading this you are lucky you escaped my rampage because I wanted to kill you. It will be very tricky getting all of our supplies, explosives, weaponry, ammo, and then hiding it all and then actually planting it all so we can achieve our goal. But if we get busted any time, we start killing then and there, just like Wilks from the ALIENS books [comic books], I ain’t going out without a fight.",1
"23","EricHarris","Journal","Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max \nin the school alone who I don’t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE! If I didn’t like you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god damn NIGGER. Pity that a lot of the dead will be a waste in some ways, like dead hot chicks who were still bitches, they could have been good fucks. Oh well, too fucking bad. Life isn’t fair.\n\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. not by a long fuckin shot when I’m at the wheel, too. God I want to torch and level \neverything in this whole fucking area but bombs of that size are hard to make, and plus I would need a fuckin fully loaded A-10 to get every store on Wadsworth and all the buildings \ndowntown.

Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car garages blowing up from exploded gas tanks.\n\xa0.\xa0.\xa0. oh man that would be beautiful.\n10/23/98\nYou know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just \nto keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I don’t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Let’s see, what are some big lies I have told; “yeah I stopped smoking;” “for doing it not for getting caught,” “no I haven’t been making more bombs,” “no I wouldn’t do that,” and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, \nunless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. \nSome people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people I wouldn’t want to die, but hey, who ever said life is fair should be shot like the others, too.\nKKK  [swastika drawing] SS [American flag drawing]\n11/1/98\nHeh heh heh. I sure had fun this weekend. Let’s see, what really happened. Before going to \nRock-n-Bowl we stopped by King Soopers and me and \n picked up some big ass stogies. \nWe then went to Rock-n-Bowl and I had a few cigarettes and one of my brand new cigars. \nWe then went back to ’s house where her mom had previously bought us all a fuck \nload of liquor. Personally I had asked for Tequila and Irish cream, Vodka got his Vodka, and there was beer, whiskey, schnapps, puckers, scotch, and of course, orange juice! So we had some fun there playing cards and making drinks. We eventually made it to bed at about 5 AM. Got up at 10, went to Safeway got some doughnuts and then I took Vodka home. The bottle of Tequila is almost full and is in my car right by my spare tire and right by the bottle of Irish Cream. Heh heh. I’ll have to find a spot for those. And by the way, this Nazi report13 is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That’s how Nazism was formed, and that’s how I will be too!\n11/8/98\n13 Eric wrote a school paper on the Nazis during the fall of his senior year. There are several drafts \namong the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office documents. See pp. 25,964-78 for one version.p. 26,013\np. 26,014WWW.SCHOOLSHOOTERS.INFO Peter Langman, Ph.D. Version 1.3 (3 October 2014) 8Fuck you Brady!14 All I want is a couple of guns, and thanks to your fucking bill I will \nprobably not get any! Come on, I’ll have a clean record and I only want them for personal \nprotection. It’s not like I’m some psycho who would go on a shooting spree. \xa0.\xa0.\xa0. fuckers. I’ll \nprobably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collector’s house. Fuck, \nthat’ll be hard. Oh well, just as long as I kill a lot of fucking people. Everyone is always \nmaking fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get you all back, ultimate fucking revenge here.15 You people could have shown more respect, treated me better, asked for my knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior, and maybe I wouldn’t have been so ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even \nthinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. That’s where a lot of my hate grows \nfrom. The fact that I have practically no self-esteem, especially concerning girls and looks and such. Therefore people make fun of me .\n\xa0.\xa0. constantly . \xa0.\xa0. therefore I get no respect and \ntherefore I get fucking PISSED. As of this date I have enough explosions to kill about 100 people, and then if I get a couple bayonets, swords, axes, whatever I’ll be able to kill at least 10 more. And that just isn’t enough!\nGuns! I need guns! Give me some fucking firearms!\n11/12/98\nHATE! I’m full of hate and I love it. I HATE PEOPLE and they better fucking fear me if they \nknow what’s good for ’em. Yes I hate and I guess I want others to know it, yes I’m a racist and I don’t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very \nracist towards white trash P.O.S.’s [piece of shits] like  and  they deserve the hatred, \notherwise I probably wouldn’t hate them. It’s a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead \nto their downfall. People’s human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, it’s happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Min-nesota who squealed.16 Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are and why and I can’t stand it! I love the Nazis too .\n\xa0.\xa0. by the way, I fucking can’t get enough \nof the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good. Every form of government leads to downfalls, everything will always fuck up or yeah something. It’s all doomed, god damn it. This is beginning to make me get in a corner. I’m showing too much of myself, my views and thoughts, people might start to wonder, smart ones will get nosy and something might happen to fuck me over, I might need to put on one helluva mask here to fool you all some more. Fuck fuck fuck. It’ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give \nme more compliments all of this might still be avoidable .\n\xa0.\xa0. but probably not. Whatever I \ndo people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I’ll get revenge soon enough. \nFuckers shouldn’t have ripped on me so much huh!17 Ha! Then again it’s human nature to do what you did .\n\xa0.\xa0. so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can’t take it, it’s not \nright . \xa0.\xa0. true . \xa0.\xa0. correct . \xa0.\xa0. perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be \nfucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions.",1

This is a bitch trying to keep up with homework while working on my guns, bombs, and lying. By the way, I bought that flask in the mall and I had a friend fill it up with scotch whiskey, only had about 3 swigs in the 3 weeks I had it. Plus Monday I gave my T and IC [tequila and Irish cream] to Vodka, just in case. I never really did like alcohol, just wasn’t my thing, but it felt good to just have around.

"27","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","Humanity…  All of my suffering on this world has been at the hands of humanity, particularly women. It has made me realize just how brutal and twisted humanity is as a species. All I ever wanted was to fit in and live a happy life amongst humanity, but I was cast out and rejected, forced to endure an existence of loneliness and insignificance, all because the females of the human species were incapable of seeing the value in me.        This is the story of how I, Elliot Rodger, came to be. This is the story of my  entire  life. It is a dark story of sadness, anger, and hatred. It is a story of a war against cruel injustice. In this magnificent story, I will disclose every single detail about my life, every single significant experience  that I have pulled from my superior  memory, as well as how those experiences have shaped my views of the world. This tragedy did not have to happen. I didn’t want things to turn out this way, but humanity forced my hand, and this story will explain why. My life didn’t start out dark and twisted. I started out as a happy and blissful child, living my life to the fullest in a world I thought was good and pure…   Part One  A Blissful Beginning  Age 0 -5       On the morning of July 24th, 1991, in a London hospital,  I was born. I breathed in the first breath of life as I entered this world, weighing only 5.4 pounds.  My parents must have been filled with happiness and pride  that day. They had just witnessed the birth of their first child, and they named me Elliot Oliver Robertson Rodger.       I was born to young parents. My father, Peter Rodger, was only  26 when he impregnated my mother, Chin, who was 30. Peter is of British descent, hailing fro m the prestigious Rodger family;  a family that was once  part of t he wealthy upper classes  before they  lost all of their fortune during the Great Depression.  My father’s father , George Rodger, was a renowned photojournalist who had taken very famous photographs  during the Second World War, though he failed to reacquire the family’s lost fortune.  My mother is of Chinese descent. She was born in Malaysia, and moved to England at a young age to work as a nurse on several film sets, where she became friends with very important  individuals in the film industry, including George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. She even dated George Lucas for a short time.        My mother and father had been married for a couple of years before my mother became pregnant with me. In fact, her pregnancy was an accident. She had been taking pills to prevent pregnancy, but when she visited my father on one of his film sets, she fell ill and the medication she took for that illness thwarted the effect of the anti -pregnancy pills, and so their lovemaking during this period resulted in my life.      Only a couple of months after my birth, I went on my first vacation. My parents took me on a boat to France. I was already a traveler! Of course, I have no memories of this trip. My mother said that I cried a lot.  [1]     At the time that I was born, my mother and father were living in a house in London, but shortly after my birth they decided to move to the countryside. We moved to a large house made of red brick in the county of Sussex, with vast grass fields surrounding it. The house even had a name:  The Old Rectory. This was where I spent  my early childhood, the first five years of my life, and it was beautiful. The memories I have of this period are only memories of happiness and bliss.       My father was a  professional photographer at the time, just in the stage of becoming a director. M y mother gave up her nursing career to stay at home and look after me. My grandma on my mother’s side, who I would call Ah Mah, moved in with us to help out my mother. I would spend a lot of time with Ah Mah during these years .      This was a time of discovery, excitement, and fun. I had just entered this new world , and I knew nothing of the pain it would bring me later on. I enjoyed life with innocent bliss. I can remember playing in the fields  and going on long walks with Ah Mah to pick berries. She would always warn me not to touch the stinging nettles that sometimes grew in our fields, but my curiosity got the better of me, and I got stung a few times. There was a swing in the back of our yard, which I had many good times on.       The first birthday I remember was  my 3rd birthday. My parents threw a party for me in our field. I had a helicopter birthday cake. I can remember one of my friend’s parents cutting off the first piece and giving it to my friend. I threw a tantrum because I was expecting to get  the first piece… It was my birthday after all. My father bought me a toy tractor that I could ride around in, and I would play with it all the time after that.       Sometime after my 3rd birthday, we all went on a vacation to Malaysia, my mother’s home country. I have only flashes of memory of that vacation. I enjoyed  it very much. We visited a few of my mother’s relatives.        For preschool, I was enrolled at Dorsett House, an upscale all-boys private school in the countryside, near where we lived. I was forced to wear a uniform, which I hated because I had to wear uncomfortable  socks up to my knees. I was very nervous and I cried on my first day there. I can remember two friends I made by name, George and David. I would always play in the sandpit with t hem.        I didn’t like school at Dorsett House very much. I found the rules to be too strict.  My least favorite part of it was the football sessions. I never understood the game and I could never keep up with the other boys in the field, so I always stood by the goal -keeper and pretended to be the “second goal -keeper”. My favorite part was playing in the woods after lunch. There was a particular  climbing structure that I had a lot of fun with.       My preschool class once went on a field trip to the park,  where I had the misfortune of getting lost . As my class was eating lunch, I ventured off to another area of the park, and when I returned, my class had moved on. I remember panicking and asking strangers for help.  It was a terrifying experience for me. I was eventually led to my class by the strangers I talked to.       I remember one funny incident when we were taking school pictures. They forced us to sit cross -legged, which I hated doing, so I absolutely refused to sit that way for the picture. The teachers eventually conceded, and the picture was taken with me being the only one sitting differently.        The holiday season was the best part of the year for me. It must have been very cold in England, but I don’t remember the cold. I just remember how much fun I had. I was filled with joy when it started snowing outside – I loved playing in the snow. My  father helped me build a snowman once. We would start with little snowballs, and roll them around our field until we formed the body, and then we would decorate it.       During Christmas, my parents always had parties and gatherings.  My father’s best friend, Christopher Bess, who was also my godfather, came  to our house  frequently.  We would often go to my father’s parent’s house in Smarden, Kent. I would call my grandmother on my father’s side “grandma Jinx”. My [2]memories of my grandfather , George  Rodger,  are faint; he had fallen very ill at this period. My father’s brother, uncle Jonny, had a son one year younger than me,  who was  named George , after my grandfather . I always played games with cousin George in grandma Jinx’s garden.  The two of us got along we ll.      On New Year’s Eve our neighbors once set up a bonfire party in the field next to our house. I was fascinated by how big the fire was. I had never seen anything like it, and it astounded my little mind. This was also the first time I saw fireworks.  My father gave me one of those sparklers to play with, which I was enraptured by.        There was one very special place that my father would often take me to. It was at the top of a range of beautiful rolling hills that I termed the “London Hills”, because I thought that London was on the other side of them. We would go there to fly kites. I can remember these experiences vividly. The hills were full of tall straw -like grass, and the weather was always windy – perfect for kite flying.       It was a time  of utmost happiness and joy for me. My father taught me to fly a kite by myself. The wind was so strong that I feared it would lift up my frail little body and carry me into the clouds. Once I got the hang of it , it was exhilarating. We would fly our kite s together and run with the wind. I will never forget that place.        My favorite childhood film was The Land Before Time. I used to watch that movie all the time with Ah Mah. It was about a  baby dinosaur named Littlefoot who had just lost his mother and  was journeying through a dangerous world to find the “Great Valley”, a land of prosperity an d peace. I remember the feeling of utter sadness I felt during the scene when his mother died, and the triumphant and happy emotions that swept over me ",1
"28","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","when he fin ally discovered the Great Valley, after going through all the hardship  to get there . I watched this movie so many times that just thinking about it brings the emotions back. It was a big part of my childhood.        Already a world traveler, I went on a tri p to Spain with my parents and my parent’s friend s Patrick and Lupe. It was the fourth  country I’ve been to at such a young age. We stayed in an exquisite castle -like house that I believe was owned by a friend of ours. The house had a  tower that I was extremely curious about. At one point, my parents and their friends ventured up to the top of it, but they made me stay below because I was too young. I was sorely disappointed. As they were climbing the tower I went outside to look at the cacti surrounding the house. These cacti also sparked my curiosity, and I foolishly decided to touch a cactus. I ended up getting cactus needles all over my hand, and it took a long time for my mother to remove them.       Shortly after my trip to Spain, we went on another tri p to Greece. We stayed at a hotel near the beach. It was very hot there. The weather was new to me, as I was used to the cold British climate.       The trip to Greece was significant because during this time, my father received the news of the death of my grandfather George  Rodger . He died of natural causes on my  4th birthday , at the age of 87.  It was the first experience I had of the death of a close relative, and the first time I saw my father cry. My 4 year old self could not imagine my father ever crying, and so when I saw him cry that day, I knew how shaken he was. It was a very sad day for all of us.  We immediately flew home.        I believe that it was during the time after my 4th birthday that my father came to the decision to eventually move to the  United States. As he was just  becoming a director, he believed Los Angeles would offer more opportunities. We took a short trip to California to gain an initial look at it.  I don’t remember much of this trip, but I do remember having a good time. At the age of 4, I, Elliot Rodger, had already been to six different countries. Who can claim that, eh? The United Kingdom, France, Spain, Greece, Malaysia, and the United States.  [3]     It was also during this time that my mother became pregnant  again . I was going to have a sibling. My parents decided to have another baby, this pregnancy being planned, so that I can have a sibling to grow up with. We later discovered it was going to be a girl.       Before my 5th birthday, my mother went into labor to deliver the baby. I can remember the night vividly. I was very ill that night, a bad omen. I stayed at home with Ah Mah while my mother and father were at the hospital, and we watched movies together. I was fraught with anticipation the whole time. And then my parents came back late in the night, and with them they brought a little black -haired baby wrapped in a bundle. I had a baby sister, and they named her Georgia.             I have no memories of what happened on my 5th birthday. Shortly after it, we were making plan s to permanently move to the United States. The news excited me, but I was sad at the prospect of leaving my life in England behind. My father took a short trip to the U.S. by himself to scout out houses. I remember talking on the phone to him while he was  there. He told me he found a very nice house for us to move to. I asked him if it had a swimming pool, and he said it did. This news made me very happy.       And then the time came. We started packing everything up at the Old Rectory. On my last day at Dorsett House school, my teacher was giving all of us candies when my mother came to pick me up early. I said goodbye to all the friends I had there. That was the last time I saw them.       My father was given the offer to buy the  Old Rectory for about 400,0 00 Pounds (we were only renting it at the time), but he declined, a decision he would regret later on, as it would have been a worthy investment.       I cried as we drove away from the Old Rectory. All the experiences I had there; playing in the fields, driving my toy tractor, tending to my garden, going on walks wit h Ah Mah, swinging on the swing;  all those experiences were gone. I was about to start a new life. We boarded the plane and took off to America.   Part 2  Growing up in America  Age 5 -9       The p lane ride was like a dimension between worlds. I was about to enter a whole new world. A whole new life. But none of that went through my little 5 year old head at the time. I slept for most of the journey there, and I can remember looking out the window a t the vast stretch of clouds below us. I wondered what it would be like to go down there and run along them as if they were a landmass, not thinking about the fact that I would fall right through!       When we arrived in America, I was very tired. We collected our luggage and loaded them onto a new SUV that my father rented. The image of us driving out of the airport is still fresh in my mind. I often think of it as my first step into my new life in the U.S.       I w as so sleepy when we reached our  new house that I didn’t even bother to look around yet. The house was partly furnished, and we already had a sofa and a television. T he first thing we did was watch a movie. The movie was Independence Day, and I fell asleep at some parts, but managed to watch most of the movie.       In the morning  I was full of energy. I eagerly clamored up the stairs to search for my new room. I looked at all the rooms before singling out the one that I wanted as mine. When I told my mother about my decision, she told me that the room I picked was meant to be my sister Georgia’s room. I got a bit upset, but eventually settled for the room next to it.       The house was quite big, with white walls and a beautiful backyard that led to a gated swimming pool area. It was located in an upscale part of Woodland Hills. The town of Woodland Hills has great [4]significance in my life. It would be the town that I grow up in. A large portion of all my life experiences, good and bad, would take place in this town. I can recall the first time I said the name on my lips… Woodland Hills… my new hometown.        Soon after settling into  our lovely new home, we were disturbed by a problem typical of California: An earthquake. My mother woke me up in the middle of the night, and we all hid under the kitchen table. The earthquake actually turned out to be very small, with even smaller aftershocks following it, but I was still scared. Having never experienced an earthquake before, the only impression I had of earthquakes were the huge, land rupturing earthquakes I saw in The Land Before Time. After this experience, I began to see earthquakes as common, minor disturbances.       And there I was, a young 5 year old boy who has so far lived a happy and joyful life about to embark on a new journey; the journey of growing up in the United States of America. I felt a surge of enthusiasm at the prospect. I now considered myself an “American kid”, as I told my parents. I got accustomed to all the American T.V. shows, and I started to adopt an American accent.  I was looking forward to my new life.      Soon enough, I was enrolled in school. My father did some extensive school -searching after our arrival, and he found a small private school on Shoup Avenue named Pinecrest. I was to attend kindergarten there. Pinecrest… My 5 -year- old self at the time could not imagine how significant this place will eventually become for me. A great turning point of my life will eventually take place there, a tragic turn for the worse. But that will come later, in a darker chapter  of my story, when I enter my pre -teen years. For now, I was a kindergartener who was enjoying life to the fullest.       Kindergarten at Pinecrest didn’t turn out so well. I had a very unpleasant teacher who was impatient with how far behind I was in my schoolwork, as I had missed a couple months of school due to the move. During playtime, this teacher would keep me in the classroom to do extra work in order to catch up. My parents didn’t like this teacher, and one of their friends recommended another school for me, a private school nearby named Farm School ; it was named after the farm that was attached to it . After only a couple of weeks at Pinecrest, my parents took me out of it, and I would not return again until I go there for Middle School six years later.      My first day at farm school turned out to be a good start. I had two teachers, and they made an effort to introduce me to the other kids. There was one particular boy named Joey who they assigned to show me around. He was nice to me at first, but would soon turn out to be a rotten little prick who I would always get into fights with.  He then became  my greatest enemy at the school.             The first real friend I made in the United States was a girl named Maddy  Humphreys . Isn’t that ironic? The first friend I made in the United States was a girl! She was the first ",1
"29","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","female friend I’ve ever had, and she would be the last. Maddy and I started playing together at Farm School , and eventually my parents became very good friends with her parents. Maddy’s father is the famous British musician Paul Humpreys, and her mother is named Maureen, though we would call her Mo. They had a nice house in Hidden Hills. Our families got together often to have barbeques and dinners.       I was a  5 year old boy playing wit h a girl my own age like any normal boy would do. I was enjoying life in a world that I loved. I was happy, and completely oblivious of the fact that my future  on this world would only turn to darkness and misery because of girls. This girl who was my friend, Maddy Humpreys, would eventually come to represent everything I hate and despise; everything that is against me, and everything that I’m against. I was playing innocently with this girl, in the manner that all children pl ay. We even took baths together ; it was the only time in my life that I would see a girl my age naked. When I think about the experiences I had during my friendship with her, it  makes me think ominously of the fact that all children , boys and girls, start out the same. We all start out innocent, and we all start out [5]together. Only through the experiences and circumstances of growing up do we drift apart, form allegiances, and face each other as enemies. That is when wars happen, and that is when the true nature of humanity rises to the surface. At this stage of  my life, of course, my war hadn’t started yet, and it wouldn’t start for a long time. I was enjoying my life without a care in the world, not knowing that all of my joy is destined to turn to dust.        My Kindergarten year at Farm School was filled with exciting, new experiences , all healthy for a growing boy. I had friends, I had playdates, I socialized with the other boys at school, despite getting into lots of conflicts with Joey. I only got into trouble once, over a quarrel with another boy during playtime, and I was sent to the principal’s office. Having never been in such trouble at school before, I recall being overcome with nervousness and fear, which caused me to cry  for an hour. I especially enjoyed our arts and crafts time, and I loved it when our class would go on visits to the school’s farm.       After a bright and joyous school year, it was time to graduate. I was swelled with pride as I wore my graduation cap at the ceremony. I loved that school very much, and I was sad to leave it. Kindergarten was over, and soon enough I would enter elementary school.       My 6th birthday soon followed. My parents arranged a Disney -themed party at  a play center that my mother had  been taking me to frequently. I invited everyone from my Farm School class,  all the boys and the girls,  except for Joey. I deliberately omitted Joey as an act of revenge for being mean to me throughout the year, and I felt a sense of satisfaction in doing so.       The party was cheerful,  and there was a man dressed as Merlin to host the festivities. I sat at the end of the table during my birthday meal, wearing a wizard hat. As my cake was presented to me, I felt only elation and glee as I took in a breath and blew out my candles. Life was good.   6 Years Old        My favorite part of the day  during this jubilant period of my life was our afternoon trips to the park. Specifically, Serrania Park.  This park was beautiful and green, with concrete pathways cutting through fields of grass and a fun playground for us kids to play in. I always took to playing on the slides, and sometimes I would go on the swing, though my father had to push me. I remember getting jealous of other boys who were able to swing by themselves, boys who were even younger than myself. It was the second time I realized my lack of physical capability. The first time I had such an inkling of my shortcomings were those disastrous football sessions at Dorsett House.       Eventually, my father got around to teaching me how to swing by myself, and after some practice, I was able to do it. After that, I would always soar up and down on that swing in the Serrania park playground well int o the hour of twilight.        I was very small and short statured for my age. I never gave this much concern during my early childhood, but this fact fully dawned on me the day my family took a trip to Universal Studios. At the time, I loved dinosaurs. I w as fascinated by them. I had just recently watched the movie Jurassic Park, and when I found out that there was a Jurassic Park themed ride at Universal Studios, I couldn’t wait to go on it. We queued  up in the line a nd waited for an hour. When  reached the  front, the park staff presented me with a measuring stick, and I didn’t fit the requirements . I saw other boys my age admitted onto the ride, but I was denied because I was too short! The ride that I was so excited to enjoy at the theme park was forbidden  to me . I immediately fell into a crying tantrum, and my mother had to comfort me.       Being denied entry on a simple amusement park ride due to my height may seem like only a small injustice, but it was big for me at time. Little did I know, this injustice was very small indeed compared to all the things I’ll be denied in the future because of my height.  [6]     We resorted to trying out the E.T. ride, which I was admitted to. I had a miserable time on this ride, however, because the dark atmosphere and the  mechanically moving alien statues that lined the queuing area scared the hell out of me. By the time we got to the actual ride, I was crying in fright, but later calmed down as the ride turned out to be mild and relaxing towards the end.        I always enjoyed my family’s get -togethers with the Humphreys. These get -togethers became a common occurrence in my life. Maddy became a very close friend of mine. She was the only friend from Farm School who I continued to see after I graduated. They  had a huge back yard area, and the two of us would go on adventures. She also grew up watching The Land Before Time, and we would watch the sequels together whenever they released a new one.      Sometimes when I went to her house, she would have other female friends there, and I played with them too. I had no trouble interacting with girls at that age, surprisingly. My six -year- old self was playing with girls, unbeknownst to the horror and misery  the female gender  would inflict upon me later in my life. In the present day , these girls would treat me like the scum of the earth;  but at that time, we were all equals.  Such bitter irony.        It was now time for me to start First Grade . My parents enrolled me at Serrania  Avenue Elementary School, which was just down the street from Serrania Park. I wouldn’t remain at this school for long, however, because only weeks into my First Grade year, my parents decided that they were going to move to Topanga.       Most of the kid s at Serrania Avenue school will end up going to Taft High School nearby, a place that will cause me great suffering in the future. Perhaps some of the kids in my class at Serrania will end up turning into those who would bully me at Taft. I don’t remember  any of the kids from my class there, so I will never know the answer to that. It’s very disturbing  to think about.       I quite enjoyed my brief time at Serrania. My parents sometimes made me stay an hour after school; I believe this was because they fig ured it would help me make friends. I can remember this after -school playtime being a positive experience. There were always games that I played with the other kids. And thus I was a bit frustrated when my parents told me they were going to transfer me to another school after only a couple of weeks of settling into Serrania. That frustration would soon cease, because the years that I would spend at Topanga Elementary school would be some of the best years of my life. The last years of being a carefree child .       I started First Grade at Topanga Elementary School a couple of weeks before we prepared to move to Topanga. Topanga is a secluded, mountainous community surrounding a canyon that runs through the Santa Monica Mountains, located in between the San F ernando Valley and the Pacific Coast Highway. We had only passed through this community a few times, when we would take trips to the beach. It has a certain rugged beauty about it.       On my first day at Topanga Elementary, I was very nervous. Since it w as about a month after the first grade term started, I was going to be the “new kid” at school. I remember the nervousness taking over my body as my mother drove us up the steep road that led into the school proper. My new class was just lining up to start  the day as we walked onto the main courtyard. My teacher, Mrs. Matsuyama, was very nice and understanding. My mother said goodbye and I got in line with the other students. The first kid I saw there was a chubby boy named Bryce Jacobs, who was staring at me strangely.       As we got to class, ",1
"30","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","Mrs. Matsuyama assigned one of the students to show me around and help me adjust. This student happened to be  none other than Philip Bloeser. Philip was always very mature for his age, and he was nice to me on my firs t day. He became my first friend at Topanga Elementary.       The day turned out to be one of great fun. Class time was not too boring, and we did some fun arts and crafts activities. For recess and lunch, there were two playgrounds: the Upper and the Lowe r. The [7]first and second graders would go to the Lower playground, and the third, fourth, and fifth graders would go to the Upper. The Lower playground was smaller, but it had some nice amenities, especially the sloping hill to the side  of it, where I would  enjoy running up and down “kicking dust”, a game I instantly created due to the dust -like dirt on this hill. When my mother came to pick me up, I recall having so much fun that I didn’t want to leave! That’s a first. In the past, I was always eager to go home after spending hours at school.       The drive to and from school was a long one, or at least long for my six -year -old self. My favorite part of the drive was the descent from Topanga into the Valley. The view of the broad expanse of the Valley was br eathtaking as it opened up before us after clearing the final hill. I would make that trip through the winding roads of Topanga Canyon every day for the next couple of weeks, before we move d to the new house. Sometimes my mother would pick me up, and somet imes my nanny would. I don’t remember the name of this nanny, as she was only with us for a brief period of time.        I loved the new house the moment I laid eyes on it. It was a beautiful, round, wooden house located up the road from Valley View Drive, in the better part of Topanga. It had two stories, a swimming pool, and a lovely deck that provided a view of the lush mountains.  I instantly named it the “Round House”.       I was sad to leave our house in Woodland Hills, our first house in America. I wou ld miss the good times I had there, playing with Maddy and my other friends, swimming in the pool, the close proximity to Serrania Park where I spent a lot of time enjoying the elations of a carefree childhood. Our new Round House in Topanga, however, turn ed out to be a worthy replacement.       My room at the Round House was a bit smaller than my old one, but I remember it being very cozy. Shortly after we moved in, Ah -Mah came to visit from England, and she baked my favorite peanut cookies. We had some ver y happy times during the beginnings of my life there.       My father’s new directing career was taking off quite well too, and he would go away a lot to direct commercials for prestigious companies, leaving my mother and the nanny to look after me. The on ly downside of this was my father’s absence from my life. Despite this, I always looked up to him as a powerful and successful man.        Adjusting to my new environment in Topanga was quite easy for me, especially since school was so much fun. I was now a Topanga Kid. During recess at school, I started noticing this  boy with slightly long blonde hair who also enjoyed kicking dust. Befo re I met him, I always mentally nicknamed him the “King Arthur Kid”, due the regal look his hairstyle gave him. It was only a matter of time before our dusting kicking antics would collide with each other. We then teamed up and starting playing the game together, and this was the start of a long and interesting friendship. This boy’s name was James Ellis, and he would become my best friend for the next 14 years of my life.       Sometimes, the two of us would join with Philip Bloeser and some other boys, an d play fun games like handball, war games, and tag.       Soon enough, I would start having frequent playdates with James Ellis. His house was just down the hill from mine. James’s father was named Art e; and his mother, Kim, became one of my mother’s best friends.        Christmas arrived quickly, and for my present I got my first video game console, a Nintendo 64! I had little knowledge of video games before this. I barely knew what they were. My father is the one who introduced me to them. With the Nintendo  64, my father bought the games Star Wars: Shadows of the Empire, and Turok : Dinosaur Hunter . I was fascinated with this new form of entertainment, and my father and I would bond a lot over our video game sessions.       Of course, while playing these video  games, my innocent, happy self knew nothing of the significant role video games w ould  play during a large portion of my life…  and the sanctuary such games w ould  [8]eventually provide for me from the cruelties of this world. For now, they were just a form of entertainment like any other hobby.        Life was good at the round house, but soon enough I had to witness my mother and father get into a lot of arguments. I was too young at the time to understand what they were arguing about, but I knew they were not getting along. It didn’t really concern me all too much, because every other aspect of my life was wonderful.       I had playdates with James Ellis every week. Sometimes he would surprise me with a visit after school, as we lived so close by. I went over to Philip Bloeser’s house a few times as well, and I met his younger brother, Jeffrey. The Bloeser’s also became good friends with my mother. They live d in a nice house up the road from ou r own, with a deck that provided  an extraordinary view of the Topang a mountains.             At some point I learned about the possibility that parents can separate… divorce… no longer live together. The prospect baffled my little mind. I once sat down with my mother on our outside deck and asked her if she and father woul d ever divorce. She told me it w ill never happen, and that I had  nothing to worry about. I was relieved by that. Little did I know, such a thing would happen in only a few months time.        My first grade year ended splendidly. I made a few lasting friends, and I had a blast at Topanga Elementary. I always considered myself a good, well -behaved student, so I was a bit disappointed at the few times I got in trouble. My class had a system where if we do something wrong, we would change our card color from green to yellow, and then to red if we did any more troublemaking . I thought I would never have to change my card, but I had to change it to yellow a few times for minor things. When first  grade ended, I made the resolution that in second grade I will never be forced to change my card.       After my last day of school, I was looking forward to a  long summer break, my favorite time of the year. I was a bit dismayed when my parents made me at tend summer camp. My father had to go away a lot for work, and my mother needed to  have some time to look after baby Georgia. Summer camp wasn’t all that bad, I had some fun. It consisted of kids from First through Fourth g rade, and we played lots of games  and watched movies.   7 Years Old        My last memory of my  parents being together was my 7th birthday, and I would always cherish it.  We didn’t have a party for my seventh birthday, but more of a small get -together for lunch.  Maddy and the Humpreys were our only guests. We celebrated  it at Glads tones, my favorite restaurant at  the time. It was in the Pacific Palisades, right on the beach. I had my favorite meal, lobster.       It was a very happy day for all of us. I was turning seven. That was a big numb er for my little mind. I had spent seven years on this fascinating world, and my life was at a good start. I had loving parents, I had friends to play with, I was having fun at school, and I had all the toys a little boy could want. A stranger would look a t this seven year old boy and think that he has a great life in front of him, that there is nothing to worry about. Indeed, there shouldn’t be anything to worry about… But I was just a child. I still had a few more years to enjoy life in carefree bliss bef ore I would eventually discover how twisted and cruel this “fascinating world ” really is.       My parents seemed happy that day. I remember them laughing and having a good time . It would be the last time I remember them being happy together. Perhaps they r eally weren’t, perhaps they were [9]just putting up a front so that I could  enjoy my birthday. I couldn’t even fathom the possibility of my parents separating.        Very shortly after my seventh birthday, the news came. I believe it was my mother who told me  that she and m y father were getting a divorce; m y mother, who only a few months before told me that such a thing w ill never happen. I was absolutely shocked, outraged, and above all, overwhelmed. This was a huge life -changing event.       My father was to  stay at the round house, and my mother would move to another smaller house in Topanga. It was arranged that me and my sister w ill mostly be living with our mother, and we would go to father’s house on the weekends. ",1
"31","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","My father was required to pay child supp ort to my mother so that she can look after us.       My life would change forever after this. The family I grew up with  has split in half, and from then on I would grow up in two different households. I remember crying. All the happy times I spent with my  mother and father as a family were gone, only to remain in memory. It was a very sad day. Just like the move to the U.S., it would be like starting a whole new life with a new routine.        Despite the initial sadness I felt from my family splitting in half, my new life situation wasn’ t all that bad. It was still practically the same life, though I lived with my mother in one house and my father in another.       My mother’s new house was small and red in color, located up a steep driveway from Topanga Canyon Boulevard . I would call it the “Red House”. It was the smallest house I’ve lived in at that point. It only had two bedrooms, and I had to share a room with my sister Georgia. We had a bunk -bed, and I slept on the top. I was quite uncomfortable with this change at first, being used to having my own room and living in bigger houses. My mother’s kind and loving nature, however, made up for this, and she turned the h ousehold into a fun environment which I enjoyed living in.       After spending the first week at mother’s house, father came to pick me and my sister up for the weekend. Georgia had become very attached to mother after this week, and she burst into tears when we drove off. I too, was a bit distressed at having to go from one house to the other  every week, but I would soon get used to it.       The Round House was very different without mother being there. When we entered, I felt a wave of sadness creep over me as I was reminded of my life when mother and father were together. The house was full  of memories; happy, cheerful memories that were lost in the past. With my mother missing from it, there was a sense of bleakness and loss to the place. Father did his best to cheer us up. I could tell that he, too, was very saddened by the recent events .      My father soon rented one of the rooms of the round house to his good friend Dan Perelli, one of his first friends in America . Dan  used to live close to our house in Woodland Hills until he was struck with financial troubles, which I’m assuming is why  he started renting a room from my father. I would always call him “Uncle Dan”. From this point on, Uncle Dan would stay with us as a lodger for a few years.        The time to start Second Grade arrived . My new teacher was named Mrs. Weisberg, and she was very kind. The students in my class were mostly the same as my  First Grade class, with only one or two new students who transferred from other schools. I made a few new friends, such as Shane  and Tommy.       I was very disappointed to find out that James E llis would not be returning to Topanga Elementary for second grade. In fact, his family would be moving out of Topanga to the Pacific Palisades, whe re they would be renting a house from their friends, the Lemelson’s.        My father’s stay at the round ho use was very brief. He suffered some temporary financial setbacks on top of  the divorce, so he decided to move to a smaller house on Old Topanga Canyon. It was a very [10]abrupt move, and I would never see the round house again. One day, after he picked me and  my sister up from mother’s, he took us to the new house and that was it.       The house was a small, two -story house in a more rustic part of the Topanga mountains. The upstairs portion had only a bedroom and bathroom, and it was rented to Uncle Dan. All  around the outside of the house were very small hills and hiking trails that led up to the mountains. Overlooking these hills was a massive, imposing  rock called “Big Rock”. When I first saw Big Rock, I told myself that one day I’ll climb to the top of it !      I took a liking to this new environment, and every time I visited father on the weekends, I would always be outside, exploring and adventuring. There were always new places to discover in that secluded region. I didn’t venture too far into the wilde rness, however, because of the danger of coyotes and mountain lions.             After only a couple of months since my seventh birthday, a new and very important person would come into my life. After father picked us up from school one day and took us to his house, I saw a woman with dark hair and fair skin standing in the kitchen, and she introduced herself as Soumaya. She would become my stepmother. Father told me she would be living with us fr om now on. At first I thought she was just another friend who was temporarily staying with father, similar to what Uncle Dan was doing. My father having a girlfriend so shortly after divorcing my mother didn’t even occur to me. I couldn’t understand it. So on enough, though, I realized that Soumaya was, in fact, his “girlfriend”, and they were together just like how my father and mother were together. It was the first time I learned the concept of a “girlfriend”, and it was hard to grasp. Before that, I alwa ys thought a man and a woman had to be married before living together in such a manner, and that it would take a long time for such a union to happen. Father finding a new girlfriend in such a short amount of time baffled me. I was completely taken aback.       Because of my father’s acquisition of a new girlfriend, my little mind got the impression that my father was a man that women found attractive, as he was able to find a new girlfriend in such a short period of time from divorcing my mother. I subconsc iously held him in higher regard because of this. It is very interesting how this phenomenon works… that males who can easily find female mates garner more  respect from their fellow men, even children. How ironic is it that my father, one of those men who could easily find a girlfriend, has a son who would struggle all his life to find a girlfriend.       I soon became accustomed to Soumaya being part of father’s household. She hails from the Akaaboune  family, a very prominent family from the country of Morocco. For the initial period of her being a new member of the family, we got along well, and she was quite fun. But soon she would start to discipline me in a harsh way that I wasn’t used to. I felt t hat because she wasn’t my real parent, she had no right to discipline me in such a way, and so I rebelled. That’s where the first conflicts arose. There would  be many more to come in later years.        Along with the addition of Soumaya, I had two new nann ies. The first nanny was a French woman named Celine, though she was only with us for a brief period, so I don’t remember much of her. My second nanny was a German woman named Christine. Christine would stay with us for a year, and I became very fond of he r. She would always look after me during my time at father’s house, and whenever I went on my adventures into the hills, she always accompanied me.        Halloween this year marked my first time going Trick -or-Treating. My mother took me to my friend Shane ’s house, and we walked around his neighborhood collecting candy. Still obsessed with dinosaurs, I dressed up as a dinosaur for that Halloween. Trick -or-Treating was a new thing for me, as it wasn’t so popular in England. When it was all over, I was amazed  that I had so much candy.   [11]     Even though James Ellis no longer went to Topanga Elementary, he was still my best friend, and I saw him a lot. Mother would take us to his house in the Palisades almost every week, where I would play with James, and Georg ia would play with James’s sister Sage. He got me interested in a new phenomenon that gripped many children of the era: Pokemon.       When I got my first Gameboy console, I started playing Pokemon Red Version, and I was hooked instantly. I then started co llecting Pokem on cards, and James and I always compare d and trade d them.  The Pokemon anime cartoon became my favorite show on television. It was a very fun , captivating  hobby, and ev ery boy  at my school had a folder of Pokemon cards. It provided something to have, something to show off, something to talk about. The best cards were the “shinies”, and everyone coveted them.        Mother was still friends with George Lucas, so we got invites to the red carpet premiere of Star Wars Episode 1. I always was and always will be a huge Star Wars fan. I had already seen the original trilogy many times, and I considered myself very lucky to be able to go to the premiere of the new Star Wars movie.       It was an absolutely astonishing experience. It was just me and m y mother – Georgia was too young, so she stayed at home with a babysitter. Episode 1 is infamous  for being the lesser movie of the three new prequels, but as a kid I enjoyed it very much. Afterwards, I met some of the actors,  and I shook the hand of Jake L loyd, the actor who played Anakin ",1
"32","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","Skywalker in the movie.        My Second Grade year flew by like a breeze. I don’t remember much of it, but I did have a blast. During recess and lunch, I played a lot with Shane and Tommy. We would play Pokemon  on our Gameboys, and sometimes we would have playdates where we play ed Nintendo  64 games such as Banjo Kazooie, Super Mario 64, and Donkey Kong 64.       I failed in my goal of never having to change my card, which really disappointed me. I went through most of the year without changing my card, but right when the year was about to end, I was caught talking in class with a friend named Danny Dayani, who sat next to me, and I had to change my card to yellow. I blamed Danny for it, because  he was always talki ng in class, but I still had to change my card.       After a fast and fantastic year, summer came quickly, and with it my 8th birthday.  My 8th birthday was mellow, but pleasant . I remember my mother inviting a few of my friends from my second grade class and we had a cake. During my weekend at father’s house, we all went to the restaurant Typhoon  in Santa Monica  to celebrate it. It was quite a fancy restaurant next to a small airport, and they had a lot of exotic dishes that I tried.   8 Years Old        As I  was now eight -years -old, father decided that I was old enough to climb Big Rock. Whenever I was at father’s house, I would always see Big Rock looming in the distance, and I was just itching to climb it. I had already conquered every other rock in the are a… there was only Big Rock left. And so I set out with father and a few of father’s friends to finally climb to the top. The furthest I had climbed on this rock was about half way up with Christine. There was a very steep rise which I wasn’t able to ascend  without some help. The second half of the journey was quite a challenge, but it was so exhilarating! I was very nervous the higher we climbed . The best part, of course, was reaching the top, and the sense of accomplishment I felt. I finally did it! Lookin g down, I could see the vastness of the Old Topanga Canyon region, and father’s house looked tiny  down there . I was too scared to venture close to the edge, and I felt a sense of dread at the prospect of falling from such a height. The way down was even mo re challenging, but I felt so proud of myself for climbing that rock that it wasn’t as scary as I thought it would be.  [12]      I was very excited to start Third Grade. As Third Graders, we now got to play in the Upper Playground of Topanga Elementary, and I considered myself one of the “big kids”. The Upper was vast, with a bigger playground, more handball courts, and four basketball courts. My classroom was located in a bungalow adjacent to the Upper, and my teacher was named Mrs. Buntin. She was a young tea cher; I believe she was in her late 20’s. Being used to having very old teachers, I was surprised at how young my new teacher appeared.       I continued to play with the same friends during recess and lunch, where we would spend our time comparing and trad ing Pokemon cards. In the midst of elementary school, I didn’t interact with girls much, but this was normal. I was at that period of life where the boys played with the boys and the girls played with the girls, completely separate from each other. Girls w ere the last thing on my mind. Maddy was still the only friend I had who was a girl, and I only saw her on the occasions whe n our families would have a get -together, which became more and more rare after Maddy’s parents divorced and Paul Humpreys  moved back to England.       It was as if the girls in elementary school were part of a separate reality. Despite not having much interaction with them, they treated me cordially, as they treated all other boys of my age. This was fair, and I was content w ith this. I hadn’t gone through puberty yet, and so I had no desire for female validation. My eight -year -old self had no inkling of the pain and misery girls would cause me once puberty would inevitably arrive  and my sexual desires for girls would develop.  Sexual desires that would be mercilessly spurned.  Some of the boys in my class would grow up to be embraced by girls, while I would  grow up to  be rejected by them. But at that moment in time, we were just innocent children growing up together. All innocen ce is destined to be shattered and replaced with bitter brutality.      I was living in ignorant , innocent bliss. And I was happy with it.        This period of my life, aside from my early childhood in England, was one of the best periods. Life was fair an d life was satisfying.  As kids, proving our self -worth and gaining validation among our peers was achieved in a fair manner, by how good we were at the games we played, or how big our collection of Pokemon cards were. No one had unfair advantages. This was  perfect, and this is how life should be.       And… boy did I have a lot of fun. James’s family had to move to yet another house in the Palisades, and mother would always take us there. She became great friends with James’s parents Kim and Art e. James and  I would battle on our Gameboys, trade Pokemon cards, and walk to the recreation center down the street to play in the pool, and then for dinner we would all go to the restaurant Mott’ s in the center of the Palisades.       I was quite proud of my collectio n of Pokemon cards. I had gained a few “shinies” over the last few months, and I enjoyed showing them off to other boys. Shiny cards came randomly in card packets our parents would buy for us. The card that I coveted the most was the Charizard card, and on e morning when my mother opened a packet for me and I looked through the new cards… there it was. It felt like the best day ever, and I was swelled with excitement. I jumped up and down all around the Red House, and I couldn’t wait to show it to James, who  already had a Charizard himself.       Through being friends with James Ellis and going to his house a lot, we became acquainted with the Lemelson family, who were  family friends of Kim and Art e. The Lemelson family is a very wealthy family who has been  financially  helping James’s family for a while. Rob Lemelson is the son of Jerome Lemelson, the inventor of the bar code, and his net worth is in the hundred -millions. Rob’s son, Noah, is our age and great friends with James, and eventually  I became frien ds with him too, though we would never be close friends. Sometimes we would all go to the Lemelson’s house, also in the Palisades, and the three of us played together.   [13]     For Halloween, we went to the Lemelson’ s for Trick -or-Treating, and from then on i t would become tradition to go Trick -or-Treating with them. I dressed up like a dinosaur again, because I couldn’t think of anything else to be.  I wanted to dress up as Ash Ketchum from Pokemon, but no store had that costume  in stock . The Palisades was full of wealthy families, so the candy they gave  us would be in much larger amounts, obviously. I remember competing with James and Noah as to who would get the most candy at the end. Afterwards, we would have dinner at Rob’s house, and then we would d ump our candy in piles on the floor to examine what we got. That was my favorite part of it.        Early in my Third Grade year, my mother would often take us to a festival near Topanga Canyon Boulevard, where small concerts were  held and people barbeque d great food. A friend of hers had something to do with these events, and I played with the son of this friend. He was named Riley Anapol, and he was two years younger than me. A First Grader. I played with some other younger kids there as well, peers of Ril ey, and I had a good time. Riley became a common friend for a while. The significance of this is that Riley Anapol would eventually become someone I would harbor a great hatred for. Riley would grow up to get lots of girls, and I would grow up to be reject ed by girls. But back then he was a friend, a peer, and we were playing together as equals. It’s funny how the world works.        When the holidays arrived, my father announced that we were going to take a family vacation to Soumaya’s home country of Moroc co and meet her family there, and afterwards we w ere to  stop by in England. I wa sn’t excited about Morocco, since I didn’t know much about it except that it was in north Africa , and I wasn’t too excited about the fact that we’ll be staying there for six we eks either, which meant that my entire winter break would be spent  in a foreign country that I kne w nothing about.       But of course, I had no choice in the matter, and Morocco was added to the list of the many countries I’ve been to at such a young age.  I looked forward to visiting England afterwards and seeing family there.       Morocco was very strange and foreign to me, even more so than Malaysia, which was more westernized. I found it to be very backwards, though it had a lot of culture and the peop le were friendly. I remember ",1
"33","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","disliking a lot of the meals, but enjoying the deserts and pastries. Soumaya’s parents were divorced, though they lived walking distance  from each other in the Kasbah, a historic community located in the center of Tangier. Soum aya’s mother, Khadija, has a small but elegant house, and her father, Abdes alem, has a very large, almost castle -like house that is famous for being a location where a scene from James Bond: The Living Daylights was shot. This fascinated me, as I was a hug e James Bond fan at the time. In the center of this house there was an open cou rtyard where I always played with a kid named Ayman, and his two younger brothers. They were adopted by Soumaya’s father a few years ago and live with him.      After a long stay in Morocco – too long in my opinion – we made our stop in England to  visit relatives. We stayed at g randma Jinx’s house, and I was able to play with my cousin George for a few days. On one of the days we stayed  in England, my mother’ s sister, Aunt  Min, and my grandma Ah Mah came to visit and brought me a lot of English c hocolates  which I relished .       All in all, it was a good trip and I was glad to be able to experience it, though the length of the trip cut into my school schedule,  and I missed a couple of weeks of school.        After the holiday season, my nanny Christine had to leave back to Germany, and this saddened me deeply. Chistine would always be my favorite nanny, and I was in a sullen mood on the day she left.        The r emainder of my Third Grade year went by quickly. I continued my Pokemon endeavors, increasing my card collection and progressing on the Gameboy game.       I had a conflict with my friend Shane during this time. Because of some arguments we previously had,  I started to play a game with him in which he would become my enemy and rival at the school. For me, I [14]was just playing with him, but he took it seriously and the conflict escalated a lot more than I thought it would. We once got into a small physical fig ht in which I hit him on the arm and was sent to the principal’s office. That was the biggest trouble I’ve been in at Topanga Elementary. This little conflict with Shane lasted for the rest of Third Grade, but we would later reconcile and play again as fri ends in Fourth Grade.        Before summer came, my father’s spontaneous career as a commercial Director took off once again, and he became very successful. At this point, he was probably the most successful he’s ever bee n. With this success, he decided  to move to a bigger and better house. After doing some searching, we moved to a house in an upscale area of West Hills, near Woodland Hills. I loved this house at first sight. It had five bedrooms, which was more than enough space for our family along with Un cle Dan who was still staying with us. It also had a huge swimming pool with a spa, a large grass field to play in, a basketball court, and a nice view of the Valley. I was a Valley kid again.       Despite father’s move to a much larger house and all the b enefits that came with it, I still preferred my time at mother’s  house , just because of her gentle and fun attitude  and the energy of her household. My mother indulged in me more than my father and Soumaya ever did. She knew what I liked and what I didn’t like, and she would go out of her way to make my life pleasant and enjoyable. I was quite annoyed with the recent decision between my mother and father to extend my stay at father’s by two days of the week. From that point  on, me and my sister would only b e at mother’s house from Monday to Thursday, and on Thursday night we would go to father’s house until the following Monday.        My 9th Birthday was spent at father’s house, and father and Soumaya threw a party for me. They invited a few of my friends f rom Topanga Elementary, though the only friend I remember being there was Philip and his younger brother Jeffrey. James was invited, but he wasn’t able to make it. They also invited a few of Georgia’s friends, which really annoyed me, since it was my  birth day, and not Georgia’s. It was quite an eventful party, and it took place in our backyard. My father hired a magician to perform tricks for everyone.   9 Years Old        My ninth year was very interesting, and I went through a lot of changes emotionally and  intellectually. It was the year in which I matured to a point where I would start observing the world more conscientiously. Before I turned nine, I was living life as a carefree child in a world that I thought was only good and pure. From this point onwar ds, I would gradually discover more about the world and society. I would face problems and frustrations that I wouldn’t even think about before. My life would still be positive and bright, however, and I would live it to its fullest.        The first frust ration of the year, which would remain for the rest of my life, was the fact that I was very short for my age. As Fourth Grade started, it fully dawned on me that I was the shortest kid in my class – even the girls were taller than me. In the past, I rarel y gave a thought to it, but at this stage I became extremely annoyed at how everyone was taller than me, and how the tallest boys were automatically respected more. It instilled the first feelings of inferiority in me, and such feelings would only grow mor e volatile with time.       I desperately wanted to get taller, and I read that playing basketball increases height. This sparked my brief interest in basketball, and I would play it all the time during recess and lunch in the Upper. Most of the basketball courts were unused, so I would play it by myself, or with anyone who cared to join me. During my time at father’s, I would spend hours playing basketball at father’s  basketball court, shooting [15]hoop after hoop long into the evening, and I also remember lyin g on the ground in the basketball court trying to stretch my body as much as I could  in between basketball sessions.       When I played basketball at school, some boys would join me, and when they did I saw that they were much better at the sport than me. I envied their ability to throw the ball at double the distance than I could. This made me realize that along with being short, I was physically weak compared to other boys my age. Even boys younger than me were stronger. This vexed me to no end.        My fourth grade classroom was located in the center area of the school, and  my teacher was named Mrs. Gill, who had an assistant named Mr. Devine. Fourth grade was a strange year due to the emotional problems I would go through, and I didn’t have as m uch fun at school as I did in previous years. In class, I sat near Keaton Webber, and I got into a few conflicts with him. We weren’t quite enemies, but I disliked him intensely and I would always consider him a foul prick.        By nature, I am a very jealous person, and at the age of nine my jealous nature sprung to the surface. During playdates with James, sometimes he would have other friends over as well, and I would feel very jealous and upset when he paid more attention to them. Feeling left out, I would find a quiet corner and start crying. My mother and Kim were very understanding, and did the best they could to console me.       On the rare occurrence that my mother would have Maddy and Mo over for dinner, or if we would go to visit t hem at their h ouse, Maddy often play ed with my little sister Georgia instead of me, and this too made  me jealous. I remember all the times I cried when this happened.       Jealousy and envy… those are two feelings that would dominate my entire life and bring me immense  pain.  The feelings of jealousy I felt at nine -years- old were frustrating, but the y were nothing compared to how I would feel once I hit puberty and have to watch girls choosing other boys over me. Any problem I had at nine -years -old was nirvana compared to what I was doomed to face.        A few months into fourth grade, it was decided by my parents to change me and my sister’s living arrangement yet again. This time, we would be switching between mother’s house and father’s house each week. One week would  be spent at mother’s, and the next at father’s. This was a fair split. At first I wasn’t so sure about it, because I always disliked any change to my life, but I found it to be a better arrangement. This enabled me to spend weekends at mother’s house, dur ing her week, and I was very excited about this. I’ve only ever spent weekends at father’s beforehand.       During father’s week, I would mostly be looked after by our two new nannies, Rosa and Amparro. They were of South American origin and didn’t speak much English, but they were very kind.       I started to have intense conflicts with Soumaya. I hated the rules she imposed on me, which I believed she had no right to impose, as she wasn’t my true parent. I hated how she would force me to drink milk every  morning and very foul-tasting soup for dinner. I made such a ",1
"34","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","fuss about having the soup that she used it as a punishment. Whenever I did something wrong, she would force me to drink the soup. I once had a playdate with Philip at father’s house, and when I yelled at my sister b ecause she was annoying us, Soumaya punished me by sending me to my room for an hour, embarrassing me in front of Philip. After this incident, I never had a playdate at father’s house ever again.       This conflict with Soumaya started a trend in which I w ould love being at mother’s house and dread the weeks I had to spend at father’s house. On top of the conflicts with Soumaya, father was rarely there, as he was always out of town for his work. After spending a nice week at mother’s house, I would cry when  Sunday came and I had to go to father’s on Monday. I would then spend the entire week at father’s house looking forward to going back to my mother’s. I remember those Mondays when my mother dropped me off at school for the first day of father’s week… I fe lt so sad that I cried when I saw my mother’s car driving away. Of course, I would hide the tears to avoid embarrassment at school, but I would feel miserable for that whole day.  [16]      I always had a pleasant experience  during mother’s week. She always arr anged playdates for me, because she knew I was too shy to initiate them myself. She always made everything fun. On weekends after dinner, we would have “treat time”, where she would bring out a box of candies for me and my sister to choose from.       I ha d a lot of playdates with Philip, and through Philip I also played with his brother Jeffrey, who was two years younger than us. While Philip was calm and mature, Jeffrey was the complete opposite. Jeffrey Bloeser was wild and boisterous, which often brough t a lot of fun to my playdates with Philip.       My mother once had a party at her house and invited all of our family friends. James Ellis came over, and so did Philip and Jeffrey. It was the first time I saw all of them together, and it made for an interesting experience. I got a bit jealous, however, when Philip and Jeffrey seemed to respect and pay more attention to James than they did to me. When we were playing on my Nintendo 64 and I was competing against James, they rooted for James, which really u pset me.        As my fourth grade year approached its end, my little nine -year- old self had another revelation about how the world works. I realized that there were hierarchies, that some people were better than others. Of course I was subconsciously aware  of this in the past, but it was at this time of my life – at nine years old – that I started to give it a lot of thought and importance.       I started to see this at school. At school, there were always the “cool kids” who seemed to be more admirable tha n everyone else. The way they looked, dressed, and acted made them… cooler. These “cool kids” as I called them, included Keaton Webber, Matt Bordier, Michael Ray, Trevor Bourget, Zalman Katz, John Jo Glen, and a few  more. They were cool, they were popular,  and they always seemed like they were having a good time.       The peaceful and innocent environment of childhood where everyone had an equal footing was all over. The time of fair play was at its end. Life is a competition and a struggle, and I was slow ly starting to realize it.       When I became aware of this common social structure at my school, I also started to examine myself and compare myself to these “cool kids”. I realized, with some horror, that I wasn’t “cool” at all. I had a dorky hairstyle, I wore plain and uncool clothing, and I was shy and unpopular. I was always described as the shy boy in the past, but I never really thought my shyness would affect me in a negative way, until this point .       This revelation about the world, and about my self, really decreased my self -esteem. On top of this was the feeling that I was different because  I am of mixed race. I am half W hite, half Asian, and this made me different from the normal fully -white kids that I was trying to fit in with.        I envied  the cool kids, and I wanted to be one of them. I was a bit frustrated at my parents for not shaping me into one of these kids in the past. They never made an effort to dress me in stylish clothing or get me a good -looking haircut. I had to make every effo rt to rectify this. I had to adapt.       My first act was to ask my parents to allow me to bleach my hair blonde. I always envied and admired blonde -haired people, they always seemed so much more beautiful. My parents agreed to let me do it, and father to ok me to a hair salon on Mulholland Drive in Woodland Hills. Choosing that hair salon was a bad decision, for they only bleached the top of my head blonde. When I indignantly questioned why they didn’t make all of my hair blonde, they said that I was too y oung for a full bleaching. I was furious. I thought I looked so silly with blonde hair at the top of my head and black hair at the sides and back. I dreaded going to school the next day with this weird new hair.       When I arrived at school the next day, I was inte nsely nervous. Before class started, I stood in a corner franticly trying to figure out how I would go about revealing this to everyone. Trevor was the first one to notice it, and he came up to me and patted my head, saying that it was ve ry “cool ”. Well, that [17]was exactly what I wanted. My new hair turned out to be quite a spectacle, and for a few days I got a hint of the attention and admiration I so craved.        My interest in Pokemon faded away at this time. In third grade, Pokemon was consider ed “cool” and everyone was playing it. Towards the end of fourth grade, I found out that everyone was growing out of Pokemon, and the only ones who played it were the geeky kids. I heard some kids joking about how lame Pokemon players were, and I decided i t was time to quit.       I talked to James about this. He was still interested in Pokemon, so I gave him my Charizard card as a gift, and as an act of my resignation from the game. Pokemon gave me some really happy  and memorable  experiences, but it was tim e to move on.        I then started to notice that all of the cool kids were interested in skateboarding. I had never even ridden on a skateboard before, but if I wanted to be cool, I had to become a skateboarder. I expressed this to my parents, and my fath er was glad that I was showing an interest in an active sport. He took me to the store Val Surf on Ventura Boulevard to buy me a new skateboard, and I was fascinated by all of the different choices. I settled for a red Val Surf branded Skateboard, and they  took it down from the wall and built it for me.       I was thrilled to have this new skateboard and the possible chance it gave me to be a cool kid. It was time to start practicing. I found it very hard to even ride on it in the beginning, and I spent many hours outside trying to get the hang of it. And that  was that, I was now a skateboarder, though not yet good enough to reveal myself as one to the kids at school. This was the start of an obsession to copy everything the supposed “cool kids” were doing.   Part 3  The Last Period of Contentment  Age 9 -13       Fourth grade ended, and once the summer started, I took a vow to mold myself into the coolest kid I could possibly be by the time Fifth grade began. I anticipated the approval the other cool kids would have of me once I reveal myself as being similar to them, and I looked forward to it.        After about a year and a half of living in the house on Hatteras St. in upp er West Hills, my father decided  to move into an even better house. This time, all of us spent a day looking at open houses together as a family. We went with a real estate agent and examined some beautiful homes around Woodland Hil ls. M y favorite one was a 3 -story house  on Llano Drive,  in the Woodland Hills Heights, the most prestigious area of Woodland Hills  that bordered Calabasas . It did n’t have a pool, but it had a sloping backyard almost three -times as large as our current one. The house had six bedrooms, and I took an intense liking to one particular bedroom that had its own bathroom and a personal balcony. My father showed extreme ent husiasm about possibly buying this house, and I became obsessed with getting that particular bedroom as my own room. When I brought it up with father and Soumaya, they said that the room would most likely be Georgia’s because it was closer to the master be droom. They said that I would get a bedroom downstairs, one without my own bathroom or balcony. I was furious, and I threw a huge crying tantrum.       Soon enough, father went  ahead with the decision to buy this house. I made a big deal about the possibil ity of not getting that lovely bedroom I wanted, and I kept sulking to father and Soumaya about it. When they finally moved and the first week of father’s at this new house started, I was very anxious. But then, as we entered, father and Soumaya surprised me and revealed that they ",1
"35","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","decided to give me [18]the room I wanted. I was so happy! I danced and leaped with joy all over the house, and then I went to my new balcony and looked out at the beautiful view of Woodland Hills for an hour.       After the move to t his new house, father would  never  move again, and he still lives there to this very day. I would have many important experiences t here for the next decade, both good and terrible.        I needed a skateboard for mother’s house too, and so my mother took me  to Val Surf and bought me a gray Val Surf skateboard. I would use this skateboard much more than the red skateboard I had at father’s house, since I had all of my playdates during mother’s week, and mother would make more of an effort to indulge in my new  interest, eventually taking me to skateparks every weekend.        I became very excited about my new hobby, and I shared it with James Ellis and Philip Bloeser, my two main friends. I wanted to get them interested in skateboarding as well. It was tricky t o get James into it, but he soon got his own skateboard, and we would start skateboarding together around his neighborhood.        As I now considered myself a skateboarder, I wanted to dress in the clothes that all the cool skateboarders were wearing. My mother took me to Val Surf once again, this time to shop for new shirts. I picked out a few that had the logos of skateboard companies on them. Late r that day I put on one of my new shirts, and I was thrilled to start going around in it. I felt cool.        At father’s house, I was introduced to a new nanny who would be living with us. Rosa and Amparro left back to their home countries a few months before we moved house. This new nanny was an African American woman named Tracy. She had a very fun personality , and I always had a pleasan t time when she looked after us. She was able to drive, unlike my previous nannies, and so she would be the one who would always pick me up from school during father’s week from that point on.        Uncle Dan had a quarrel with my father, and he was forced to move out. I would never see him again after that. Tracy would, in a way, replace Uncle Dan as the lodger who would live at father’s house.        Early in the summer, father forced  me to atte nd summer camp at an elementary school nearby our new house. This school was Bay Laurel Elementary School in Calabasas. I hated the prospect, and I vehemently protested it. The last thing I wanted to do was spend my coveted summer at a school where I didn’ t know anyone.       I was starting to like going to father’s house a lot more after moving to our lovely new house with my exquisite new room, but this decision of father’s made me dislike  my weeks there again. At mother’s house, I had it my way more ofte n, and that’s how I wanted to live.       I hated having to go to camp during the summer, and I was miserable at the start, but a couple weeks into it I made friends with two brothers named Thomas and Tyler.        On mother’s week, I spent more and more tim e practicing skateboarding, and I had lots of playdates with James where we would skateboard together. We also had a lot of fun playing Nintendo 64 games, such as Donkey Kong  64, Banjo Kazooie, Banjo Tooie, James Bond  Goldeneye , and many more. He also got me interested in collecting Beanie Babies . At first I thought such a thing was very lame and girly, but we used them to fuel our imagination and have mock battles and wars with each  other. It was our secret hobby that we told no one about.        I was reli eved when summer camp ended, and once it was over my 10th birthday arrived. I had been on this world for a decade, and what a decade it was… full of discovery, fun, and happy adventures.  I can’t say the same for the following decade.  [19]     I didn’t have a party for my 10th birthday, and I believe I celebrated it during mother’s week. We went out with James and his family to a restaurant in the Palisades.   10 Years Old        I was eager to re -bleach my hair to a fully blonde color, after the disastrous failure of my previous attempt. This time, Soumaya took me to the right salon, and they gave me a short haircut and bleached all of my hair blonde. When I looked at myself in the mirrior, I felt an intense level of satisfaction.       I went to James’s house soon after I acquired my new hair color, and the look of surprise on his face when he firs t saw me gave me a good laugh.       A couple of weeks later, my hair started to  grow and my black hair would show at the roots, but the blend turned out to suit me well, and this would become my hairstyle for the next year.        Mother took me and my sister  on a short vacation towards the end of the summer. We drove up the 101 Freew ay to Ventura, where we stayed at the Holiday Inn (which has now been replaced by the Crowne Plaza). I found the hotel to be comfortable and luxurious. It wa s located right on the Ventura Promenade, a beautiful walkway along the beach that led to a long pi er.       At this stage, I was very enthusiastic about my new interest in skateboarding, and I took my skateboard with me. I enjoyed practicing on my new skateboard all along the Ventura Promenade. During this trip, m other took me to my first skate park, wh ich was called SkateStreet. It was humungous, and I was awed by all the towering ramps. I attended a beginner’s class, and the instructor taught me the basics of riding on these ramps. I was absolutely terrified at first, but by the end of the class, I was  able to go up and down the smallest of them, and I had a blast.       When we got back to the hotel, we had a nice room -service dinner, and then the three of us watched the movie Finding Nemo on the hotel television. It was a lovely little trip.        Before Fifth grade started, I went with my father and Soumaya to a dinner party at their friend’s house. I forgot who these friends were, but it was a nice house in Beverly Hills. There were lots of guests, and I did what I usually did at such dinner parties…  I sat around eating snacks and talked with my sister, sometimes going to father and to ask  for a sip of wine.       During this party, I found myself having a conversation with father, Soumaya, and one of the party guests, a boisterous middle -aged man who  I can’t recall the name of. Father and Soumaya were talking about how I just turned ten years old, and we discussed life and what the future had in store for me. This man we were talking to… he patted me on the back and told me that I have a great life ah ead of me. With a grin on his face, he told me that “in the next ten years,  you’ll have a great time… a great time”. I had no idea what he meant by that. I wasn’t even thinking about my future at that point ; I was living in the moment.       Now I know what he meant. Childhood is fun, but when a boy reaches puberty a whole new world opens up to him… a whole new world with new pleasures, such as sex and love. Other boys will experience this, but not me, it pains me  to say. That is the basis of my tragic life . I will not have a great time in the next ten years. The pleasures of sex and love will be denied to me. Other boys will experience it, but not me. Instead, I will only experience misery, rejection, loneliness, and pain.       At that moment in time, I didn’t think much about this man’s comment. I don’t even remember who he was. But after those ten years have passed and I’ve experienced what I’ve experienced, I can’t help but think about that moment. If only I knew what was in store for me, right then and t here.        It was time to begin Fifth Grade. It started out excellently. My teacher was named Mrs. Damart, and she would always be very kind to me.  [20]     For the first week of Fifth Grade, I was at mother’s house. I considered myself to be very “cool” by now. I had gotten better at skateboarding, I had blonde hair, and I dressed like a skateboarder. I felt great anticipation for what the cool kids woul d think of me once they saw my transformation.       To my disappointment, no one really cared. They were all in their own worlds. I don’t remember any kids showing recognition of my new “coolness”. Eventually, I was regarded differently than I was in Fourt h grade, which I became content with. The cool kids talked to me more, and I started hanging out with them during recess and lunch.       When father’s week came, I felt frustrated because I didn’t have enough cool clothes there, and it took a while for me  to get father to find the time to buy some for me.  Mother always got me what I wanted, right when I wanted it. At mother’s house,  all of my needs were met with excellent  precision, whereas at father’s house, there would always be a time delay because fath er and Soumaya had less time for me, and paid less attention to me.        Shortly after my Fifth grade year began, my mother decided to move out of the Red House to a small house in Woodland Hills. This new house was located on Topanga Canyon ",1
"36","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","Boulevard, n ear Dumetz street. Father’s house was just up the hill from there, so it was practically walking distance to father’s house.       I would miss the Red House, despite its smallness and the fact that I had to share a room with my sister. I had some very goo d times there. This new house was more convenient. It was still a two bedroom house, but one room was big enough to be split in two, and so by having a wall built in the middle, my sister and I each got our own room.        As I got better and better at ska teboarding, my mother made an effort to take me to a skatepark every week. By now, skateboarding wasn’t just a sport I was doing to copy the cool kids. I was truly interested in the sport. I even had hopes and dreams of becoming a professional skateboarder . That became my life goal. I loved skateboarding so much.  I pictured myself doing amazing tricks in front of a cheering crowd, just like I saw Tony Hawk do in some videos. I pictured the admiration on their faces, and it was awesome.       The skatepark my  mother took me to was Northridge Skatepark, and she would take me there every Friday. Northridge Skatepark was an average -sized outdoor skatepark with fine wooden ramps. First, we would have dinner at the Northridge Mall, and then I would sign up for the 7pm to 10pm session at the skatepark. I usually went alone, but after a few weeks of going I made a few acquaintances there, and people knew me. This became a Friday tradition during mother’s week.       On the following Saturday, James usually came over fo r a sleepover. We would play Nintendo 64 games like Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater and Donkey Kong late into the night, and then on Sunday morning mother would take us both to Skatelab, an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley. James had become really  interested in skat eboarding too, or so I believed. I was always better at it than him though, and I liked it that way.       This was the way every weekend went during mother’s week, and I had the time of my life.        I was so interested in skateboarding that I took my skateboard trick -or-treating for Halloween. My costume, of course, was myself as a skateboarder. We went to the Lemelson’s for a nice dinner and then set out to collect our candy. It was quite tricky  to hold a bag full of candy while skateboarding, but I had fun. I remember some teenagers seeing me  on my skateboard  and saying “why didn’t I think of that”. Hah, that was gratifying.        For Christmas, my mother bought me the new Playstation 2. I had b een wanting it for a long time, and when I unwrapped the present and saw the box, I felt so elated. Beforehand, the only video game [21]console I played was the Nintendo 64 (and the Gameboy, if that counts). The Playstation 2 was much more advanced in graphics , and it amazed me.       When mother announced that I would have to share it with my sister Georgia and that I can’t keep it in my room, my excitement turned to indignation, and I threw quite a t antrum. After crying for a bit, I calmed down and settled to sharing it with Georgia. She wouldn’t be using it much anyways, I told myself.        Even after getting a Playstation 2, I still played my Nintendo 64 a lot because I loved the games I had for it, and I had an emotional attachment to it. The Nintendo 64 w as the first video game console I played, and it would always have a special place in my heart.            One day during winter break at father’s house, father and Soumaya went out for a few hours and left me and my sister with Tracy. When they came back,  they had a little puppy with them, and announced that it was our new pet . It was mainly a present for Georgia. Georgia had been desperately asking father for a pet puppy for the last year, but I didn’t think he would actually go through with it. I was so shocked that we now had a dog. I was always afraid of dogs when I was lit tle, and I never imagined having one as a pet. The only pets I’ve had previously were my turtle and iguana, who both died within a year of acquiring them. Georgia was given the choice on what to name the puppy, and she named it Lucky. I thought this was a very lame and stupid name.        When I returned to school after the winter break, I noticed that all the cool kids had another interest: Hacky sacking. It was a simple sport consisting of kicking a bean -sack into the air as many times as you can without i t landing on the floor. They all had hacky sacks, and they would spend recess and lunch kicking them with each other, since skateboarding wasn’t allowed on school grounds. I didn’t have a hacky sack, and I decided that I needed to do something about that. Mother took me to the store Pac Sun where I got a hacky sack with an orange and green design . When we got home from the mall, I started practicing. I remember struggling with it first, but I spent the next few afternoons concentrating on getting good at it . I spent many hours well into the night practicing in my backyard.       Once I was able to kick the hacky sack properly, I made a big deal of the fact that I was now interested in it. I would go up to the group of cool kids and show off my skills, and I p layed with it every single minute I spent outside during sch ool time.        The Upper playground was rebuilt over the break, and there was a brand new playground to play on. I always loved brand new things, and the new playground was quite engaging. On the  very first day that we were allowed to use it, I  played tag with Philip Bloeser, Addison Altendorf, Bryce Jacobs, and a few others.        I never really became good friends with the so -called “cool kids”. I would see them more as competitors than friends.  During recess and lunch, I mainly played with Philip and his little clique which consisted of Addison Altendorf, Kevin, and T.J Tassone.       I made a few Fourth G rade frie nds through hacky sacking, though I forget their names. I mainly played with them during recess and lunch. One day, after I stayed an hour after school at the Upper, I was hacking sacking with them and I kicked my hacky sack up onto a roof. It wasn’t first hacky sack, thank goodness, but I was quite fond of it and I was sad to lose it. I wonder if it’s still up there… No, it would have been cleared away by now.        I still refused to have any playdates when I was at my father’ s house due to the incident with Soumaya in Fourth Grade. Because of this, my father and Soumaya became concern ed that I didn’t have any friends.  [22]     Soumaya forced me to befriend some of the neighbor ’s kids who live d just down the road. They would often skateboard outside of their houses. I was aghast… the prospect of walking up to a bunch of kids who I didn’t k now and asking to play with them was terrifying to me. They were “cool” skateboarders, and that made it even more intimidating. Of course, I wanted  to be friends with them and join in their fun, but I was too scared that they would think I’m weird. I have always been shy by nature.       Soumaya didn’t understand this, and she gave me no choice in the matter. She sent me out of the house and wouldn’t let me back in until I introduce d myself to them. I tried pretending that I was playing with them, but instea d I would hide in a quiet street corner. To my surprise, Soumaya somehow knew I was doing this, and she came to confront me. She then got Tracy to take me down to where the kids were playing and push me into it. Tracy went up to the kids and asked if I cou ld play with them. I felt embarrassed and timid, but they welcomed me.       I always had the subconscious preconception that the coolest kids were mean and aggressive by nature, which is quite true, and I was shocked that these kids were being nice to me and letting me play with them. After a fun afternoon skateboarding around the streets of Woodland Hills, I regretted not befriending them sooner. They went to Woodland Hills Elementary School, the school my sister would soon go to.       A couple of weeks later, Soumaya forced me to befriend yet another group of Woodland Hills kids. This second group lived nearer to my house, and they weren’t skateboarders, however they liked riding bikes and scooters. One of them was a black boy named Lucky  Radley, who I t hought was very nice at the time.  I found it strange that he had the same name as my dog.  He was a fourth grader, and he would later go to the same middle school as me, where he would become an object of my extreme  jealousy and hatred. Looking back, I can’t believe I actually played with him as a friend in my father’s neighborhood.       In the spring, uncle Jonny and the cousins  came to stay at father’s house. Cousin George bunked with me in my room, and the two of us became in stant friends. I hadn’t seen him since my last trip to England, and back then we were little kids. I enjoyed having a friend to play with on a daily basis without having to arrange a playdate, and the week that they stayed with us was great fun. I once too k him along to play on scooters and skateboards ",1
"37","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","with the neighbor kids, and we also went to the beach a lot .      Indeed, it was a great week, and I was sad to see them go. I looked forward to seeing him again when we were to go  on our vacation to France a nd England in the coming summer.        After Jonny and the cousins left, Soumaya’s mother Khadija came to stay for a few months, and I was made to share my room with her, because father had converted two of the guest rooms into his office, and Tracy was staying in the downstairs room. I had an extra bed in my room, so I suppose it made sense to them. I was a bit annoyed with this  at the start, but I bonded well with Khadija, so I soon became ok with it. She was like a third grandmother to me.       My mother attained  tickets to the red carpet premiere Star Wars Episode 2: Attack of the Clones. We received four tickets. Georgia was old enough to go, and I persuaded mother to let me give the fourth ticket to James. I was awestruck by the time the movie en ded. It found it to be absolutely phenomenal. James and I talked about it for hours afterward.        My life at school was starting to become mediocre again, and I became frustrated with my struggle to be cool. I didn’t have a regular group of friends who  I always played with. I was like a nomad, moving from group to group and trying to fit in with each one, but never fully integrating. I feared that the cool kids didn’t regard me as one of them, and even Philip’s clique never considered me one of their co re [23]friends. Despite all of my attempts to be cool, I didn’t feel as if the other kids respected me as such. I was still quite the outcast, as I always will be.       My social life changed somewhat when Mrs. Damart announced that we would have new seating arrangements in class, and the process of deciding on who sits where was up to us. Our class consisted of tables that seated about five to six people, and when our name was called randomly, we could choose anywhere to sit, meaning that everyone had a chance  to sit with their group of friends. I didn’t have a core group of friends, so I was thrown into a state of panic.       Originally, I was sitting at the table where Philip’s clique sat, but all of their names were called before me, and I was booted from t heir table. At this point, I just chose to sit anywhere, and I ended up sitting next to John Jo Glen. Matt Bordier and Danny Dayani also sat at our table. These were kids who I regarded as cool, so I was content with sitting with them.       I never really interacted with John Jo Glen that much in the past. He was one of the biggest jerks of the school, next to Tr evor and Keaton. We quarreled a  bit at the start, but  soon enough we started socializ ing, and I talked with him about some new games I got for my P laystation 2. We became friends when John Jo suddenly asked me if he can come over to my house. I felt happy that he asked me this… it would be the first playdate I would have without my mother arranging it for me. This would spark a fun new friendship tha t would last well after Fifth Grade. The random seating arrangement next to John Jo was the best thing to happen to me in Elementary School.        Despite my struggles to be regarded as “cool” and my obsession with attaining such recognition, Fifth grade was my favorite school year in Elementary School. I played with more people than I ever did in previous grades, I was less shy, I wasn’t a dork , and I had an awesome time learning how to skateboard and hacky sack. It was memorable year filled with joyful experiences.       I didn’t want the school year to end. Once Fifth grade was  over, I will have to go to Middle School, and the prospect filled me with anxiety. My little innocent mind always looked at Middle School as something far in the future, when I grow up. I didn’t want to grow up. I was enjoying my life as a kid right at that moment. I didn’t think about the future.       Kids in my class told many rumors of Middle School life that filled me with fear and sent a shiver through my spine. Even through watching movies and T.V. shows I got a glimpse of what was in store for a Middle Schooler. There was talk of girls, and how it would soon be “c ool” to be popular with the girls. Girls were like completely foreign creatures to me. I never interacted with them… I wasn’t expected to. In Elementary School, boys played with boys and girls played with girls. That was what I was used to. That was my wor ld. I heard stories of how boys are expected to start kissing girls in Middle School! Such things overwhelmed me. I tried to dismiss it as much as I could and enjoy my life in the present moment.        My school arranged a camping trip for the entire Fifth  Grade class before graduation day. At first I didn’t want to go because I would be away from my parents for five days, something I was never used to. I was afraid I would get too homesick. I never spent more than one night away from my parents. On the rar e occasion that they had to go out of town for a few days and left me with a nanny, I would cry at night.       My teacher Mrs. Damart  came up to me one morning before class started and persuaded me to go, saying that the graduation trip was something I wo uldn’t want to miss. It would be a once in a lifetime experience, and after some hesitation I agreed to go along.       I forgot exactly where this camping trip took place. It  was located at a special camping retreat somewhere in the forest to the north  of Los Angeles. It was very secluded… a small village of cabins and tents surrounded by wilderness and hiking trails. For the trip there, I decided to go with my friends Bryce and Charlie in a car instead of taking the school bus with everyone else. This was  much more comfortable, and I was glad to have snagged a spot in the car with them.  [24]     Everyone was assigned to groups of five to share a cabin or a tent. I was originally placed in the group with Charlie, Bryce, and a few others… but that group was giv en a tent to sleep in. I was appalled by how drab and uncomfortable the tents looked. I wanted a cabin. So I went to my teacher and asked to be transferred to a group that was  sleeping in a cabin. She placed me in a group of some cool skateboarder kids, in cluding Michael, Sam, Trevor, Matt, and Stephen. I felt a sense of pride to be part of this group.       During the daytime on this trip, the whole Fifth Grade class participated in games, outdoor activities, nature hikes, and barbeques. It was great fun. Nighttime in the cabin was like having a sleepover with five people, and it was a new experience that excited me. Before bedtime, Michael Ray took out a magazine that had pictures of beautiful  model  women, and all of the boys gathered around and looked at them. So… even at the early age of ten, boys were starting to be attracted to the female body. I didn’t understand this… I hadn’t yet reached that stage. I pretended to be interested just so that I wouldn’t appear uncool. All of those boys probably lost th eir virginity by sixteen. Damn them.       The trip ended up being so fun that I didn’t cry at all about being away from my parents for so long.         And finally, it was time to graduate from Elementary School. Before the ceremony, our whole class watched  a video full of footage of school life throughout the year. I saw a few glimpses of myself caught in the footage, and I felt gratified. My life at Topanga Elementary School  was a blast, full of memorable experiences and wonderful times.       I dressed in  a nice shirt with a tie for the ceremony. All of the Fifth Graders lined up and walked down an isle through the center of the Auditorium, with the audience of parents and siblings on either side. When I saw my parents, they looked so proud of me. Each stu dent had to walk up to their teacher on the stage and receive a graduation award. We weren’t required to g ive a speech, to my relief. I would be too nervous to talk in front of an audience. The graduation theme song was “Time of Your Life” by the band Gree n Day, one of my favorite bands. Whenever I would hear this song again, I would think about that glorious day, and the memories would make me feel an extreme sense of nostalgia. In the afternoon, there was a graduation party at the Top of Topanga community  recreation center, a lovely place that provided a view of the whole Valley.       My mother took me to have dinner at the sushi restaurant Kabuki afterwards. It was just me and her. As we sat down at the restaurant  after all the excitement, I took a moment  to fully ponder over the fact that Elementary School was all over. It was done. I felt so accomplished and proud… I was happy, things were good. But along with that happiness was a feeling of sadness that I will be leaving all of those experiences behind.  A whole chapter of my lif e had just passed, and a new one was beginning. That day  was such  an extraordinary day. A day to remember, a memory to cherish.        For the first few weeks of su mmer, mother arranged playdates with various ",1
"38","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","friends and acquaintan ces I made from Topanga Elementary, including Trevor Bourget, Matt Bordier, Charlie Converse, John Jo Glen, and Philip Bloeser. It was interesting to h ave Trevor and Matt over. I never thought I would have playdates with them. Matt was one of the coolest k ids in the school; he was a skateboarder and a baseball player who seemed to garner respect from everyone. I  envied him during Elementary School even when we were friends, and I would deeply envy and hate him  later on in life, when I find out how much succ ess he would have with girls.       Again, I repeat, that as children we all play  together  as equals in a fair environment. Only after the advent of puberty does the true brutality of human nature show its face. Life will become a bitter and unfair struggle  for self -worth, all because girls will choose some boys over others. The boys who girls find attractive will live pleasure -filled lives while they dominate the boys who girls deem unworthy. Matt Bordier will go on to live a life of pleasure. Girls will th row themselves at him. And I will go on to be rejected and humiliated by girls. At that moment in time, we were  just playing together as children, oblivious to the fact that my future will be dark and his will be bright. Life is such a cruel joke.  [25]      My mother continued  to take me to Northridge Skatepark every Friday , and I also attended a skateboard camp at Pedlow Skatepark for a couple of weeks. At this camp I bumped into one of the kids I played with around father’s house.       I had been tryi ng very hard to get better at skateboarding , but when I saw that there were boys a lot younger than me who could do more tricks, I realized that I sucked. I was never good at sports or any physical activity, and when I discovered skateboarding, I thought that finally here was a sport that I could excel in and even became a professional at. It crushed me a little inside to see that I was a failure at skateboarding after more than a year of practicing it. I could never master the kickflip or heelflip. All I could do was the ollie jump and ride down a few ramps. I saw eight -year- old boys at the skatepark who could do a kickflip with ease, and it made me so angry. Why did I fail at everything I tried?  I asked myself. My dreams of becoming a professional skateboarder wer e over. I felt so defeated.       Because of this, my interest in skateboarding slowly faded away during this summer. James had recently told me that he was no longer interested in the sport, so I no longer had him to skateboard with anyway. I just decided to forget about it for the moment.        James’s family moved  to a new house in Malibu. The house was owned by the Lemelson’s , and they were staying in it temporarily. Mother took us there a few times where I adventured with James in the wilderness area that surrounded the house. We would often go to a small plaza in the center of Malibu . There was a playground there, with a few  shops and restaurants surrounding it.        It was time for my 11th birthday. I was at mother’s house and just decided to have a small playdate for my birthday. I invited James over, along with another kid who I had befriended at the Woodland Hills recre ation center. My mother made a small cake, I blew out the candles, and that was it. I was eleven years old.   11 Years Old        The trip to France and England began shortly after my birthday. We had been talking about it for a while at father’s house, and I was really excited to go. We traveled on Virgin Atlantic Upper Class. I was extremely  enthusiastic about this, as I alway s loved luxury and opulence.       We stopped by in England for a couple of days to say hello to grandma Jinx. The cousins weren’ t there, they were already in France,  so it was a bit boring. When we arrived in France, the feeling of wonder and curiosity sw ept over me as it always did when I visited a foreign country. The last time I was in France, I was only a few weeks old. This was the first time I was able to truly experience the country . France was a whole different world, and it was a world that I like d. French culture is so exquisite and refined compared to American culture.       After booking a couple of rooms at a small Inn near the town of Toulouse, we met up with Jonny and the cousin’s at Aunt Jenny’s house. Aunt Jenny is my father’s sister, and th e last time I saw her was when I lived in England, before the move to America. She had a few kittens in her house that I loved to play with.       George and I immediately resumed our friendship that started in the spring. There was a vast forested area sur rounding the house. George told me there were lots of wild boars in the forest, so we went “wild boar hunting”. It was just a game, and we never ended up seeing any boars at all, but the suspense of possibly finding one was what made it fun.       We stayed in Toulouse for about a week, and then we said goodbye to the relatives and set off to tour the country. We toured many cultural towns and stayed in castle -style hotels. This should have been a great experience for me, but my conflicts with Soumaya soured  it. There were a few incidents in [26]which she punished me by making me stay in my hotel room while she, father and Georgia all went out to dinner at a restaurant. I hated her for this.       On the way back, we stopped at grandma Jinx’s house in England for  a week. The cousins were there this time, and it was a lot of fun. We all slept in one room, so it was like having one big sleepover. One day we went on a trip to a museum, where I had an argument with Soumaya. She shouted at me in front of George and thr eatened to punish me. This was so embarrassing that I fell into a miserable mood for the rest of the day. I always loved traveling, but I learned that traveling with Soumaya just ruins the whole experience. And this wouldn’t be the last time I would be for ced to travel with Soumaya either, to my utmost dismay.       The trip lasted three weeks in length, the perfect length of time for a vacation, in my opinion. I quite enjoyed it, if I don’t count the times Soumaya ruined it.        It felt nice to be back h ome after a long, cultural vacation. At father’s house, my nanny Tracy got into an argument with father, and she was forced to leave. I was sad to see her go. She was always pleasant and fun to be around. Once Tracy left, Georgia and I would no longer have  any nannies. We were getting too old for it. I wasn’t a little child anymore… having nannies became a thing of the past. From now on, i f father and Soumaya had to go out to a dinner party, they would just hire  a baby -sitter to look after us, and soon I wo uld be old enough to stay by myself in the house.        I got a haircut, and this time I decided not to bleach my hair blonde. The black hair always grew out anyway, so the full -blonde look only lasted for a couple of weeks. Having blonde hair seemed to ha ve lost its spark, so I just didn’t bother with it anymore.        The summer was pleasant and relaxing, but it quickly came to an end. The time for Middle School had come. My fear of this day haunt ed the back of my mind all summer. I was enrolled at Pinecr est Middle School for Sixth Grade. I had mixed feelings about going to this school because I didn’t like my experience there during  kindergarten. Father said it’s the best option for me, because it was a small private school. I didn’t want to go to a large school like Hale Middle School… that would have been too overwhelming for me.       On the first day, I was shaking with  anxiety and fear. I didn’t know what to expect. Transitioning to Middle School was a big deal for me, even more so than starting elementary school. I was much older and I cared more about what people thought of me. I was no longer an innocent little child who didn’t have to worry. I had to worry about a lot of things, and oh, did I worry! It was a whole new school full of people I d idn’t  know. They all previously went to elementary school together, so most of them already knew each other. That made me even more nervo us. The only person I knew who was  going to Pinecrest was a geeky kid named  Nate Grossman, who I didn’t really interact with that much in Topanga.       I also felt an intense fear of what Middle School life would be like. I didn’t know how to act around girls, I didn’t know what was cool anymore, I had no friends there. I simply didn’t know what to do. I felt like I was wa lking into a snowstorm without a coat.       My parents led me into the school to say goodbye, and then it was time for me to start my first class. I had to take multiple classes with different teachers now. This was also a new concept for me and it made m e extremely uncomfortable. Since this was a private school, I had to wear a uniform, something I hadn’t done since going to Dorsett House in England. I thought of this as a good thing though… I didn’t have to worry about what I would have to wear on the fi rst day.       For the first few days, I withdrew into a defensive shell and didn’t ",1
"39","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","social situation during school time. A few girls continued to pay attention to me, saying hi as I walked by them and occasionally giving me hugs,  but I felt bitter at the fact that I wasn’t able to truly hang out with them like the popular boys were doing.       In order to not be seen as a complete loner at school, I ended up making friends with a kid named Connor Hanrahan. Connor was not a popula r kid, because girls didn’t like him. Despite this, he was one of the most pompous assholes of the school, even more so than any of the most popular boys. Con nor was a true bully. I started hanging out with him during recess and lunch, and we made a few jo kes with each other and had a few  good laughs, but he would always push me around and act tough. I was so timid back then that I didn’t care. I just wanted someone to hang out with.       When I stayed back after school one day, my mother saw me with Conno r when she came to pick me up. She has been concerned about me not making any new friends at Pinecrest, and I suppose she was relieved to see me with a “friend”. She invited Connor to come over to my house, which he accepted. I was a bit hesitant to invite  anyone from Pinecrest to my mother’s house, because it was located in Canoga Park, a bad area, and most of the kids at Pinecrest were upper -middle class  who would look down  on me for living there . But I couldn’t back out of this once my mother invited Con nor. He came over and all went well, we played a few video games for a couple of hours. But after that playdate, he would always rip on me for living in a “poor” house. He would also tell other kids at Pinecrest about it. This infuriated me to no end, and I would keep proclaiming that my father lives in a prestigious three -story house in the Woodland Hills Heights. I became vehemently obsessed with proving to Connor and everyone else that I wasn’t poor. I went so far as to bring pictures of my father’s hous e to school. I even considered inviting some people over to father’s house, but I remembered my vow of never doing that due to the possibility that another incident would happen with Soumaya, like the one that occurred years ago.        It was at eleven years old when I first started using the internet on a regular basis. The internet was still considered a new phenomenon at the time. Before eleven, I roughly knew how to browse websites and use email, but once I fully immersed myself  in it, it really fascinated me.       The popular social networking tool at that period was AOL instant messenger, or “AIM”. I made my first AIM account on my mother’s computer, and she would let have one hour a day to explore it. I joined a few chat rooms. The prospect of talking to strangers from a computer was new and astounding to me.       Towards the end of sixth grade, I still hadn’t made a group of friends who I could see outside of school. The only social interactions I had outside of school were playdates with old friends from Topanga every now and again. Joining chatrooms through AOL temporarily filled in the social void for a few weeks. This will definitely not be the first time I would try to fill in that void with the internet.       Once I est ablished myself in the chat rooms, I made a few friends who I instant messaged frequently. Most of them were in middle school and some were in high school. I also talked to a few people I knew from Pinecrest over AIM.       One friend who I met through a c hat room suddenly emailed me pictures of beautiful naked girls, telling me to “check this out”. When I looked at the pictures, I was shocked beyond words. I had never  seen  what beautiful girls looked like naked, and the sight filled me with strong and over whelming emotions. I didn’t know what was happening to me. Was it the first inkling of sexual desire in my body? I [30]was traumatized. My childhood was fading away. Ominous fear swept over me, and I stopped talking to that person.        As the Sixth Grade year came to a close, I felt dissatisfied and insignificant. Indeed, a whole new world had opened up before me, and I had no idea how to prevail in it. I still wanted to live as a child.       I never established any proper friends at Pinecrest, and the only playdate I had was the one with Connor that my mother arranged, and that turned out to be a disaster for me. My mother and father both showed concern that I wasn’t making any friends, but because I still saw some friends from Topanga, they didn’t make a big deal out of it.       I consider Sixth Grade to be the better year out of the three years I would spend in Middle School. Girls actually paid attention to me. They knew who I was and I didn’t feel like I was completely invisibl e. I was extremely shy with girls and could barely have a conversation with them, but I still interacted with girls more during this year than I would for any following year. The cool kids treated me nicely, despite my reputation as the “quiet kid”. I alwa ys felt like a loser compared to them, and I hated them for it, though I still wanted their approval. I wanted to be one of them… I wanted to be their friend.       The closest I came to truly being one of them was when Vinny and Robert both invited me to their birthday parties, which were only a couple of weeks apart at the very end of the school year. Both parties were at Skatelab skatepark. I hadn’t been to Skatelab for about a year, and when I walked in, all of the memories of going there with James filled my mind. I hadn’t even skateboarded for a while, but after a few  minutes on the ramps my ability came back like magic. They were all quite impressed. I bet they thought I would end up sucking at it. I was happy to prove them wrong.       Indeed, Sixth G rade was the peak of my life at Pinecrest. It would only go downhill from there .       My mother bought  me a brand new video game console, the Xbox. I heard a lot of kids talking about how great the Xbox was at school, so I was really eager to have one. I liked the Xbox much more than the Playstation 2. The graphics were better and the games were more to my taste. With the Xbox, I got the game Halo. At first, I found Halo to be very difficult and I gave up on it a few times. I had no idea that Halo would so on become one of my favorite video game series that I ever played.        I was extremely happy and relieved when summer came. Middle School was much more stressful than Elementary School, both socially and academically. Summer would provide a well -needed b reak from all of it.       I started seeing some old friends from Topanga more frequently. Among these were John Jo Glen and Charlie Converse. Charlie wasn’t really one of my main friends at Topanga Elementary. I had a few playdates with him here and there,  but not that many. It was only until after Fifth Grade graduation that our real friendship began. He always had a charming  and humble  personality, and he was well -liked by everyone at Topanga.  He came over to my mother’s house a few times after I got my X box, where he tried to help me get past the hardest level on Halo.  John Jo and Charlie were very close friends  with each other, and eventually I would start to see them at the same time.       John Jo invited me to his father’s apartment in Hollywood for a sleepover. I found his apartment to be very dingy, but I had so much fun that I didn’t even care. He lived just across the street from the huge Scientology building. We got together with a group of his friends and snuck into the building’s courtyard at night to play hide -and-seek tag. This was the first time I had been out having fun with a group of kids my age without any adult supervision. It was very amusing. When we went back to his ap artment, we played Conker’s Bad Fur Day on the Nintendo 64. The Nintendo 64 was a very old console at this point in time,  especially after I now had an Xbox and a PS2,  but I was entertained by Conker’s Bad Fur Day so much that I asked my mother to buy it f or me the next day.   [31]     James Ellis moved  yet again to another house in the Palisades. After the death of his mother, James’s father Art e quickly made the decision to move again. Arte  rented a small house on Temecula Street, near the renowned  Palisades Bluffs. There  they would remain for a very long time, and all of the most significant experiences I would have with James in th e future would take place there.       At this time, though, I wasn’t seeing James that much. We slowly drifted apart after we los t our common interest in skateboarding. We still considered each other friends, and we would still see each other occasionally, almost as a courtesy. But our friendship would be at a standstill during our middle school years.        I was enjoy ing a lovely summer, but sud denly my mother said that I had  to go to summer camp at Pinecrest. This was a decision she made with my father, because they thought it would be healthy for me. I didn’t like this one bit. It was a last minute decision. One moment I was rela xing and ",1
"40","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","enjoying my summer break, the next my mother is waking me up early to take me to my first day of camp at Pinecrest. Gratefully, summer camp would only last for four weeks.       Summer camp at Pinecrest was located at the Elementary School section , and I recognized my old kindergarten class. It was a mix of middle school and elementary school kids, and I made a few friends with some kids who were younger than me.       At this camp, an incident happened that would scar me for life. The first time t hat I was treated badly by a girl occurred at this camp. I was innocently playing with the friends I made, and they were tickling me, something people always did because I was very ticklish. I accidently bumped into a pretty girl the same age as me, and sh e got very angry. She cursed at me and pushed me, embarrassing me in front of my friends. I didn’t know who this girl was … She was only at Pinecrest for summer camp… But she was very pretty, and she was taller than me. I immediately froze up and went into a state of shock. One of my friends asked me if I was ok, and I didn’t answer. I remained very quiet for the rest of the day.       I couldn’t believe what had happened. Cruel treatment from women is ten times worse than from men. It made me feel like an i nsignificant, unworthy little mouse. I felt so small and vulnerable. I couldn’t believe that this girl was so horrible to me, and I thought that it was because she viewed me  as a loser. Th at was the first experience of female cruelty I endured, and it trau matized me to no end. It made me even more nervous around girls, and I would be extremely weary and cautious of them from that point on.       Before summer camp ended, I saw th at same girl hanging out with Oren Aks a few times. Oren Aks  was one of the popular kids in my grade. I hated Oren so much when I saw him with her.  It made me feel so inferior… that this girl was mean to me and yet she liked  Oren.  Thankfully, Oren wouldn’t be returning to Pinecrest for Seventh Grade, and I would ne ver see him again. I wonder what became of him…  I bet he lived a good life.        I felt relieved when summer camp ended. That experience with the mean girl ruined it for me. Hell, it ruined a part of my life. Whenever I think about summer camp I would th ink about that girl, and my emotions would flare up.       My 12th birthday followed. I decided not to do anything for it. Mother took me and my sister out to a Japanese restaurant to celebrate it. Twelve seemed like a big number to me back then. One more year and I would be a teenager. It was hard to believe.   12 Years Old        For the rest of the summer, I resumed my routine of relaxing and having playdates. I tried to forget about what happened at summer camp as much as I could.  [32]     John Jo came over to my house, where he slept over for the first time. We played a few video games, and then he told me that he wanted  to take me to a place called Pla net Cyber, a cyber café that had all of the best online PC games. I knew nothing of the sort, but it was just down the street from my mother’s house. I walked there with him, eager to experience something new.       This was my first experience with online gaming. Playing video games with people  over the internet invoked a whole new level of fascination in me. Talking to people over AIM was fun and new, but this… this was tremendous. I always loved playing multiplayer mode on video games when I had friends over. With online gaming, I could do it whenever I want. I was a novice to these new games on the PC, but I got the hang of it after playing with John Jo for a few hours. The games we played were Day of Defeat and Counter Strike.        Mother took  me and Georgia on two little vacation trips in the same week. For the first trip we went to Long Beach, where we stayed at the Hyatt hotel. It reminded me of our litt le trip to Ventura two years previously . We visited the Harbor and the aquarium. The three of us really bonded on this trip.       We went home for a couple of days before going on the second trip. For th e second  trip, we went to Legoland and stayed at the resort there. The resort was exceedingly beautiful, with a huge swimming pool and spa. We met up with a family of one of Georgia’s friends and explored the entirety of Legoland.         When we got home from our marvelous trip, I had another sleepover with John Jo. He loved the fact that I lived near Planet Cyber, so he would soon be calling every week, asking to come over.       I saw Charlie a few days later. Charlie was also familiar with Planet Cyber, and when the two of us went there, he introduced me to an RPG game called Diablo 2. I didn’t know what to make of this game, it was like an adventure game similar to Banjo Kazooi e and Donkey Kong, but much more mature, with the ability to interact with other players online.       It was only a matter of time before I started inviting John Jo and Charlie to sleep over at the same time. When the three of us went to Planet Cyber as a  group, I had an absolute blast.  It was one of the best experiences of my life.        At father’s house, father would frequently invite his new friend Alex ander  Bubenheim over. Alex Bubenheim was a boisterous German man who worked as a composer and lived i n the Top of Topanga community. Alex had a son named Lukas, who was a couple of years younger than Georgia. Lukas was a very girly and immature little boy, but I found him to be very amusing. They would come over almost every weekend that I was at father’s , and bec ome a big part of my life there.        Seventh Grade began. My coveted summer break was all over. On the first day, I noticed some people I met during  summer  camp start school there as Sixth Graders. One of them was Patrick Dib, the younger brother of Alex Dib. I would always view Patrick Dib as an obnoxious, rude lout. He was very ugly too, and it annoyed me that he carried himself around as if he wasn’t a freckled, chubby -faced imbecile.       I said hello to everyone I knew from last year, includ ing Robert Morgan and his clique of popular kids. There were also a flock of new kids who transferred from the Pinecrest in Van Nuys. I was soon to meet them. Among these were Alfred Graham, Anthony Glukov, Jonny Noone, Derek Olsen, Garrett, Rafael, and Ed ward. They already knew each other and always hung out together at the start of the year, but I soon noticed that each of them soon integrated into the already pre -established cliques of Pinecrest. I was jealous that Jonny Noone, an obnoxious Mexican kid, immediately became popular with the skateboarders because of his cocky attitude.       Alfred Graham, a half -black boy whom I would have a semi -friendship with throughout the years was intensely disliked by everyone, mainly because he was ugly and had a ha bit of intentionally annoying [33]people. He would eventually become friends with the skateboarders, however, due to his interest in the sport.       My reputation as the “shy kid” continued, and I still didn’t make any friends who became close enough to see ou tside of school. I did socialize with various groups during school hours, so I wasn’t a complete outcast during Seventh Grade.        James Ellis started  middle school at Paul Revere Middle School as a Sixth Grader. Though he is the same age as I am, he was  held back a year in elementary school. Coincidentally, he went to the same school as John Jo, Charlie, and a few other friends from Topanga.      After this point, I would stop seeing James Ellis for a while. Our friendship became temporarily stale and wo uld remain so for another year. The only time we saw each other during this period was when we had family get -togethers. James’s sister, Sage, often came over to play with Georgia, while James didn’t bother to come at all.        John Jo and Charlie started  to come over every Friday. This would soon become a tradition. Fridays were always my favorite time of the week, and this tradition made me always look forward to Fridays with intense eagerness. They would be dropped off by their parents shortly after sch ool time, and then we would all walk to Planet Cyber and play games for hours.       After a few of these Frida y sleepovers, Charlie introduced  me to his friend Elijah. Elijah was temporarily stay ing at Charlie’s house, and the two of them  were like brother s. I immediately took a great liking to Elijah , and we became instant friends. He helped me beat some of the hardest levels of Halo. Elijah would then come over with Charlie and John Jo, and the four of us became a close group of friends. This was the only  true social group I would ever have, and I had a great time with them.       We sometimes hung out at Planet Cyber until 3:00 in the morning, the latest I had ever been out without parent supervision. We would switch between playing Halo at my house, playi ng games at Planet Cyber, or skateboarding around the neighborhood. I briefly got back into skateboarding ",1
"41","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","for the sake of enjoying it with these friends.  On the following Saturday morning, we would wake up by 9:00, have breakfast at Krispy Kreme and spend a few more ho urs at Planet Cyber before my friends were picked up by their parents. I would then go to father’s house for the weekend, if father was in town.        My sister Georgia’s birthday was in November, and on that day my father hired a limo to pick up Georgia and her friends from mother’s house. Charlie and Elijah came over, though John Jo was absent that day. When the limo returned, we all celebrated Ge orgia’s birthday at the house together. I introduced father to my friends. It was a very happy experience.        When the winter break finally arrived, my grandma Ah Mah came  over from England to visit, and she stayed  in the fourth bedroom at mother’s house. Ah Mah is just like my mother, she always knew what I liked and went out of her way to get it for me, just to put a smile on my face. She brought with her some of my favorite English chocolates, along with her famous peanut cookies that I love d so much.         Mother h ad a party at her house, and a lot of family friends came over, including Maddy and her mom, James and his family, Philip and Jeffrey and their family, and a lot of mother’s old friends whom I hadn’t seen for a long time. Ah Mah, who is a p rofessional cook, made some of her special dishes, and we set up a bouncy castle in our backyard. I invited John Jo, Charlie, and Elijah over, and we walked to Planet Cyber for a little bit, then walked back home and had some fun on the Bouncy Castle. Jame s never really liked my group of friends… he told me he thought  they were jerks. I suppose he was  right about John Jo, but Charlie and Elijah were always nice people. Oh well, I never really liked James’s friends either, so that made us even, I guess.  [34]     I had a great time during this party. James and Maddy were the last ones to leave. Me and my sister played with them for a while on the bouncy castle. It made for an interesting and peculiar experience, playing with both James and Maddy at the same ti me, my two oldest friends. It  had been a long time since I had  seen Maddy, and it would be the last time that we would ever play together as friends. Before the night was over, we all took a picture together outside my mother’s front door. James made a funny face for it, while I stood behind him awkwardly waving my hand. To this very day, my mother still has that picture in one of her photo albums.        One time when John Jo, Charlie, and Elijah came over for our traditional Friday night sleepover, we met up with Armando and his younger brother Gus. I hadn’t seen them since Topanga Elementary school. We had a good time skateboarding with them at the church parking lot near mother’s house, and all over that area. Afterwards, we had some video game competitio ns at Planet Cyber.        My mother took me to watch Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in the movie theatres. I already saw the first two movies, but I wasn’t a huge fan of the series until I saw this third one in the movie theatres. Watching that movi e in the theatres was such an epic experience, and I will always remember it. Though it wasn’t as exciting as going to the red carpet premieres of the Star Wars prequels, it came quite close.       After the movie, mother and I ate dinner at TGI Friday’s. W hen we got home, as I was getting ready for bed, I heard a knock on my door. It was Elijah asking if I wanted to go with him to Planet Cyber, which I did for a few hours.       That day marked the last time I would ever go to the movi e theatres with just my  mother, except for premieres. Growing up, I always loved it when my parents took me to the movi es. The  large screen and loud surround- sound immersed me into the movie, and I liked that dizzy feeling I would feel when I walked out of a movie theatre and en tered back into the real world. It was always a remarkable experience.       Soon enough, the movie theatres would turn from a place of joy to a place of dread. Once puberty arrives, I would start getting jealous of all the young couples or groups of boys and girls who go to the movies together. That day that I saw the final Lord of the Rings movie was the last time I enjoyed the movie theatres in peace, without fear of humiliation.        Aside from Fridays, I always met my group of friends at Planet Cyber on Wednesday s, because they were charging only one dollar per hour on Wednesdays. Usually my mother wouldn’t let me play video games for such a long time on a weekday, but she made an exception for Wednesdays.       On one such Wednesday, Charlie introd uced me to the game Warcraft 3 . It was like no game I had ever played before. It enabled the player to build an army and battle against other players online. After the first round of Warcraft III, going up against John Jo and Charlie, I was captivated. The  game was so much fun. I couldn’t help but think about it ever y second for the next two days. When the following Friday arrived, we playe d it for most of the day  and well into the night .       My initially happy interest in the game Warcraf t 3 had an omino us tone to it. This was the beginning of a long relationship with the Warcraft franchise. In less than a year from that point, they would release their ultimate game, World of Warcraft, a game that I would find sanctuary in for most of my teenage years.        Seventh Grade flew by very fast. My school life was a continuation of Sixth Grade. I mingled with acquaintances here and there and behaved nicely with everyone. The difference is that I was having so much fun outside of school with my friends at Planet  Cyber that I didn’t really care a bout getting popular at school or getting attention from girls. I was enjoying my very last year of childhood. My twelfth year [35]was one of the best years of my life, and the last year that I was happy. I’m glad that I can a t least say I made the best of it.       I gave no thought at all to my future, or the fact that puberty was just around the corner.  I barely even knew much about what puberty was. With puberty, my whole world would change, and my entire life would collapse  into utter despair. I wonder how I would have handled things if I knew… If was prepared…        This summer was long awaited. I was having the time of my life, and once school was out I couldn’t wait to spe nd the summer relaxing and doing fun things. I was  relieved that neither of my parents made me attend summer camp. I suppose I had gotten too old for it. This summer was mine to enjoy however I wanted. It was like a coveted treasure that I could only hold for a few moments, but those moments would last fo rever in memory. It wa s my last summer before puberty. My last summer of innocence.  My last summer of true happiness and satisfaction with life.        I continue d my traditional Friday sleepovers wit h Charlie, John Jo, and Elijah. Because there was no more school, they would sometimes come over on other days as well. I managed to beat the entire game of Halo on legendary mode with Elijah’s help, an impressive feat.       Philip and Jeffrey came over quit e a lot as well. Philip was always  the mature and ins ightful brother, while Jeffrey was the wild and funny one. Seeing the two of them together always made for an interesting and excitable mix. Their mother, Kathy, brought them over on weekdays quite often. We drank a lot of soda, at e a lot of candy, and played with scooters and skateboards around my mother’s neighborhood. I took them to Planet Cyber one time and showed them some of the games there.       On the weekends I spent at father’s, we usually did something with the Bubenheims . They lived in the Top of Topanga community, where we often spent afternoons. I played with Georgia and Lukas in the swimming pool there, and being one who admires great views, I spent a lot of time looking out at the Valley. Going to that place would always remind me of my Fift h Grade graduation party, a good memory.        Soumaya told  us extraordinary news. On one sunny afternoon at father’s, me and my sister were asked to come to the dining room for a special announcement. It wasn’t announced by words, but by Soumaya indicatin g us to feel her stomach. She was pregnant! She and my father were having their first baby together. I was going to have a baby brother.      I felt elated. I remember when I was a bit younger I always asked my father and Soumaya if they were going to have  a baby, and they said they would like to. I still felt surprised when it was actually confirmed. It was that warm feeling that would envelop me when a good change happened in my life.  I had no idea what it would be like, but I welcomed it.       My step -grandmother Khadija came to stay with us for a second time, mainly to help Soumaya prepare for the birth.        In the middle of the summer, mother took me and my sister on a vacation to Malaysia. This was the first time we ",1
"42","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","would go on an over seas vacation with just mother, and I was pleased at the thought of it. We took off on my 13th Birthday.  I spent my birthday on the airplane, a much more exciting birthday than the previous few. We traveled on Singapore Airlines, and though we weren’t trav eling first class on this trip, I found it to be just as comfortable. The staff of Singapore Airlines knew it was my birthday, and they brought me a cake with a candle during the middle of the flight. It was a very nice gesture.       We had to spend eight hours at the Singapore Airport. I thought this airport was such a pleasant place that I really enjoyed just spending time there. It was all part of the vacation experience. The airport was huge, and much more entertaining than LAX or any airport in Europe that I’ve been to. The three of us [36]walked around and explored, went shopping, visited all the common areas, and had a nice meal at one of the restaurants. There were a lot of foreign candies and sodas that I was curious to try. Traveling with just my mothe r and sister was a lot less stressful than traveling with father and Soumaya. It was wonderful.       When we arrived in Malaysia, we met up with my grandma Ah Mah , my mother’s sister Min and her husband Jack, and cousin Emma. They were also visiting Malaysia from England. We all stayed at a tall hotel building near the beach. After we unpacked everything at the hotel, some of my mother’s relatives who lived in Mala ysia came to see us. We had a birthday celebration for me at the hotel that night. Before I went to sleep, I pondered over the fact that I was now a teenager.       I had a lovely time on this vacation. Our hotel suite was on one of the highest floors of th e building, and it had an exquisite deck that provided a view of the ocean. During the trip, we toured around the island of Penang, visited Georgetown, went to a fun waterpark, and had very delicious meals at many exotic restaurants. Just relaxing and watc hing movies at the hotel was a joy in itself. The vacation was so nice that I didn’t even miss my life at home. The three weeks flew by very fast, and I cried a little when it was over. It was a good sadness.        I celebrated my birthday again at father’ s house on the night we returned to America. I was allowed to have my very first glass of beer for this celebration. I always thought of alcoholic drinks, such as beer and wine, as mysterious drinks that were forbidden to children like myself. Father would  let me have only a small sip of wine from time to time. Having my first glass of beer felt like a big honor.       For my present, I got my first cell phone. During this era, cell phones were like a rite of passage for kids my age. I always envied the kid s who had a cell phone. John Jo had a silver Sprint phone with green lighting that I always coveted. To finally have a cell phone of my own made me feel so proud. My phone was a silver T -Mobile phone with blue lighting. I loved the satisfaction I felt when  I opened it up and saw the pretty lights.   13 Years Old        I enjoyed the rest of the summer as best as I could. On the first Planet Cyber session after being back from vacation, I met up with John J o. They had the new Warcraft 3  expansion available to  play, and the two of us tried it out.       I had a sleepover with Charlie and Elijah, and they introduced me to their friend Julian Ritz -Barr. Julian went to Topanga Elementary with us, though he was two grades lower, so I never knew him beforehand. I thought he was very cool,  but a bit stupid. W e competed with each other at Planet Cyber. I continued to see him with Charlie and Elijah a few more times after that.            Coincidentally, Julian’s parents were friends with Rob Lemelson, and I didn’t know  this at the time. A few years down the line, I would cross paths with Julian again at one of the Lemelson’s parties, where I would spitefully envy him for being so confident with everyone.        When the summer ended, I cried a little. It was such a great  summer. I went on a vacation, I saw lots of friends, played lots of games, and enjoyed life to its fullest. Of course, I didn’t know at the time that this was the last good summer in my life, but I still cried… as I always do after a joyful experience com es to an end.        Eighth Grade began on a very mellow note. F or the first couple of months , I continued on with the life I’ve been living, and things seemed ok. The main people I hung out with at school were Al fred Graham, Gavin Dowd, and Bri ce Miller. Alfred was just getting good at skateboarding, and he was starting to become popular with the skateboarders. He once brought his skateboard to school and landed a kickflip, [37]the move I was never able to master in the past. I was secretly jealous,  even though I insisted to everyone that I was no longer interested in skateboarding.       I started to take more notice of the kids in lower grades, specifically the Seventh Graders. There was one who came in from Topanga Elementary, the older brother of one of Georgia’s friends. His name was Neil Davis. I observed the popular kids of Seventh Grade... In a way they visually mimicked the popular kids of my own  grade. They were all the same, though the Seventh Graders seemed a lot meaner. I noticed that Neil  Davis was starting to be friends with them, even with the pretty girls. I would gradually develop a great envy towards him.  Another one was Lucky Radley, the  black  kid I played with in father’s neighborhood . He transferred to Pinecrest during  that very ye ar, and he immediately became popular with the pretty girls of his grade. I hated him for it.       Things were getting more intense every year we grew older, and I didn’t want to grow up. I wanted to live the life I was comfortable with. I wanted to live i n a world of fairness, and I tried not to accept that it would soon come to an end.        The games I enjoyed playing at Planet Cyber were too powerful to run on my mother’s computer, so Planet Cyber was the only place I could play them. That was until I a sked my father to buy me Warcraft 3 to install on his powerful laptop. I got the Frozen Throne expansion to go with it, and once it was installed I was able to play it on his laptop when ever  he allowed me to. I thought it was really cool to actually play a n online game from my own home. Father’s house became a lot more fun after this, though I hated it when Soumaya set limits on my playtime.       When father invited the Bubenheims over, Alex sometimes brought his friends Gary and Antje Twinn. They had a so n named Vincent, who was the same age as my sister and a good friend of Lukas. Vincent was a kind -hearted and sweet little boy who was a bit overw eight. I showed him Warcraft 3  on my father’s computer. He was very interested in the game, and he would watch  me for hours. He really looked up to me. We got along well.       One day, I was looking up things on  the internet about Warcraft 3 . That is when I found out about a new, revolutionary Warcraft game coming out, called World of Warcraft. I didn’t think much  of it at the time, ignorant of the effect it would have on me in my later life.        Gradually, my friendship with Joh n Jo, Charlie, and Elijah started  to wane. They no longer ca me over as a group anymore. Our usual Friday sleepovers stop ped happenin g, as they go t more busy with other things. John Jo and Charlie slowly start ed to get bored o f Planet Cyber, which caused  them to lose their interest in coming over every week. I continue d to see them individually; sometimes I would see Charlie and Elijah together, sometimes just Elijah, and sometimes just John Jo.       Due to them coming over less often, I began to walk to Planet Cyber alone. I never did this before, because my friends cam e over so much and we would go together. I would usually play Diablo 2 or Warcraft 3 there. For a time, I did this as a routine without getting bored. Sometimes I would meet John Jo there and we would have intense Warcraft 3 competitions with each other.       After a few more weeks into autumn, I began to get a bit depressed over the fact that the good times I had with my main group of friends was fading away. I started to walk to Planet Cyber alone just to reminisce such times. Sometimes I would stay there  for hours into the night. I never thought I would get bored of the highly entertaining games there, but after playing them so much on my own, I was surprised that I was getting a bit bored. Good times always come to an end, and I always had a hard time ac cepting this fact.        One time while I was alone at Planet Cyber, I saw an older teenager watching pornography. I saw in detail a video of a man having sex with a hot girl. The video showed him stick his penis inside a girl’s vagina. I didn’t know anyth ing about sex at the time. I barely even knew what sex was. I was slowly [38]starting to develop sexual feelings for hot girls, but I didn’t know what to do with them. To see this video really traumatized me. I had no idea ",1
"43","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","what I was seeing… I could n’t imagine  human beings doing such things with each other. The sight was shocking, traumatizing, and arousing. All of these feelings mixed together took a great toll on me. I walked home and cried by myself for a bit. I felt too guilty about what I saw to talk to my  parents  about it. I was quite shaken for a few days.       This was among the very first glimpses I had of sex. Finding out about sex is one of the things that truly destroyed my entire life. Sex… the very word fills me with hate. Once I hit puberty, I wou ld always want it, like any other boy. I would always hunger for it, I would always covet it, I would always fantasize about it. But I would never get it. Not getting any sex is what will shape the very foundation of my miserable youth. This was a very dar k day.       Soon enough, I would inevitably  find out about what sex was, whether I saw that foul video or not. Boys at my school started talking about it. Connor Hanrahan and his friend Jordan Carlton one day told me exactly what happens when a man and a woman have sex. Finding out about sex was just the beginning of my horrific downfall.        My father and mother arranged to change our routine back to one -week, one -week. Father wanted to spend more time with us, and it was agreed that this would be the way. I was angry about this, because I felt satisfied with the way things were. If it we nt back to one -week, one -week, I would have to spend time at father’s even if father wasn’t there, and I hated that. I didn’t see how it enabled father to spend more time with us, because he was always going away for work anyway. But alas, I had no choice in the matter, and the arrangement was set. This is how it would remain from that point on... My living arrangement wouldn’t change again until I turn 18 and Soumaya kicks me out.        When Christmas came, I told father that I would like a new computer ga me. Father took me out shopping for my new present. We first went to Comp USA on Victory Boulevard, but they didn’t have a large selection of games. I was on the verge of just choosing to buy Diablo 2, a game I had already spent hours on at Planet Cyber. B ut then, I decided that since Best Buy was just across the street, we should go and have a look at the games there.       At Best Buy, I saw the game World of Warcraft. It had just come out a few weeks ago. I picked up the box and looked at it for a few mi nutes. The game looked amazing and alluring, so I decided to choose World of Warcraft as my Christmas present. I spent more time looking it over and reading about it on the way home.       The only computer I could play World of Warcraft on was father’s la ptop, but father was always using his laptop for work. I had to wait a long time to get a chance to play it. Aft er reading the game manual, I got extremely excited to play it. It was a whole new type of game for me, an MMORPG that would enable me to make my own character  in a huge online fantasy world, and it was a world I was already familiar with through playing Warcraft 3. This game was a hundred times bigger than any game I’ve played in the past. The more I read about the game, the more anticipated I be came.       After almost a month went by after getting World of Warcraft, I was finally able to play it. I made a WoW account with my father, and then I created my first character, a night elf druid. It really blew my mind. My first experience with WoW was  like stepping into another world of excitement and adventure. It was a video game world, but they made it so realistic that it was like living another life, a more exciting life. My life was getting more and more depressing at that point, and WoW would fi ll in the void. It felt refreshing and relieving. I was only able to play it for a few hours for my first session. It was all I would think about when I wasn’t able to play it.        Mother didn’t have a good enough computer to run World of Warcraft, so I felt a bit frustrated because of that. I thought of how awesome it would be if Planet Cyber had the game, but I doubted that [39]it did. One afternoon, I walked to Planet Cyber with my WoW disks and asked them if they can install my disks onto one of their com puters. The owner told me the game was already being installed, and I was thrilled to hear those words. It wasn’t ready yet, however, and I had to wait. I kept going back to Planet Cyber every day to wait for it, and played other games there while they wer e still processing it. It was a fun wait, and I knew I will eventually be able to play it. Finally, after spending three days at Planet Cyber waiting, it was ready. I loaded the game and logged onto my account. I was completely ecstatic. I spent all of my free time in the next few days playing it. The owner of Planet Cyber came to know me because of this series of events, and he named me his best customer.        I invited Charlie ove r, and he came with Stephen, an  old friend from Topanga Elementary whom I hadn’t seen for a while. I found out that they both had their own WoW accounts, and we went to Planet Cyber to play it together. I made a new character on their server just to play with them, though I would eventually discard this character.       I saw Char lie only a few more times after that. Elijah was busy with some life problems and stopped coming over. John Jo simply vanished from my life  at this point, for no particular reason.  I can’t recall the exact last time I saw him, but it was around this period .       My mother decided  to move to an apartment in Woodland Hills. I reacted indignantly. An apartment! I had never lived in an apartment before, and I always thought of apartments as being poor and low -class. I would be embarrassed to admit it to anyone.       The apartment building was called the Renaissance Apartments, near the Warner Center area of Woodland Hills. We moved into a two bedroom apartment. Mother knew I was too old to share a room with my sister , so she gave me the second bedroom, and she and my sister shared the master bedroom.       Leaving the blue house on Glade Avenue was hard. I had so many good times with my friends there. And to move out of it at the very time that I stopped seeing those f riends… it was quite emotional. I cried on our last day there.       My mother’s new apartment was not walking distance from Planet Cyber, and I was a bit embarrassed to show that I lived in an apartment, so I stopped seeing any friends. Elijah was the last  person in the group who I saw. I was at Planet Cyber and he tapped me on the shoulder. It was a random meeting. The two of us talked for a bit about the new Halo 2 game, and I showed him my WoW character. That was the last time I saw him.       Eventually,  I lost all contact with Charlie, John Jo, and Elijah. The friends I had such a good time s with for the last two years were no longer my friends. They were lost to me. I also stopped seeing Philip and Jeffrey … they simply just forgot about me, I assumed. T he only friend who remained to me was James Ellis.       The upside of moving to the apartment was that my mother acquired high speed internet. I was able to play World of Warcraft on her computer, along with Halo 2 on Xbox Live.       This was the point wh en my social life ended completely. I would never have a satisfying social life ever again. It was the beginning of a very lonely period of my life, in which my only social interactions would be online through video games, with the sole exception being my friendship with James. The ability to play video games with people online temporarily filled in the social void. I got caught up in it, and I was too young and naïve to realize the severity of how far I had fallen. I was too scared to accept it. This loss of a social life, coupled with the advent of puberty, caused me to die a little inside. It was too much for me to handle, and I stopped caring about my life  and my future . I even stopped caring about what people thought of me. I hid myself away in the onli ne World of Warcraft, a place where I felt comfortable and secure.   Part 4  [40]Stuck in the Void  Age 13 -17       James Ellis also acquired Xbox Live with Halo 2. I started to play it with him online, and our friendship reignited after being stale for the previ ous year. We would meet up online after school, or on Saturday mornings. The two of us battled on Halo 2 over the internet, just like we did with our Nintendo 64 games when we were children.       James would be my only friend throughout the next depressin g and lonely period of my life. My friendship with James helped me cope with the loneliness. The very few fun times we would have were  like a light in the darkness for me.        Now that I was able to play World of Warcraft at my mother’s house with no limitations, aside from school and homework, I became very addicted to the game and my character in it. It was all I cared about.       I was so immersed in the game that I no longer cared about what people thought of me. I only ",1
"44","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","saw school as something that took time away from WoW. I became very bored at school, mainly due to the fact that I was still the invisible quiet kid. To allev iate this boredom, I started to act weird and annoying to people just to gain attention.       I became known as the “weird kid” at Pinecrest, and people started to make fun of me, but I didn’t care. I had my online games to distract me from the harsh real ities of life that I was too scared to face. The only time I did care was when a group of popular Seventh Grade girls started teasing me, which hurt a lot. One of these girls was Monette Moio, a pretty blonde girl who was Ashton’s younger sister . She must have thought I was an ultimate loser. I hated her so much, and I will never forget her. I started to hate all girls because of this. I saw them as mean, cruel, and heartless creatures that took pleasure from my suffering.        At father’s house, I was for ced to change my bedroom to the downstairs room that Tracy once occupied. My old bedroom was to  be given to my baby brother… Soumaya was due to give birth to him very soon. I was quite annoyed at this. That room was the room that made me so enthusiastic ab out moving to that house. Father and Soumaya thought moving me was the best solution. The new baby would get a room close to them, and I would have the much bigger downstairs room.       When I moved to the downstairs room, I slowly agreed that it was the s ensible thing to do. My new room was twice the size of my old one, I still had my own bathroom, and I also had the hallway that led to it. Technically, I had the whole bottom floor of the three story house to myself. The only bad thing about this was that I would get scared to walk down those stairs at night when it’s dark… the light switch was at the bottom of the stairs. I’ve always been afraid of the dark.        Soumaya gave birth t o a newborn baby boy, and they named him Jazz. It happened during father’ s week. While father and Soumaya were at the hospital, Alex Bubenheim picked us up from school and we stayed at his house in the afternoons. This occurred for three days, and finally, on the day of the birth, father showed up to announce the birth of Jazz.  We had a little celebration, and the song “Jessie’s Girl” played from Alex’s sound system. Whenever I heard that song in the future, I would always think of t hat day.       It was an exciting day. I actually had a brother… It was hard to believe.  Technica lly he is my half -brother, but I would always term him as my brother. I wasn’t as impacted by his birth as I expected myself to be, possibly because I was so caught up in my own personal and emotional changes that I was going through at that stage.   [41]     Spring break came  up, the first break from school since I started playing WoW. I considered myself extremely fortunate that I was at my mother’s house for that week. I disliked being at father’s house, because I had so many limits on the amount of time I co uld play my game. On the onset of spring break, I planned to spend the whole time on WoW, leveling up my character and forgetting about my horrible school life.       I invited James to come over to my mother’s apartment for the first time. We played a roun d of Halo 2, and then I decided to show him World of Warcraft. He knew nothing about it. I was very eager to get him into it. WoW was his kind of game, after all. He seemed very interested.        We went to father’ s house for  Easter Sunday. He took us to a party held by some n ew friends of his, the Thompsons. Alongside the Bubenheims, the Thompso ns became frequent guests at my father’s dinner parties. They consisted of John Thompson, a successful film producer, and his wife Tatiana. They had three children: Isabella, the oldest daughter, was two years younger than me, and the twins Josh and Alessandra were the same age as my sister.       On the first day me and my sister met them, and I believe it was on that Easter Sunday, we played with them splendidly in their backyard. But soon, after they came over a few more times, I began to have uneasy feelings of nervousness and fear around the two girls, mainly because I thought all girls hated me. The way I w as treated by girls at my school played a big part in my resentment towards all of them during this time. This resentment would only grow larger the more I am treated unfairly by the female gender .       Mother took us to the premiere of Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith. As a huge Star Wars fan, this was a big day for me. Episode 3 would complete the whole Star Wars saga. It was the most anticipated movie.  To be able to see it before everyone else made me feel special. I really liked the character A nakin Skywalker, and I was amazed to see his epic transformation into Darth Vader on the high quality big screen.       Finally having something to brag about, I told everyone at school the next day that I went to the premiere because my mother is friends with George Lucas. The problem was that most Eighth Graders  thought of Star Wars as being a “nerdy”  interest , and they didn’t really care. I was left fr ustrated and disappointed by their reaction.        As middle school approached its ultimate end, I was h aving a miserable time there. I was extremely unpopular, widely disliked, and viewed  as the weirdest kid in the school. I had to act weird in order to gain attention. I was tired of being the invisible shy kid. Infamy is better than total obscurity.       The teasing I received was bittersweet. It felt horrible to be teased and bullied… it caused me a lot of pain and anger… but at the same time I got a kick out of getting so much attention. It felt good to be confident enough to pick fights with the popular skateboarder kids. It was either that, or continue to be  ignored by everyone like I was in Sixth and Seventh Grade. I never knew how to gain positive attention, only negative.      My experience during Middle School really darkened my view of the world, an d it would only get darker from then on, as I suffered more and more. The way I was treated by girls at this time, especially by that evil bitch Monette Moio, sparked an intense fear of girls. The funny part of this is that I ha d a secret crush on Monette.  She was the first girl I ever had a crush on, and I never admitted it to anyone. To be teased and ridiculed by the girl I had a crush on wounded me deeply. The world that I grew up thinking was bright and blissful was all over. I was living in a depraved world, and I didn’t want to accept it. I didn’t want to give any thought to it. That is why I immersed myself entirely into my online games like World of Warcraft. I felt safe there.   [42]     I was so obsessed with playing WoW that I never gave much serious t hought to the fact that I would have to go to High School soon. As the end of middle school neared, the prospect started to loom over me more and more. At one moment I pictured what my life in high school would be like, based on how things have been for me  in middle school. It was not a bright picture. I didn’t want to have to deal with the cruelty of girls in high school, and I imagined that it would be much worse than anything I’ve ever experienced. I begged my parents to send me to Crespi Carmelite High School, a catholic all -boys school.       Father took me there for a tour, and it didn’t look so bad. It was a very prestigious private school. At least I wouldn’t have to deal with any fear of girls there. We submitted an application. A few weeks later I received the news tha t I had been accepted to Crespi.        Eighth Grade Graduation was a nightmare. Everyone was required to go up on stage and speak to the whole audience. We had to say our name, and tell everyone what school we were planning on going to . The audience consisted of all of the student’s families, as well as any siblings or friends who wished to attend. Both of my parents came, as well as Soumaya, Khadija, my sister, and even my baby  brother  Jazz.       It took place in the evening. As I lined up, I could feel myself shaking. I was scared even to speak in front of a classroom. To speak in a microphone to hundreds of people was too much. I didn’t understand how everyone else seemed to be fine with it.  I envied their bravery. When my name was called, I didn’t want to go, but it was required of me, and I pushed myself to do it. I walked up to the microphone and nervously said “My name is Elliot, and I plan on going to Crespi High School”. I heard my own voice in the speakers and saw everyone staring at me. It made me cringe. I quickly walked away for the next person to go up. It was over . Eighth Grade was over . Middle School was over .      I said a few farewells to the people I knew. Alfred Graham and Bri ce Miller told me they were going to Crespi as well. At least I will know two people at Crespi on the first day, I thought.  The thought of going to High S chool sent a shiver through me. I put it in the back of my mind to deal with later.       After the ceremony, I said ",1
"45","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","goodbye to the principal, and she congratulated me on completing middle school. On the way home, my family seemed very proud of me. I didn’t feel proud. I didn’t feel like I accomplished anything. Middle School, though it started out ok in the first two years, ended up being a disaster.        For the summer break, I planned on spending the whole time playing WoW and forgetting about everything else. I reached the highest level on my WoW character: level 60. I actually conside red this to be a huge and important accomplishment. I joined a guild with my character, and I made a few online friends though it. I couldn’t wait to play my character further, exploring everything the game had to offer and collecting more armor pieces  and trinkets .       In just a week into my summer break, my mother told me that father and Soumaya were going to Morocco, and I would be forced to go with them. This news upset me tremendously. I then asked how long this trip would be, and I was told it would  be eight weeks . EIGHT WEEKS?! I could not believe what I was hearing. I threw a big tantrum.       For one thing, I was never enthusiastic about Morocco. The country is very backwards, and that made me very uncomfortable. They didn’t even have the latest v ideo games. And to be forced to go there for eight weeks? That would take up the entire summer and the first two weeks of  high  school. It was even longer than the last time we went, and I thought that was too long. I wouldn’t be able to play WoW at all for two whole months. The prospect devastated me.  I begged my mother to not let me go, but father and Soumaya insisted on bringing me and Georgia , and my mother was probably looking forward to having two months without children to look after.  The decision was  made, the plans were set. They [43]already had a plane ticket ready for me. I was going to Morocco. I bet they all knew I would protest against going, which is why they told me last minute.       The last day of mother’s week was the day before we would depart . Mother took me and my sister to a barbeque  at the  house  of her friends Alan and Rebecca . I was very sad for the whole day. I didn’t do anything at the barbeque except swing on their swing in misery. When we got home I played WoW for the very last time. I took advantage of the few hours I had left on it. My mother allowed me to stay up until midnight playing. I acquired a very nice piece of armor for my character. I didn’t want to leave it.       When we arrived at father’s house the next day, I heard even more upsetting news. Father had to work for the first few weeks of summer, so he would joining us in the middle of the trip. It was only Soumaya taking us to Morocco! I always hated traveling with Soumaya. She made everything so difficult. Baby Jazz will b e coming along with us, of course, and the stress of looking after a whelping baby while traveling will put Soumaya in a bad mood. I was not happy at all.       As I expected, the journey there was a disaster. Baby Jazz cried a lot during the trip, and Soumaya wasn’t at her best of moods. We didn’t take First Class, and we had to make three stops; once in Michigan, again in Paris, and yet again in Casablanca, before taking a small plane to Tangier. It was a miserable journey, the complete opposite of the  great time I had a year ago on the trip to Malaysia.       We took a taxi to Khadija’s house right after we arrived. Khadija went home to Morocco on a different plane a few days before us, and she was already settled in. After unpacking at Khadija’s house,  we walked to Soumaya’s father’s huge house where I met Ayman again. I remembered playing with Ayman on my last trip to Morocco… He grew up a lot  since then . To my dismay, he was taller and stronger than me, despite being two years younger. I was always sh ort and physically weak… that’s how it’s been all my life. We instantly became friends again after catching up a little, and I played hide -and-seek  tag with him and his two younger brothers.       I disliked having to be in Morocco for the whole summer, but  I tried to make the best of it. Ayman made the time I spent there more fun. We often went out by ourselves to explore  the city of Tangier. Ayman knew where everything was, and Soumaya trusted him to show me around. Georgia sometimes came with us. We had a  few good times together, and we got along well.        The Thompson s joined us in Morocco a couple of weeks after we arrived. Georgia was happy that Alessandra, Josh, and Isabella were there to play with her. I was not happy about it. I was so scared of girls at th at time that I kept my distance from Alessandra and Isabella. I didn’t want to admit to Ayman that I was scared of girls though, that would have been embarrassing, so I just told him that I thought they were too immature. He didn’t understand this , because I myself was very immature at the time.       For my 14th birthday, Soumaya organized a small party at her father’s house. Most of the guests were her Moroccan friends, and some of them didn’t even know that the party was for my birthday. I was a bit annoyed by this. They had a cake arranged for me, and when it was brought out everyone gathered to wish me a happy birthday. Th at would be the last time I spent my birthday with more people than just my family. I was amazed that I was actually fourteen . Fourteen sounded like such a big number. I didn’t feel fourteen. I still felt like a kid, and in all appearances, I was.       Father couldn’t even make it for my birthday. I was a bit upset about this. He came a few days after it. Once he arrived, we toured around Tangier and a few other areas as a family. Khadija and Ayman sometimes came along with us. Soumaya’s father owned a house on the beach, and we usually went there for beach trips. I caught a virus while swimming in the ocean once, which caused me  to get extremely ill. I spent a whole week of the vacation in bed, aching and vomiting. I was never th at ill before in my life. Whenever I would think about Morocco in the future, I thought about that horrid experience.       At one time towards the end of  the trip, when I had a sleepover with Ayman at Soumaya’s father’s house, he showed me some European porn videos in the middle of the night. I could observe the act of sex in much more detail than that one glimpse I had at Planet Cyber. I didn’t want to lo ok, but my [44]curiosity got the better of me. To see a video of human beings doing such weird and unspeakable things with each other revolted me. I couldn’t understand what I was seeing. And yet, I noticed I was feeling aroused. I felt desire to do those thin gs, to h ave sex with the naked women  I saw in the video. It was a funny feeling that overwhelmed my whole body. I could feel my penis getting hard. This is when I noticed that I was finally going through puberty.  Heavens save me .      The trip was way too long, and towards the end I felt depressed and homesick. All I wanted was to go back home and play WoW, and yet I had to accept that once I did get home, I had to start high school right away. I supposed that being able to play Wo W again would make up for that, though. And it would sure beat staying in Morocco for any longer. I was growing tired of it.   14 Years Old        I felt a wave of relief when we arrived back in the United States. We had to travel separately from father agai n because he had a different flight schedule, but it wasn’t that bad on the way back because I was looking forward to playing WoW again.       I only had one free day before I had to start school. When I got back to mother’s house, I gave her a big hug… Tha t was the longest time I had been away from mother. After that, I immediately asked if I can go on her computer and play my game. I logged onto my character, which was just the way I left it two months ago. I said hi to all of my online friends and tried t o catch up on everything.        The dread ed day arrived all too soon. I had to start High School. School had already begun while I was still in Morocco, so I would be the “new kid”  again . That made it so much worse. My father drove me there on the first da y. When we got there, I was intimidated by all the huge high school boys, and I cried in the car for a few minutes, telling my father that I was too scared to get out.       I had to go, and eventually I did. We walked to the main office where I ran into B rice Miller. We greeted each other  before I was led up to join my first class of the day. Alfred Graham was in th at class, and he help ed me settle in.       During lunchtime, Alfred showed me around the whole school. I started to feel a lot more comfortabl e. He introduced me to some of the other freshmen. In the courtyard, I met Pascal and his clique of friends. I immediately took a disliking to them. Pascal was cocky and popular, so I felt intimidated.  He was like the Crespi equivalent of Robert Morgan.  As I met a few more p eople, I ran into Keaton  Webber!  I ",1
"46","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","didn’t expect to find any more people I knew at Crespi. It really took me by surprise. I hadn’t seen Keaton since he left Topanga Elementary at the end of Fourth Grade. Keaton was still the arrogant jerk he always was at Topanga, and he had his own clique of skateboarder friends, such as Andy Moussa and Aaron Amman.       As I expected, I failed to make any new friends. I was so overwhelmed by the brutality of the world that I just didn’t care anymore . On the very first week, I had my first experience of true bullying, not just the teasing I had at Pinecrest. Some horrible Twelfth Graders saw me as a target because I looked like a ten year old and I was physically weak. They threw food at me during lun chtime and after school.  It enraged me, but I was too scared to do anything about it. What kind of horrible, depraved people would poke fun at a boy younger than them who has just entered high school?  I thought to myself.        After the first few weeks o f high school, I concluded that my time at Crespi would not be pleasant at all. I withdrew further into the World of Warcraft, neglecting my homework and spending all of my free time playing it.       As a late birthday present, father bought me a new laptop that was able to run WoW. It wasn’t a very powerful laptop, but it performed adequately. This enabled me to have more time playing my game. During father’s week, Soumaya was always on my back a bout how much time I spent on WoW, but since [45]my room was on the bottom floor, secluded from the rest of the house, I was able to sneak as much time on it as I could.       While I was playing WoW after dinner at mother’s house once, I heard my sister watch ing the new show Avatar: The Last Airbender on the television.  I decided to check it out. I soon found myself really enjoying it. It was a magnificent story set in a fantasy world where people can control the power of the elements. Once I watched the firs t episode, I was hooked on the story. Prince Zuko was my favorite character; he was a banished prince who was trying to regain his rightful place in the world. I always related to him. Avatar: The Last Airbender became my favorite T.V. show.        My mothe r informed  me that she was just on the phone to Arte Ellis, and he told her that James now played  World of Warcraft. I was very pleased to hear this. I could now share my greatest interest in the world with my good friend… my only friend. I then went over to James’s house  for a sleepover , which I hadn’ t done for a while. He showed me his WoW character, who was only level 20. We weren’t on the same server, so we couldn’t play it together. The only way would be for one of us to start over, and we were too imm ersed in our characters to do that. I was fine with that. James was really fascinated by my level 60 character, and most of the time he would just watch me play, anyway.  We also played a lot of Halo 2 together.       Having these common interests with James  reminded me of the good  old days when we were children;  when we were both interested in skateboarding, and before that, Pokemon. This nostalgic experience provided a small respite from my sufferings at school.        My life at Crespi  got even worse. Alfred and Brice apparently told everyone how weird I was at Pinecrest, and people in my own grade started to tease me. They found out that I didn’t like being called a skateboarder, and it was true. Because I failed to become good at skat eboarding, I developed a hatred for the sport, and whenever someone called me a skateboarder, it reminded me of my failure and I got very angry. The whole school started calling me it just to anger me, along with other insulting names. They teased me becau se I was scared of girls, calling me names like “fag got”. People also liked to steal my belongings and run away in an attempt to get me to chase after them. And I did chase after them in a furious rage, but I was so little and weak that they thought it was  comical. I hated everyone at that school so much.      It got to a point where I had to wait in a quiet corner for the hallways to clear before I could walk to class. I also took long routes around the school to avoid bullies. My parents began to consider not letting me continue there after Ninth Grade.        When winter break came, I felt like I had just landed on a peaceful island after swimming through a horrific storm. It was such a fine relief. The break was to last for three weeks, and I was sorely disappointed that two of them would be at father’s house, while only one was at mother’s. I hated being at father’s house because Soumaya became more and more suspicious of how much time I spent playing WoW, and she would place limits on my playtime whenever  she caught me playing it. I wasn’t able to do my five -hour -long events to collect rare armor pieces for my character while I was at father’s house.       It was during this winter break that I experienced my first masturbation and ejaculation. It was one o f the most peculiar and memorable experiences of my life. At this point I was officially going through the stages of puberty, and I had lots of sexual urges. I often fantasized about hot naked girls while rubbing my penis against my mattress at night. One time, while doing this, I felt an intense stirring numbness all around my fully erect penis, and it extended all over my body. It felt magical and ecstatic, and I kept rubbing my penis on the mattress. That was when the orgasm happened. I couldn’t believe how much pleasure I felt from that. I looked down at  my peni s to see that my semen had poured out all over it, like [46]a volcanic eruption of white, sticky fluid.  What was happening to me?  I thought to myself with nervous excitement. It was like nothing I had  ever seen or experienced before, something completely out of my world. I felt really guilty afterwards, so I refrained from telling anyone about it.        I started to masturbate on a regular basis. At first I only did it by rubbing my penis on my bed, bu t it eventually escalated to looking at pictures of girls online while rubbing my penis against my pants, fantasizing about doing sexual things with them. I didn’t know how to access any porn sites, so I would just browse regular websites until I found a p icture of a hot girl to masturbate to.        I developed a very high sex drive, and it would always remain like this. This was the start of hell for me. Going through puberty utterly doomed my existence. It condemned me to live a life of suffering and unfu lfilled desires.  Even at that young age, I felt dep ressed because I wanted sex, yet  I felt unworthy of it. I didn’t think I was ever going to experience sex in reality, and I was right. I never did.  I was finally interested in girls, but there was no way I  could ever get them . And so my starvation began.         The boys in my grade talked about sex a lot. Some of them even told me that they had sex with their girlfriends. This was the most devastating and traumatizing thing I’ve ever heard in my life. Boys having sex at my age of Fourteen? I couldn’t fathom it. How is it that they were able to have such intimate and pleasurable experiences with girls while I could only fantasize about it?  I frequently started asking myself. This was an all -boys school… How in the hell were those boys even able to meet girls to have sex with? I wondered. I hoped they were lying. I hoped against all hope. Hearing that really shook me to the core. Words cannot describe how much hatred and envy I felt for those boys. That ha tred would only fester the more I suffer from my sexual starvation. I was too scared to tell anyone about it, and I hid it well… for a time.        These recent events cause me to withdraw even further away from the world. I drowned all of my misery in my o nline games. World of Warcraft was the only thing I had left to live for. My grades at Crespi dropped dramatically. I just didn’t care anymore. I hated that school. I didn’t think about my future. The only thing I gave any serious thought to was my WoW cha racter. I had become very powerful in the game, and I was in one of the best guilds. With this guild, I participated in lots of five -hour raid events to collect better gear and armor for my character.        Mother moved  to a new house with a swimming pool that she was able to lease for a fair price. She picked me and my sister up from father’s house and took us there as a surprise. It was located near the old blue house, though in a nicer area. This was on a day that I had an  event on WoW in the afternoon, and I was very concerned about whether or not I would make it in time, so when we got to the new house I didn’t even look around and immediately hooked up my laptop to play WoW. I was that  obsessed.         After being bullied so much in Eighth and Ninth Gr ade, I became more shy and timid than I ever was in my life. I felt very small, weak, and above all, worthless. I cried by myself at school every day.       The very last day of Ninth Grade ",1
"47","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","was the worst. I was having P.E. at the gym, and one of my obnoxio us classmates named Jesse was bragging about having sex with his girlfriend. I defiantly told him that I didn’t believe him, so he played a voice recording of what sounded like him and his girlfriend having sex. I could hear a girl saying his name over and  over again while she panted franticly. He grinned at me smugly. I felt so inferior to him, and I hated him. It was at that moment that I was called to the office. When I got there, my mother was waiting for me to take me home. I cried heavily as I told he r about what happened earlier. That was the last day I ever set foot in Crespi Carmelite High School.       Crespi was finished. I thought I could finally relax. Little did I know that the worst was yet to come.  [47]      My parents shock ed me with very horribl e news. They were planning on sending me to Taft High School.  Taft had  five times as many students as Crespi, it was a public school, it had girls in it, and it had a bad reputation. I had never been so scared in my entire life.  How could they do this to m e, after knowing what I went through at Crespi? Taft High School would eat me alive and spit me out. I felt so betrayed by my parents.       On top of that, they told me I had to go to summer school at Taft very soon. I failed a few classes at Crespi  and I had to make up for them. The summer was supposed to be a time of peace and relaxation. This was turning out to be the worst summer of my life.       I went with my parents to the Taft Orientation event, and it was a horrific experience. I felt so dismayed at how large the school was, and how intimidating all of the tall students were. I even begged my parents to send me back to Crespi, because I knew Taft would be much worse.        I had a foul time at summer school. I remember how I used to hate it when my parents made me go to summer camp. Summer camp was like heaven compared to summer school at Taft. I got lost on the first day. I was so terrified that I hid in the hallways d uring break time. I spent my time at summer school gruelingly waiting to go home so I could feel safe playing WoW.       My 15th Birthday was in the midst of this summer school term. I was so miserable during this period that I didn’t even give much thought  to it. It was so uneventful that  I barely remember anything about it. I believe I just had dinner with my mother and played WoW afterwards.   15 Years Old        Toxic  is the word that describes my first day of Tenth Grade at Taft High School. It was a tox ic nightmare. Every single second of it was agony. I continued to beg my parents to not make me go, but it was to no avail. My father drove me there, and I didn’t want to get out of his car. He almost had to drag me out. I somehow found the will to put one  foot in front of the other and walk towards that awful, ugly front building.       The first week of Taft was living hell. I was bullied several times, even though I didn’t know anyone there. After being so used to wearing a polo shirt with khaki pants as  a school uniform at private schools, I continued to dress like that even after leaving Crespi. I didn’t give any thought to how nerdy I looked. I was too withdrawn, like a turtle tucked into his shell. I was still in the process of going through puberty a t the time, so I still looked and sounded like a ten -year- old. Such a persona attracted zero attention from girls, of course, but it did attract bullies like moths to a flame.      I was completely and utterly alone. No one knew me or extended a hand to he lp me. I was an innocent, scared little boy trapped in a jungle full of malicious predators, and I was shown no mercy. Some boys randomly pushed me against the lockers as they walked past me in the hall. One boy who was tall and had blonde hair called me a “loser ”, right in front of his girlfriends. Yes, he had girls with him. Pretty girls. And they didn’t seem to mind that he was such an evil bastard. In fact, I bet they liked him for it. This is how girls are, and I was starting to realize it. This was what trul y opened m y eyes to how brutal the world  is. The most meanest and depraved of men come out on top, and women flock to these men. Their evil acts are rewarded by women; while the good, decent men are laughed at. It is sick, twisted, and wrong in every way . I hated the girls even more than the bullies because of this. The sheer cruelty of the world around me was so intense that I will never recover from the mental scars. Any experience I ever had before never traumatized me as much as this.        I couldn’t d o it anymore. On the morning before the second week of Taft started, I broke down and cried in front of my mother, begging her not to make me go to that horrible place. I was so scared that I [48]felt physically sick. I continued crying in the car on the way t here, and my mother gave in. Instead of taking me to school, we went to the café at Gelson’s in Calabasas where we had a big talk. I tried to explain how much I was suffering there. She just could not take me to school after that. When we were finished wit h Gelsons’s, she drove me to my father’s house and told him about what happened. They agreed to take me out of Taft.       I didn’t go to school for a month while my parents decided what to do with me. I took advantage of the time to rest and recover at hom e, playing my online games. The pain and suffering I had to endure at Taft was all over, but the scars would remain. I tried to forget about it as much as I could. I took a deep breath and relaxed.        After a month of recovery, my parents took me to loo k at two continuation high schools, which operate like home -schooling because you only spend three hours a day there and do the rest of the work at home. One of them was right next to El Camino High School, the other one was in Van Nuys. My parents preferr ed the one in Van Nuys because they felt it was more structured  and organized . It was called Independence High School, and they decided to send me there.        Independence was a very small school with only three buildings and 100 students. The teachers we re all very nice and u nderstanding, and it had a relaxed and calm environment. I figured this was the best option for me.            A week later, I started going to Independence High School. I didn’t like any of the students there, as they were all slobs w ith the exception of two or three boys. This wasn’t a major concern, because I didn’t care about having a social life at the point. All I wanted to do was hide away from the cruel world by playing my online games, and Independence High School gave me the p erfect opportunity to do just that. I only had to be at school for three or four hours per day, and all of the work was very easy with teachers available to help me with anything. After those short school hours, I had all the time in the world to do whatev er I wa nted, and I spent it playing World of Warcraft .      One drawback was that I had to take the bus to school because my parents couldn’t pick me up at such an early time of the day. Though it was embarrassing, I didn’t care about appearances anymore, so I didn’t make a big deal out of it.       This was the perfect set up for a World of Warcraft addict. After school, every day, I fully indulged myself in my addiction to WoW. My only social interaction was with my online friends and with James, who would  occasionally come over to my house to play WoW with me.        My father’s car eer as a commercial director hadn’t  been as successful as it was a couple years before . He foolishly decided to invest all of his money in his first feature film, a documentary named “Oh My God”. In the film, he would interview various people about their opinions on religion and God. To make it, he took off to travel all over the world for a few months. Despite this, the one week -one week arrangement remained, and during father’s week I had to stay at father’s house with only Soumaya. This frustrated me tremendously, because Soumaya has always been a pain to live with, and she w ould  obstruct  my time on WoW. I was hopeful about father’s movie, however. He kept talking about how he will become very rich from it, and I fostered a hope that he would become rich. How naïve I was… the movie would only bankrupt him in the future.       On top of this, I had to deal with another change at father’s house that angered me to no end. I had to give up my lovely, huge, and luxurious downstairs room. It was all because baby Jazz got a new nanny. Once again, Jazz’s existe nce caused me to lose my room at father ’s house. This time, father made my room into his new office. He split his old office into two bedrooms, in which I got one of them and the nanny got the other. My new room was much smaller, and it didn’t have its own bathroom. My downstairs room was the b est part of being at father’s house, and it was all gone. I started to really hate going there.  [49]      Father came back shortly for the winter break, before taking off again. A new ",1
"48","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","expansion for World of Warcraft, called the Burning Crusade, came out in the  beginning of January. I was extremely excited for this expansion. It added many new features to the game, new areas to explore, and raised the level cap to 70. It was like a whole new WoW game. I asked my father to buy it for me as a Christmas present. I can still remember the intense anticipation I felt as I installed it onto my laptop.        I decided to transfer my WoW character to the same server as James, so that we could play together online and level up our characters in the new expansion. Through d oing this, I met two of James’s friends from his school, who also played on his server. They were two brothers named Steve and Mark. Steve is our age, and Mark is a couple years older.       Me, James, Steve, and Mark would then always play together online as a group. I found them quite fun to play the game with, and it was nice to have some friends to play WoW with on a regular basis. Eventually, Steve and Mark decided to make new characters on a PvP server, which had play settings that were more to my liki ng. I chose to make a new character with them. I made a blood elf character that I leveled up very fast, and this became my main character in the game. James stayed on hi s old server for a while, but within a few weeks we persuaded him to join us on the ne w one.        I had heated conflicts with Soumaya during every week that I was at father’s house. All I wanted to do was play WoW, and Soumaya strictly limited my playtime. Because my new room was just across from hers, she knew what I was doing at every si ngle second. She was breathing down my neck the whole time. She kept making me do chores around the house. I despised doing work around the house, especially since we had a nanny who was supposed to do it. If I made a scene about doing the work, she took a way my laptop for a day or two. This was the most horrible thing she could do to me, to take away my only source of joy left in the world. She sometimes did it even when father was at home, and father didn’t lift a finger to stop her.        My first year at Independence high school came to an end very quickly. Nothing eventful really happened there, and I barely interacted with anyone. I would just go there for my required time, do my work, and go home. I was too absorbed in my game to c are about anything else.        At father’s house, in the beginning of the summer, I was introduced to someone who I would hate for a very long time: Leo Bubenheim. Alex Bubenheim married a German woman named Karina who had just moved to the U.S. with her t wo kids: Leo and Pollina, who became Alex’s step -children. They would then always come over as a family. Leo was 12  years old, and Pollina was a year younger than me. My fear of girls made me keep my distance from Pollin a. She was a total bitch anyway, and  her attitude would only get worse. She is a true representative of everything I hate about women.       When I first met Leo, I didn’t think much of him. He was only twelve  years old. I just thought of him as Lukas’s new older brother. I had no inkling of how much I w ill envy and hate him later on.       Soon enough, my jealousy of Leo began to manifest. He had just moved to the U.S. from Germany, and yet he was already able to make lots of friends and had a great social life. He was tall, good looking, blonde -haired, and a skateboarder; the type of person I’ve always envied  and wanted to be .       Me, my father, and the Bubenheims all went on a camping trip to Big Bear. It wa s just the boys. We drove deep into the wilderness in my father’s big, formidable Lexus SUV. After setti ng up our tents, we built a nice fire to gather around and tell stories.  It was quite fun, and it made for a small respite from my lonely life, though I  had to suffer the presence of Leo and deal with my jealousy of him. One time [50]during the trip, my father made me take Leo and Lukas out exploring. The three of us covered a lot of ground, and I tried to act tough in front of them by slashing my knife at an y plant that got in our way.         The 4th of July of this year was the day I saved my little brother’s life from drowning. I went with my family to Antje and Gary Twinn’s house, as they always had a 4th of July party. The Bubenheims were there, including  Leo and Pollina. So was Vincent Twinn, who had grown up quite fast. The last time I saw him, he was the little kid who looked up to me when I showed him all of my computer games. Now he was just becoming a teenager, with an interest in skateboarding.       The party was a pool party, and my brother Jazz had full exposure to the swimming pool. He had already learned how to walk, but he couldn’t swim. At one instance as I was eating lunch, I saw Jazz quickly run off from the adults, completely unattended. I then watched as he curiously examined the water, and then descended into steps of the shallow end of the pool. Before long, he lost his footing on the steps and his whole body sank into the water. Nobody noticed. He was going to drown , I thought with panic . I ran as fast as I could, plunging into the water with my clothes still on, and pulled him out. I asked him how he was doing, and he coughed up some water and told me he felt fine. The only person who saw this happen was a little girl who was swimming in  the shallow end. I saved his life, and my brother remembers it to this very day. Every single second of my brother’s  life, everything that happens to him in the future, will exist because I pulled him out of the water that day.       I celebrated my 16th Birthday at mother’s house.  She bought me an Xbox 360, which had just been released . I didn’t play it yet though, because the only game I wa nted for it was Halo 3, which was  set to come out in November. I was really loo king forward to that game. It was  supposed to be the best Halo  game  of all time. After I blew out my candles, I remember going outside and sitting by my mother’s pool to contemplate my life. Sixteen… what an age to be. I still felt like I was twelve. Most teenagers will start driving at t his age… I couldn’t even fathom myself driving. The thought of it scared me.       James came for a sleepover shortly after my birthday, and he helped me set up my Xbox 360 . We played a round of Halo 2 to test it out. He didn’t bring his computer, because h e had a desktop that was hard to transport, so I suggested that we go to Planet Cyber to play WoW together. Our parents dropped us off there and we had a good WoW session. It was nice to see that place again, to reminisce of happier times. I proposed, for nostalgia’s sake, that we walk home for the way back. My mother’s new house was three times the distance from Planet Cyber as her old blue house, but I really wanted to do it. On the way, we passed by that little blue house, and all of the memories came ba ck. The two of us talked a lot, and shared some laughs. It was a very memorable night.   16 Years Old        As summer’s end drew closer, I became more and more depressed. My life had gotten so lonely, and playing WoW barely made up for it. My mother noticed  this and proposed that I get together with Philip again. She called Philip’s mother Kathy to arrange a meetup. And so Philip came over twice during that summer. I quite liked seeing him again… it was two years since the last time we spoke. Though he had no interest in my video games, he enjoyed playing in my mother’s swimming pool.       I had one playdate with Jeffrey as well. Philip and his family went on a vacation to Catalina, and Jeffrey wanted to stay at home. I went to his house for a sleepover with just him there.  Jeffrey had changed a lot. He was now Fourteen, and he told me he had a girlfriend. I was shocked, amazed, and envious. I wondered how an immature brat like Jeffrey could have a girlfriend at such a young age. I had the dreaded suspicion th at he had already had sex with her, and I tried not to think about it. I was deeply jealous, but for the sake of our past friendship and the good times we had together in the  past, I hid that envy well enough.  [51]      Eleventh Grade at Independence began. I still took the bus to school, as I had no desire to learn how to drive at that age. I was way too afraid of even trying it out. Driving is something that adults are supposed to do, and I still felt like a child.       I continued on with my lonely routine of doing my schoolwork in the morning and playing WoW with James, Steve, and Mark for the rest of the time. I gave no thought to my future at all. I just lived in the moment, in my comfort zone.       My sex drive was at its peak at this age. Whenever I go t back from school, I had to masturbate. The urge was too strong. During my masturbation sessions I often built elaborate fantasies in my mind that I had a hot, blonde -haired girlfriend to have passionate sex with; almost like having an imaginary girlfriend. I told no one about this. In fact, I didn’t talk to my ",1
"49","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","parents at all about my sexual development. I felt too guilty and embarrassed about it. Whenever they probed me, I lied to them, telling them that I had no sex drive.  My mother once caught me lookin g at pictures of girls online, and I franticly had to convince her that I stumbled on those pictures by accident.       I also noticed that my voice was getting deeper. I was starting to sound like an actual teenager. The last stages of puberty were over.        Halo 3 came out in November. I got my mother to buy it for me on the very day it was released. I had a lot of fun playing it while drinking the special mountain dew flavor that was released with the game; Mountain Dew Game Fuel, it was called. The ga me definitely lived up to its expectations, and to my surprise I found myself playing it more than WoW for the first couple of weeks.        Father suffered  through a deep financial setback because of his movie. Could things get any worse for me?  As a resul t, my father abruptly cut off all of the child -support payments he was paying my mother. My mother was forced to find a better -paying  job to make up for it, and she had to move out of her house to a condominium close by.       Thankfully, Rob Lemelson offer ed her a job in his production company, Elemental Productions. This new job enabled my mother to make enough money to live comfortably. We hadn’t seen the Lemelsons much  since the last time we went trick -or-treating with them years ago. It was good to reco nnect with them.       I missed mother living in an actual house, but at least the new place was a condominium, with more luxuries than the apartment we once lived in. The condominium had three bedrooms, and my room had its own bathroom. The bad part about this condominium was its location in Canoga Park, a lower -class area. I hated telling people that my mother lived in Canoga Park. It was highly embarrassing for me. But alas, in that lonely and depressing stage of my life, there was no one really to tell, and I barely cared about what people thought of me anyway.  I was a complete dork, stuck in my own little world.       An ex change student from France moved  into my father’s house. His name was Max Bonon , a cultured, outgoing nineteen -year -old French guy. His parents are very wealthy hotel owners, and he would be staying with us for a few months while he studies English at Pierce College. At first, I wasn’t so sure about having this young person lurking a bout, but we soon developed a good friendship. He always invited me to play cards with him after dinner, and though Soumaya didn’t let me drink alcohol, he would always sneak me a beer. It was really nice to have that regular social interaction. I became r eally fond of Max.       In just two weeks after Max arrived, we got the news that Soumaya’s father died in Moro cco. Soumaya immediately left  for Morroco, and she took baby Jazz with her. Though I was really sad about the death of Soumaya’s father , as he was a very kind  and generous  man, I was glad to see Soumaya [52]gone. Father’s whole household changed for the better. I started to love going to father’s house, especially with Max there.  He was like an older brother to me.        My mother bec ame  really close f riends with the Lemelson s due to her new job. Every year, they have an extravagant Christmas party at their newly built mansion in the Palisades, and we would now  be invited to it. James also went to the party, and I had a pleasant time hanging out with hi m and Noah.        During one week at father’s after the New Year, father had to leave for his work. For that week it was just me, my sister, and Max in the house. The three of us had a lot of fun together. Max took us to Universal Studios. Father allowed h im to drive the big Lexus, for which I was a bit jealous. The last time I was at the Universal Studios amusement park was when I just moved to America. Mother took us to the Universal city walk a couple of times, but never the amusement park. I went on all  of the rides, including the infamous Jurassic Park ride that I was rejected from going on when I was a child.       When father came back, we talked to him about our time a t Universal Studios. He suggested  that we all go to Six Flags. The four of us set ou t for it the next day. Six Flags was the biggest amusement park I’ve ever been to. I was awed by all the gigantic roller coaster rides. Max, my father, and even my little sister were all eager to tackle the largest roller coasters. I was the only one who w as scared out of my mind. Max talked me into it, so I nervously gave all of the rides a try, and ended up having some fun.        To my chagrin, m y father  decided to ta ke up motor cycle riding. He pulled up to the house one day in a roaring Harley Davidson, and I was completely baffled. I suppose it was due to some mid -life crisis he was going through. A motorc ycle… Really?  Alex Bubenheim  got him into it. He and Alex would then ride their motorcycles all the time. He kept insisting that he take me on the motorcycle whenever we went out, instead of going in the car. This would be too embarrassing for me, and I adamantly refused to ever go o n the motorcycle.        I went with mother to the red carpet premiere of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This was my fourth premiere. Going to premieres were always an uplifting experience for me. The movie was quite a disappointment, h owever, and I much preferred the classic Indiana Jones films. The next day, I told some of my teachers that I went to this premiere, and they were very shocked. I bet I was the first kid at that school who has done such  prestigious  things.        Soumaya an d Jazz returned from Morocco. I was happy to see my baby brother again, but not so happy to see Soumaya. Things were a lot better at father’s house when she was gone. Soon after she came back, we started getting into various arguments again, which embarras sed me in front of Max.        In the Spring, something horrible happened that will haunt me forever. We met up with the Bubenheims at the Sagebrush Cantina in Calabasas, and a friend of Pollina’s was there with them, named Nicole, a girl around my age . She sat next to Leo the whole time, and by the end of the dinner, the two of them were making out. Twelve -year- old Leo was making out with a girl who was almost my age. Not only does Leo have a better social life, but now he was making  out with girls, AT AGE TWELVE! They made out for a long time, and I could see them tongue kiss. They knew I was watching with envy, and they still did it. I bet that lucky bastard took great satisfaction from my envy.  There I was, watching a boy four years younger than me experi ence everything I’ve longed for… to kiss a girl… to be worthy of a girl’s attraction. On that day,  I developed a vicious hatred for Leo that will never go away.       A few days later, Max went home to France, never to come back again. I was deeply saddened  by this. For the brief period that Max was staying at father’s house, I enjoyed life a lot more. He was a big part of my life there. He drove me to places when father and Soumaya were busy, we played card games and [53]had pleasant conversations after dinner,  and we always took walks to the top of the hill ov erlooking father’s neighborhood, which I called the Overlook.  Most importantly, he made me feel less lonely.  I was very saddened by his departure.        Another horrible experience concerning the Bubenheim s occurred . We were having dinner at their house, like we usually did. At the end of the dinner, a few of Pollina’s friends came over. They were all popular, good looking girls and boys. They were the kind of people who I’ve always had the desire to be a part of, but was never able to fit in with. Popular kids… cool kids . When I heard them talking about their awesome lives and their parties, I had a breakdown right then and there. I realized how much I’ve been missing out in my life, and I cried in front of  everyone. I felt like I would never hav e a life as good as theirs. I told everyone that I wanted to commit suicide. Father, Soumaya, Alex, and Karina talked to me for three hours to cheer me up.        Eleventh Grade at Independence ended . Like the previous year, my time at the school went by like a blur. I didn’t talk to anyone. I barely considered it a part of my life. I just did the work that I was required to do while I waited for the bus to take me home.       Once summer started, I sank into a m ajor depression. My feelings of inferiority were intensified by the recent events with the Bubenheims. The Bubenheims were family friends… but now they represented the very thing that destroyed my whole life and took away my happiness.       It was at this  time that I was just beginning to realize, with a lot of clarity, how truly unfair my life is. I compared myself to other teenagers and became very angry that they were able to experience all of the things I’ve desired, while I was left out  of it. I never  had the experience of going to ",1
"50","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","a party with other teenagers, I never had my first  kiss, I never held hands with a girl, I never lost my virginity. In the past, I felt so inferior and weak from all of the bullying that I just accepted my lonely life and de alt with it by playing WoW, but at this point I started to question why I was condemned to suffer such misery.        There was nothing I could really do about my unfair life situation. I felt completely powerless. The only way I could deal with it  was to continue to drown all of my troubles with my online games. I played WoW really hard, leveling two new characters to 70. At mother’s house, I sometimes played it for fourteen hours a day. James, Steve, and Mark would always joke that there was never a time that they saw me offline. I was known as the guy who was “always on WoW”.       My laptop was getting slower and slower. It wasn’t a very powerful laptop, but it was the only computer I had to play WoW on. This was really frustrating me, because eventually  it became so slow that it ruined my gaming experience. I kept pestering my mother and father to get me a faster laptop that was more efficient for gaming.        For my 17th Birthday, my parents agreed to split the funds for a new laptop. My mother took m e to Best Buy to choose it out, and I found the perfect one. It was a larger, highly efficient dark -colored laptop designed for gaming. After we bought it, we had dinner at the Japanese restaurant Kabuki on Ventura Boulevard, the same restaurant my mother took me to after my 5th Grade graduation.   17 Years Old        Father told me that Max invited me to visit him in France for three weeks. I would have to travel there alone, and Max would pick me up at the airport near his hometown  of Montpellier. At first  I was very anxious  about  it, and I was about to say no. Father talked me into it, saying that I was lucky to have an opportunity like this. I really missed Max, and I wanted to see him again, so I quickly made the decision to go.  [54]     I left around the be ginning of August. This was my first time traveling alone, and I didn’t know what to expect. Father signed me up to have supervised travel assistance to help me along the way, otherwise I would get lost in the airport. On the way there, I made a stop in Fr ankfurt, Germany to transfer planes. Germany became  another country I can add to the list of places I’ve been. When I arrived at the airport in France, I waited for a few hours and finally Max showed up. I was really happy to see him.  I couldn’t believe I was actually in France again.       Max and I stayed at his grandmother’s house in Montpellier. Montpellier was an exquisite city, with a romantic and cultured vibe to it. It was such a pity that I was too caught up in my own world to truly appreciate it at  the time.       Max introduced me to his life in France. I met with some of his friends and we went to bars together. In France, the legal drinking age is 16, so I was able to drink alcohol at a bar. It was ast ounding! For those three weeks, I had the fain test taste of what life was like for normal young people. The experience of hanging out with a group of young people, boys and girls, and enjoying life was something I never did before. I t really turned my whole world around, for that short amount of time. So this is what everyone else gets to experience , I thought to myself with jealousy. I felt a sense of happiness and bliss that I hadn’t felt since childhood, when life was good.       During the trip, we visited the town of Arles  where we stayed in the hotel that Max’s family owns. Max told me about all of the sexual experiences he had. I never knew he had such an active sex life. The more he talked to me about it, the more envious I becam e. I questioned to myself why he got to experience such an amazing life, while I had to suffer so much loneliness and humiliation. I was introduced to some of the girls he had sex with in the past, and they were all pretty. On top of that, his family was e xtremely wealthy and they owned a sprawling mansion in the countryside. Where’s the justice?  I thought. Why couldn’t I have been born into that life? I envied Max so much. His life must have been heaven on earth. Despite my envy of Max, I couldn’t hate him , at least at that time. He was the only popular young person who ever reached out to me. He invited me to visit his home, and he treated me like a friend. For that, I will always have a grudging respect for Max Bonon.        After three weeks in France doi ng exciting social things, I returned to my lonely life in the U.S., where I became even more depressed than I was in the beginning of summer, especially after getting a taste of what life was truly like for normal people. I knew I could never live such a pleasurable life, and the knowledge haunted me. I was back to my routine of World of Warcraft. At least the new expansion was coming out soon, and I tried to look forward to that.        When Twelfth Grade began, I made a vow to finish high school before th e month of March . The high school system at Independence allows students to work at their own pace, so the more extra work I did, the sooner I could graduate. I was always depressed and bored for the few hours a day I had to spend there, and  I disliked all  of the degenerate, low -class  students there. They repulsed me. I wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, and it became my goal for the year.  At the end of school time every day I asked my teachers to give me extra homework assignments, and I stoppe d myself from playing WoW until I completed them.        The second ex pansion for World of Warcraft  finally released, called Wrath of the Lich King. When I got home from school, I wanted the game so badly. Mother wasn’t home from work yet, so she couldn’t drive me. I decided to walk all the way to Best Buy to pick up the game. It was a long walk that took almost an hour. On the way home I was very hungry and stopped at Panda Express to eat lunch. Planet Cyber was right next to that Panda Express, so I walked  in there for a few seconds to reminisce about better times before hurrying home to install the game.  Once it was installed, James and I played it together all afternoon.  [55]      I found out that one of my teachers at Independence, Mr. Perales, also played W oW. From then on, the two of us would talk about the game every day. It was nice to have someone at school to talk to, and I enjoyed telling him about my daily progression with my character. This made my time at school a lot less mundane and boring.        James, Steve, and Mark were the closest thing I had to a group of friends.  I played with them online almost every day. We had so many adventures in WoW as a group, and yet… I felt like the outcast of the group. Steve and Mark only considered me an onl ine friend, never a real friend. I found out that the three of them had WoW meet -ups at one of their houses a lot, and they never invited me. Sometimes, when I would be playing with them online, I would find out that they were  all together in real life, an d I was the only one left out. Whenever they did this, I acted bitter towards them through the game, but they didn’t even care. Even in the World of Warcraft, I was an outcast, a lone and unwanted.        The more lonely I felt, the more angry I became. The anger slowly built up inside me throughout all of the dark years.  Even after the release of the new WoW expansion, I noticed that the game’s ability to alleviate my sense of loneliness was starting to fade. I began to feel lonely even while playing it, and  I often broke down into tears in the middle of my WoW sessions. I began to ask myself what the point was in playing this game anymore. I spent less and less time playing it.             One day I found some posts on the internet about teenagers having sex , and I was once again reminded of the life I had been denied. I felt that no girl would ever want to have sex with me… And I developed extreme feelings of envy, hatred, and anger towards anyone who has a sex life.  I saw them as the enemy.  I felt condemned  to live a life of lonely celibacy while other boys were allowed to experience the pleasures of sex, all because girls didn’t want me. I felt inferior and undesirable. This time, however, I couldn’t just stand by and accept such an injustice anymore. I ref used to continue hiding away from the world and forgetting about all the insults it dealt to me.       I began to have fantasies of becoming very powerful and stopping everyone from having sex. I wanted to take their sex away from them, just like they took  it away from me. I saw sex as an evil and barbaric act, all because I was unable to have it. This was the major turning point. My anger made me stronger inside. This was when I formed my ideas that sex should be outlawed. It is the only way to make the wo rld a fair and just place. If I can’t have it, I will destroy it. That’s the conclusion I came to, right then and there.       I spent more time studying the world, seeing the world for the horrible, unfair ",1
"51","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","place it is. I then had the revelation that just b ecause I was condemned to suffer a life of loneliness  and rejection , doesn’t mean I am insignificant. I have an exceptionally high level of in telligence. I see the world differently than anyone else. Because of all of the injustic es I went through and the world view I developed because of them, I must be destined for greatness. I must be destined to change the world, to shape  it into an image that suits me!        At the beginning of the winter break, I decided to quit playing World of Warcraft entirely. On m y last day on the game, I had a long, emotional conversation with James where I opened up about all of my troubles. I told him about all my newfound views of the world, and my belief that sex must be abolished. He seemed to be supportive of my stance, and I was glad that he understood me. It was a very memorable day.       My father’s movie was  released, but it did not do well at all. He was only able to get it released in a few select theatres, and no one was interested in seeing it. He stupidly invested a ll of his money into the [56]movie, and he got absolutely nothing out of it. This caused him to fall into a financial crisis that he will be stuck in for a long time. I was annoyed that he kept having to make it clear to us that he was now in a “financial cris is”. He talked about it all the time, and it was embarrassing.       What a bitter coincidence, that right  at the point when my life fell  even deeper into agony, my father is cursed with this financial crisis. Right at the time when I needed  my father’s su pport the most, he los t all of his assets. It was as if some malevolent being cursed me with bad luck. I truly had no advantage at all. The universe was not kind to me.        I formed an ideology in my head of how the world should work. I was fueled both by my desire to destroy all of the injustices of the world, and to exact revenge on everyone I envy and hate. I decided that my destiny in life is to rise to power so I ca n impose my ideology on the world and set eve rything  right. I was only seventeen, I have plenty of time. I thought to myself. I spent all of my time studying in my room, reading books about history, politics, and sociology, trying to learn as much as I can.      I became a new person, furiously driven by a goal. My torment would continue, but I had something to live for. I felt empowered.        I went over to James’s house to have a sleepover. Usually when I went there we spent the whole time playing WoW , with the exception of walking to town for lunch. Because I quit WoW, this was the first time we had to find other things to do. We spent most of the time going on walks around the Palisades town center, or along the Palisades Bluffs, talking about our vi ews of the world and our hopes and dreams. I told him more about my hatred of people who have sex. James quickly deduced the reason for why I was so fervent about abolishing sex… that in truth I really want to have sex but I feel like I can never have it, so I wish to take it away from everyone else. He read me very well. I had to admit that he was right.  That is the exact reason for it.        I fulfilled my vow of finishing high school by March. In fact, I finished a bit earlier than I expected – in mid-February. I completed so many homework assignments towards the end, especially since I no longer played WoW. I was glad to be done with it. School was finally over. Not having to go to school anymore gave me a lot of free time to think and brood.        As ti me progressed, I realized how hopeless everything in my life was. The chances that I will ever rise to power and right the wrongs of the world were extremely slim. I had absolutely no idea or plan of how to acquire any sort of power. It was naïve of me to think that I could one day b ecome a dictator. The only thing  I could do was fantasize about it.       My whole world twisted  even deeper into darkness and despair as my depressing life continued on. My hatred for people who have sex festered inside me like a plague. I frequently went on walks around town to brood over how hopeless and unfair everything was. It was better than being stuck in my room all the time. When I saw young couples walking around at the mall, my anger and hatred intensified greatly. It was the worst torture ever to see them making out and being intimate. My life, if you can call it a life, was living hell.        My parents quickly took note of how radical I was becoming, and they made a hasty plan to change my life. Of course, that is what they claimed. I think they were just trying to find a way to get rid of me because I was too hard to deal with. Soumaya was going back to Morocco, and they decided to send me with her. It was the most ridiculous plan I’ve ever heard.       They announced  this to me at a café near my mother’s house. I was expecting something extreme, something drastic, but this? It completely caught me off guard. Morocco? They think I’ll be happy there?  I furiously thought with disbelief. I was devastated, and for a moment  I couldn’t even speak. The last [57]thing I wanted was to hide away in a backwater country with nothing to do, while all of my peers enjoy life in the U.S. I didn’t want to run away from my troubles in the U.S., I wanted to confront them. I just didn’t know how. Going to Morocco was the absolute worst solution for me, and they intended for me to stay there for a long time.       After hearing this news, I felt a sense of urgency that I had never felt before. They already had a plane ticket ready for me, and I was scheduled to leave in five days. My immediate goal was to stop my parents from sending me to Morocco. Throwing a tantrum with my mother didn’t work. She was set on this.       I spent the remaining five days at father’s house. While there, I chose not t o protest at all, because I knew it wouldn’t work. They will force me onto that plane one way or another. I decided to keep quiet and devise a plan of escape. I bided my time, and didn’t talk much to father or Soumay a during those last few days. The plan I  came up with was to run away on the morning before the flight, walk all the way to my mother’s condo, and hide in a secret spot on the roof. It would be a place where they least expected me to be.       I kept quiet in the last couple of days to throw off their suspicion, but that backfired and made them even more suspicious. I suppose they expected me to protest about going, and my silence made them think I was up to something.       When the time came, I decided to get up at 4:00 a.m. to prepare. To my di smay, I noticed that my father set an alarm on the front door. I was planning to run away at 6:00 a.m., when the garbage truck arrived, because the noise from the truck would mask any noise I make while leaving. The alarm, however, would definitely alert f ather and Soumaya. I got too nervous and abandoned that idea. Instead, I waited until everyone woke up and had breakfast. My plan was ruined by the alarm, and I had to come up with a new plan fast! I had little time left. I innocently told father I wanted to go on a small walk before the departure , and as soon as I exited the front door, I bolted at full speed. It was hasty, but I had to do something. I didn’t think father would catch on to my deception so quickly… After only clearing one block, I looked be hind  my shoulder and saw father chasing after me. All of my hope collapsed then and there, and I lost all of the fight in me. I stopped running and put my head down in defeat. Soumaya came in the car minutes later, and they both took me hom e. The plan failed. I was going to Morocco.       The journey to Morocco was the most horrendous travel experience I’ve ever had. It was just me, Soumaya, and four -year -old Jazz. Jazz kept screaming and vomiting on the plane, Soumaya was in a sour mood, and I was completely miserable. I thought my whole life was all over. I had nothing to look forward to in the future. I wanted to die.       Once I got there I felt like all of the life in me had drained out. I was so defeated. I couldn’t help but cry all the time, even in front of Soumaya’s relatives. Khadija didn’t understand why I was so upset, and she got offended that I was crying on the first day at her house. It was a complete disaster.       I kept dreaming of home. I thought of the prospect of being  able to return home, and a small hope sparked in me. I kept emailing my mother frequently, telling her how much I hated being there and how much I cried all the time. I told her that if she would give me one more chance and enable me to come home, I will try harder  to lead a better life and become a person she could be proud of. After a week of doing this, mother gave in and flew to Morocco to take me home.  I won. I was going home.        When I returned to the U.S., I felt so relieved that I forgot about m y troubles for a few days and relaxed. It was good to be back home. This is where my fight is, right here in the U.S., and nowhere else.       The sense ",1
"52","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","of elation I felt soon wore off. My lonely life as a social outcast resumed.        I continued going on  my usual long walks every day, feeling angry and hateful towards the world. During mother’s week, I would walk to the mall and sit on the balcony overlooking the food court next [58]to the AMC theatres. There I would see all of the young couples lining up to see a movie, and I boiled with hatred. During father’s week, I walked to the Calabasas Commons nearby, and sometimes I rode my bicycle. I also walked up the hill near my father’s house to the Overlook . I spent a lot of time up there, contemplating about my  life and fantasizing about becoming powerful enough to punish everyone I hate.       On one  dreadful day, when I was riding my bicycle near Calabasas, a group of popular teenagers in an SUV drove by and made fun of me. I suppose my appearance didn’t help w ith that. I looked exactly like the outcast I was. I was still wearing plain polo shirts and khaki pants at the time, covered with a blue zip up hoodie and a black baseball cap.  It was a torturous experience, and the pain I felt from it never went away. Al l I wanted was to fit in with those popular kids who lived such pleasurable lives, but instead I was ridiculed and reviled by them. They made me feel so inferior and undesirable. I will never forget that experience. It was burned into my memory.       My mi sery became harder and harder to bear, and none of my parents understood my plight. My father thought that all was well with me.  How could he be so blind?  He was so caught up in his failing work that he didn’t care about how my life was turning out. I curs ed him for it. My father never made any effort to prepare me for facing such a cruel world. He never taught me how to attract girls. He never warned me that if I didn’t attract girls at an early age, my life would fall into a miserable pit of despair! Agai n… How could he be so blind? I asked myself constantly.        It all came to a climax on one of the days that I walked to the Calabasas Commons. I treaded through the area with my head down, all alone, in a state of complete despair about my life. I looked  around me and saw lots of young couples holding hands and groups of good looking teenage boys and girls walking together and having fun on their Satu rday night out. I saw all of tho se teenagers enjoying their pleasurable lives together, while I was all al one. They were enjoying everything I couldn’t hav e. I was filled with intense anguish, and I quickly ran all the way back to father’s house with tears pouring down my cheeks. Once I got home I had a breakdown and cried for hours and hours into the night.   Part 5  Hope and Hopelessness  Age 17 -19       When I woke up the next morning, I felt a bit calmer. Calmer enough to think clearly about what just happened. I couldn’t bear to have my life continue this way, so I tried to evaluate why I have had to suffer so much. I spent the whole day in calm me ditation, deeply reviewing my life to see how I fell to this dark place. I concluded that I cannot just give up on having the life I want if I never try to get it. I realized that I was still only seventeen, and that there are many possibilities for me in the future. I wanted to give myself a new chance at life, despite all the odds that were against me. I wanted something to live for, something to look forward to in the future. This calm session of contemplation made me feel a lot better.       I told my pa rents and my sister that I was willing to make a renewed effort to change. They seemed very happy with me. For once, in their eyes, I wasn’t being negative about life.        I examined myself in the mirror and decided that if I want to make a fresh start, the first thing to do would be to change my appearance.  I got a haircut, and then my mother and sister took me shopping at the Fallbrook mall for some new clothes. I knew nothing about fashion at the time, so I just chose a few new jeans. I hadn’t worn jea ns since I was ten years old. For the first time in many years , I started to care about how I looked again.  [59]      I spent a few more days calming myself down. I then started to feel something that has been lost to me for a long time: Hope.       Without h ope, I just couldn’t go on any longer. I needed to feel hope. Hope for the future, hope for a better life. Upon feeling this, I realized that perhaps it is possible for me to have the things I desire; to have a great social life again, to have a girlfriend , to have sex, to have all of the pleasures I’ve desperately craved for so long. It was refreshing.        On the 4th of July, we went to a big party at the Lemelson’s. There, I had a heavy discussion with James about my revelation and goals. He seemed very  glad that I had a newfound zest for life. He admitted that he was getting very worried about me, from the way I was going. James was in a similar situation as I was. He was a virgin like me, never having much interaction with girls  in his life. The two of  us talked for hours about our troubles and our hopes of overcoming them. It was nice to have such a good friend like James on my side, who could understand and relate to me.        I made a new Facebook profile (which I still use to this day) in an effort to improve my social life. Having been so lost in my own world for the last four years, I didn’t know much about these new social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace. The last time I was interested in such things was when I made an AIM account, b ut no one used that anymore.       Once I fired up my profile, was able to reconnect with a few friends from Topanga Elementary. I talked to Philip over Facebook, and the two of us made plans to meet up later in the summer after not seeing each other for t wo years.       I also attempted to reconnect with my old friends Charlie and John Jo, remembering all of the great experiences I had with them. I managed to speak with them on the phone a couple of times, but they didn’t seem keen on meeting up, and I subs equently abandoned the effort.        I had a quiet 18th Birthday at a restaurant with my family. Soumaya  was still in Morocco, so mother and father agreed to meet for it. It was one of the few times that I had dinner with both my mother and my father since their divorce. I received some birthday cards from relatives, wishing me a great year ahead. I took a v ow that day to make this new year of my life a happy one, to turn my life around and fulfill all of my desires.       And so began a period of great yearning. A great chase, so to speak. I will chase after a hope that I built for myself, only to have that hope shattered at every turn.   18 Years Old        I was 18, a high school graduate, and summer was nearing its end. I had to think about continuing my education. I was eager to be as productive with my time as I could be. College represented a hope for me. I would be starting a new kind of school where there are lots of people and opportunities. I might possibly make friends, have interactions with girls, maybe even get a girlfriend! The thought filled me with enthusiasm.       And so I enrolled at Pierce C ollege, the first of a few colleges I would jump to  in my many desperate attempts to find a desirable life . Pierce College is a large community college in Woodland Hills, not far from both my mother’s and father’s houses. When I looked through the list of classes, I saw that most of them were already full. The only class I was able to get was a computer class, and I settled with that. I could always spend time at the college even while not in class, I concluded. Having only one class would help me ease into  college at a milder pace. I hadn’t been in a normal school system for three years. I [60]feared I might get nervous. But then, after thinking about everything I had been through in the last few months, I knew I had the strength and courage to tackle it.        My mother made the decision to move to a new apartment near Calabasas. She took me and my sister there to show it to us beforehand. The room that I would get would be smaller, and it wouldn’t have its own bathroom, but the apartment was located in a much better area. It was walking distance from my father’s house, the Mulholland shopping center, and the Calabasas Commons. I ended up persuading my mother to move there, as it would be much more convenient.       On the first day at the new place, I took a lon g stroll around the nearby areas. Of course, those areas weren’t unfamiliar to me, as I had walked around there many times during father’s week. But this was the first time I went on a long walk since my breakdown, and it made me feel more confident.        I met up with Philip Bloeser after not seeing him for two years. The last time I saw him was during the summer I turned 16. My mother dropped me off at this house, and I wasn’t surprised to find that he was still the exact same person; mature, reserve d, a little awkward, and prone to random bouts of hyper energy. Jeffrey was also there, and he was still as wild and boisterous as ever, though he ",1
"53","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","had changed a lot in appearance, no longer being the little kid I was so used to seeing him as.       Philip already had his driver’s license, so the two of us went out in his car to meet Addison Altendorf, who had just moved back to the U.S. and was living with his mother in an apartment in Malibu.  Philip and Addison have always been very close friends with each other , and the two of them go ev erywhere together. I hadn’t  seen Addison since Topanga Elementary. At first glance, I didn’t know what to make of him. It was like meeting a whole new person. He had changed tremendously. With his mustache and hairstyle, he looked older than he was, cultivating a refined and sophisticated personality and wearing an elegant blazer coat.       As I spent time with Addison that day, I started to enjoy talking to him about politics and the world. He was very intelligent and more informed than other people our age.        I bought my first Lottery ticket when I went out shopping with my mother one day. We stopped at Ralph’s where I noticed the Lottery machine. I didn’t know anything about the Lottery, so I asked my mother about it. She told me how it works and taught me how to buy a ticket. Each ticket provides a very small chance of winning millions of dollars, and the jackpot could rise to the hundreds of millions. I couldn’t believe it. I d idn’t know such a thing existed!  After bu ying my ticket, I felt thrilled with the prospect of having a chance to become a multi -millionaire. That ticket, of course, didn’t win. And neither would any of the tickets I buy after it, but they would  give me hope.       I never thought nor cared about m oney before I turned 18, because I was still living like a child, with my parents handling the money and giving me the things I needed. However, the more older I grew, the more I realized how important money was, and the more obsessed I would become about getting rich. This obsession, which was bare ly taking root at the time, spark ed a long re lationship the Lottery that would  only end in disappointment and despair.        At father’s house, we watched the movie Alpha Dog after dinner one night. This movie depicts a lot of teenagers and young people partying and having sex with beautiful girls, living the life that I’ve desired for so long. The main character is a fifte en year old kid who has sex with two hot girls in a swimming pool. I was so envious that I delighted in his death at the end. I remember thinking that I would rather live his life than mine, even though he died. He had sex and I didn’t. The movie deeply af fected me emotionally, and I would think about it for some time afterwards.   [61]     I started my new semester at Pierce College. I still hadn’t obtained my driver’s license yet, so I was forced to take the public bus to school. This was an extremely unpleasa nt experience, but I was willing to bear with it just so I could go to college and improve my life.       On my first day, I couldn’t help but feel nervous. The place reminded me of Taft, though the people seemed nicer and the environment was less intimidat ing. When I settled down into my class, I felt that things will turn out ok.        Soumaya returned from Morocco, and she was very angry with me due to the way I acted while I was there. She effectively kicked  me out of father’s house, and because I was e ighteen, she was allowed to. Father didn’t do anything to stop her, being the weak man that he is.  This is how it has always been. Father has always given Soumaya free reign to impose her rules on the household. He gave her all the power.       This act off icially ended the one week -one week arrangement, and mother’s house became my permanent living place.       Not only did she kick me out of father’s house, but she forbade me to go there even for a short visit. And still, father didn’t do anything about it.  Father kept saying that the house is her house as much as his, and that she has the right to kick me out. No! I am the eldest son! The house should be MY house before hers! This caused any respect I still had for my father to fade away completely. It was such a betrayal, to put his second wife before his eldest son. What kind of father would do that? The bitch must be really good to him in bed, I figured.  What a weak man.        Every day, I tried to make some effort to go out looking for ways to improve my  life. I felt that staying in my room was a waste of time. I knew what I wanted, but I had no idea how to get it. I frequently went on walks around my mother’s neighborhood in the desperate hope that someone would befriend me or a girl would talk to me. No thing of the sort ever happened.       Sometimes I walked all the w ay up to the Overlook, as my mother’s apartment was just around the other side of it; And sometimes I walked to the Calabasas Commons, where I would hang out at Barnes & Noble, reading books , always with the hope that some young people would reach out and befriend me, but no one ever did.       I kept hoping and hoping and hoping. Hope is what kept me alive.       I continued seeing Philip and Addison, my only other social interaction besides James. I talked to Addison about my old political views, debating with him about what an ideal world would lo ok like. I found out that he had  some fascist views of his own , and it was nice to have a discussion with someone about things that would make most normal people run a mile.       I frequently messaged Addison on Facebook, hoping to start up conversations when I felt lonely. He told me he was just starting his Twelfth  Grade year at Malibu High School, and his goal was to fit in with the popular kids. Fitting in with popular kids at Malibu High School?  I didn’t expect Addison to be successful in such a venture.       Addison invited me to his birthday party. It was a sma ll get -together on the beach in Point Dume, Malibu. I had a very hard time socializing with people, so I ended up drinking too much alcohol. Before Philip drove me home, I vomited outside Addison’s apartment, in front of his mother and everyone else. It was highly embarrassing and I put a lot of effort to block it from my mind afterwards.        James came to my mother’s new apartment for a sleepover. We walked to the Calabasas Commons together. It was nice to show him all of my favorite spots there, like th e window at Barnes & Noble that overlooks the whole area, and turtle ponds next to King’s restaurant. It was a great place to talk and contemplate . We had some deep conversations  about our fantasies and our hopes for the future.  [62]      When I was a child, H alloween used to be a fun and exciting experience, but ever since the last time I went trick -or-treating Halloween has been a time when I spent the whole night in my room while other teenagers were out having fun partying.       On this Halloween, I was de sperate to do something social. I just couldn’t sit in my room on such a night. I found out from stalking random people on Facebook that there was going to be a huge house party in West Hills. I decided to take a big leap forward and attend this house part y, even though I wouldn’t know anybody there. I had nothing to lose, and it would give me more of a chance of meeting girls than if I stayed in my room all night. Because I couldn’t drive, I had to walk all the way there, and it took 45 minutes. When I got  there, I was overcome by anxiety, but I couldn’t back out at that point. I paid the entry fee of $5 and walked right in. To my dismay, the party was smaller than I expected. All of the kids were smoking marijuana, and they all seemed to know each other. I t would only be a matter of time before they detected that I was an outcast. I stood around awkwardly for a few minutes before giving up and walking home.       On the way home, just as I was about to reach my mother’s house , a group of four young thugs drove by me in a pick -up truck and proceeded to throw eggs at me, laughing while they did it. They seemed intoxicated, and they missed me. I picked up one of the shells and threw it right back into their car. I was no longer a weak little kid who would tak e a hit without fighting back. I was stronger now. They got out of their car and tried to attack me, and they would have beaten me bloody if I didn’t pull out my trusty pocket knife, which I usually carried when I walked alone by myself. Thankfully, the th ugs backed away and drove off. Perhaps it was the knife, or the look of extreme hatred in my eyes.  I quickly ran home, terrified. It was an unsuccessful and misfortunate night.        For a few days after Halloween, I kept thinking about that incident with the horrible thugs who almost attacked me. They must have seen me as a weakling who they could bully for their amusement. I didn’t want the world to view me as weak.      This led to my new commitment to start exercising and lifting weights. I began workin g out at the gym in my mother’s apartment complex  every other day. I hoped it would increase my confidence and make me appear a ",1
"54","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","bit stronger.  Maybe if I built muscles, girls will be attracted to me , I hopefully proclaimed to myself.  I had never worked out  or lifted weights  in my life, so my body has always been very frail and delicate. This was a new experience, and it made me feel more productive.        Soumaya’s grudge against me lessened after a couple of months, and she allowed me to go to father’s house for dinner occasionally. I was very angry with father, but I hid my anger. I still needed him.       Father began teaching me how to drive once I received my driver’s permit, which was quite hard to get. I had to take a written test with many questions, and I failed it on my first try. On the secon d attempt, I managed to pass.        My first experience driving was very scary. I’ve played a few racing video games in my life, but driving a car for real was much more intimidating. At first, I could barely ev en drive around my father’s quiet neighborhood. I was overcome by the fear that I will never be able to drive. I soon got more used to it during the next few sessions. Soon enough, I was able to drive a short distance up Topanga Canyon with ease. I still d idn’t feel prepared to take my official driver’s test, though.        Despite my attempts to improve my life, I was still feeling frustrated and angry. I was getting nothing out of my efforts. I still hadn’t made any friends at Pierce College, and I didn’t interact with any girls.  [63]     My days at Pierce College grew mor e and more mundane and depressing. I went to my class on Tuesdays and Thursdays, taking the bus to the AMC and walking the rest of the way. In the classroom, I had a hard time socializing with anyone. Making friends seemed impossible.        My mother was c asually dating a very wealthy man named Jack at the time, though I wouldn’t find out they were dating until much later. When she first mentioned him, I thought he was just a friend. Jack gave mother the keys to his Malibu beach house, and  we went to stay t here for a few nights, though Jack wasn’t there. The house was a beautiful, white -colored mansion located right on a private beach. The backyard had a swimming pool and a hot tub, with a gate leading right onto the shoreline .      Mother had  a small get -together at t he beach house, and she invited James  and his family, along with some other friends. James  didn’t s how up, but his father Arte did . To my surprise, Maddy Humpreys and her mother came  over . Seeing Maddy for the first time in six years was a very peculiar experience. The last time we saw each other, we were just kids. Now, she was a fully -grown teenage girl, and from looking through her Facebook pictures, I knew she was popular. She was a typical pretty girl who had lots of pretty friends. She was one of them , one of the popular kids.  My first friend in America, someone I played with innocently as a child, had grown up to represent the type of people who have caused me so much pain in my life.  I was very nervous talking to her, as I had no experienc e with talking to young girls, but I had to make the effort. She seemed weirded -out by my awkwardness. It was cringe -worthy.       While staying at the beach house, I invited Philip and Addison over to hang out, as they were always in Malibu together. They came to pick me up, and while I was in the car with them, Addison kept talking about how successful he has been at mingling with the popular kids at Malibu High School. He kept talking about all of the parties he’s been to, and all of the pretty girls he h as met. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Addison actually did it.  He succeeded in becoming popular at his school. In such a short time, he was able to accomplish what I’ve been trying to do my whole life. I was extremely jealous. And that was not the  worst of it.       As I spent more time with them that night, I noticed that Addison’s new status amon gst the popular Malibu crowd had  changed his attitude. It made him very cocky and arrogant. He treated ME like a loser the whole time. Later that night, h e ditched me and Philip to go to a party with some girls that he knew from Malibu. I was seething with rage.       We then went to the Santa Monica pier with Philip’s friend Lenny, and I saw young couples everywhere. I used to love going to the Santa Monica pier as a child, but now it was a place of vileness. After putting up with Addison’s insulting behavior, this was too much. I became so upset that I tried my first cigarette. I would end up smoking a few times after that, though I would quit within  a few weeks  due to it having no effect on me.       When Philip dropped me  back to the beach house, I walked to the beach in the middle of the night and yelled out my anguish to the roiling ocean.        After that last experience with Philip and Addison, my attit ude changed. My newfo und optimism about life subsided, and I began  feeling intense anger and hatred towards the world again. The way Addison treated me made me realize what the world thinks of me. If I was one of those popular kids, Addison would have trea ted me with deference and respect, but I wasn’t. I was a complete loser in his eyes, and everyone else’s. No effort I made in the last few months changed the way the world saw me. The world still viewed me as a weak and undesirable loser, even though I cha nged my wardrobe and started working out. What was the point anymore? I asked myself. I couldn’t help but feel anger and hatred. Life was too unfair to me.        I continued going on walks around mother’s house in the desp erate hope that I might possibly  cross paths with some pretty girl who would be attracted to me. I would have been satisfied wit h that. [64]Sometimes I spent two or  three hours wandering around the neighborhood. It was all I could do. I never met any girl. Each walk left me bitterly disappoint ed, and eventually I stopped doing it altogether.       My time at Pierce College  became more miserable each day  I went there. I despised having to take the bus. I t was embarrassing and stressful, and it sucked all of the pride out of me. And for what? To go to one class where I didn’t talk to anyone? There was no point in it anymore. I couldn’t stand the feeling of loneliness I had there. No one wanted to be my friend. It just wasn’t worth the trouble. I decided to drop my class.        My mother got very a ngry that I dropped my class at Pierce, even though I  thoroughly  explained to her the reasons . This was when she started pressuring me to get a job.  Getting a job is something I never thought about before in my life, and I soon realized that the older I be came, the more it was expected of me if I didn’t go to college. To placate my mother, I started searching for jobs online every day, but I wasn’t able to find one that was suitable for me.        I felt hatred and dissatisfaction with the world and society,  but I didn’t want to hide away from it anymore. I needed to be as productive with my time as possible, and I had a lot of free time at this point. The best way to make use of this time, I concluded, was to spend it self -educating myself. Knowledge is powe r.      I began a daily routine of walking to Barnes & Noble in Calabasas every day, where I would spend hours reading books that ranged from biographies of powerful leaders, histories of significant periods, self- help books , philosophy and psychology text s, and historical fiction novels. I sometimes even spent entire days there, from the time it opened to the time it closed. In the afternoons, to my extreme rage, I sometimes saw young couples strolling through the store. Sometimes they would even sit on th e reading chairs, kissing and fondling each other. Whenever I saw this, I got so overcome by envy and heartbreak that I went to the bathroom to cry.  The occasional couples didn’t stop me from going there, however, because it was the most beneficial thing f or me to do at that moment.        I still met up with Philip and Addison  occasionally , even though I hated Addison . They provided me with a sense of a social life, and a way for me to vent about my troubles. Addison treated me like a lowlife every time I hung out with them, and he kept bragging about the girls he met at parties in Malibu. I indignantly accused him of lying, as that was what I wanted to believe. He was only amused by my envy. I then found that Addison deleted me from his Facebook friends li st out of the blue. This was the last slight I would bear from him, and I subsequently sent him a hateful Facebook message in response. I then viewed Addison as a bitter enemy of mine. He truly was a disgusting a nd treacherous little bastard.       Addison  was once in the same position as I, but right when he succeeded in integrating with the popular kids, he betrayed me and treated me the same way the popular kids treated me, as if I’m lowlife scum. The world truly is a brutal place, where a man must fight  a bitter struggle against all other men to reach the top. Humans are nothing but vicious ",1
"55","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","beasts in a jungle.        I delved more into learning as much as I could from books at Barnes & Noble. I expanded on the political and philosophical ideals I concocte d when I was seventeen, and I soon became even more radical about them  than I ever was before . It was all fueled by my wish to punish everyone who is sexually active, because I concluded that it wasn’t fair that other people were able to experience sex while I have been denied it all my life. I started to have the desire to create a world where no one is allowed to have sex or relationships. I again saw that as the perfect, fair world. Reproduction can be accomplished without sex, through artificial insemin ation. Sex is evil, as it gives too much pleasure to those who don’t deserve it.  [65]     I shaped all of these ideals through learning and self -educating myself for hours every day. My personality became even more ri gid, and I started to dress in very conserv ative attire.        I went with my mother to the yearly Christmas party at the Lemelson’s. I spent most of the time with  James, discussing with him further about my ideals. We also played a lot of video games with Noah and his friends. Noah was really inte rested in Nintendo games, and he had a lot of them. Playing games with them reminded me of a time, long ago in my past, when I played Nintendo 64 as a child, blissfully living life in a world that I thought was good. I longed to be a child again, to be in a bright place away from the cruel darkness of reality. I will always treasure those memories.        I had to go Christmas shopping, and I decided to do it at the Calabasas Commons. I was always going there anyway. While walking around, I ran into Maddy, w ho was there with her boyfriend. For some strange reason, I have never had any sexual attraction towards Maddy, despite the fact that she’s a blonde girl and I’m obsessed with blondes. Perhaps it was because she used to be my friend when we were children, I don’t know. Because I wasn’t attracted to her, I didn’t find myself feeling as much jealousy as one might think I would in such a situation. It was still very awkward. I just said hello to her quickly and walked away.        On New Year’s Eve of 2010, th e day that marked the end of the decade, I caught a terrible illness and had to stay in bed for the whole afternoon as well as the next day. My mother was going to go to one of her friend’s houses, but she felt sorry for me and stayed at home. I spent the whole time lying in my bed, brooding about my life. I don’t know what was worse, the physical pain I felt from the sickness, or the emotional pain and rage I had towards the world. I would say the latter.       When the illness had passed on the following afternoon, I thought about how it  caused me to waste  my New Year’s holiday in my room, but then I mused that I would have done the same thing anyway, whether I was sick or not, because I had no friends to celebrate New Year’s with.       I checked Addison’ s Facebook profile with one of my stalking accounts, and I saw that he went to a huge New Year’s party at a mansion with his popular Malibu friends. He took lots of pictures of himself posing with various girls. I hated him so much when I saw that. The lev el of hatred I felt was unreal. He was doing everything I wanted to do! Why him and not me? I cursed at the world.  What was seen can never be uns een, and I will never forget it, nor will I forgive it.        My hope that I will one day have a beautiful girlfriend and live the life I desire slowly faded away. I was in the same dark and miserable place I had been a year previously; lonely, unwanted, miserable, and seething with rage at the world. I kept thi nking about how some boys were easily able to get girlfriends straight after they went through puberty. I couldn’t fathom how they did it, and I hated and despised them for it.       I kept thinking about Leo Bubenheim, and how he kissed that girl Nicole a t the Sagebrush Cantina when he was only twelve. Twelve! He was able to have an intimate experience with a girl when he was only twelve;  and there I was at eighteen, still a kissless virgin. My envy of Leo became an obsession. I kept asking my sister for i nformation about him, but she refused to tell me anything. I frightfully wondered if he had lost his virginity already, and he most likely had. He was a popular kid, and girls desired him. Leo was happily living his heavenly life with the knowledge that he ’s worth something to the world, while I had to wallow in my misery and loneliness.       Life is not fair. One can either accept that fact, keeling over in defeat; or one can harness the strength to fight agains t it. My destiny was to fight against the un fairness of the world.   [66]     My mother carried on pressuring me to get a job, and she would never leave me alone about it. She was a bit frustrated that I wasn’t getting one. The two of us had a lot of arguments, and living with my mother became an extreme  hassle.       After signing me up to a program in the regional center, my mother found a life coach to counsel me and help me find a job. This life coach’s name was Tony, a boisterous 40 year old man who came to meet me every other week. I was open to goin g along with this. I had plenty of free time, and I was so lonely that any social interaction was welcome. For our meetings, Tony usually took me out to lunch somewhere in the Valley, where he gave me advice on socializing and self -improvement.        I continued searching for a job, but I still wasn’t able to find one. I refused all of the jobs that Tony suggested to me. The problem was that most of the jobs that were available to me at the time were jobs I considered to be beneath me. My mother wanted me t o get a simple retail job, and the thought of myself doing that was mortifying. It would be completely against my character. I am an intellectual who is destined for greatness. I would never perform a low -class service job.       My father told me that I c ould work for his friend Karl  Champley  for a few weeks, to help him build a staircase in his new house. I knew Karl quite well, for he used to come over to father’s for dinner occasionally . Karl was just finishing up building his new house in Woodland Hill s, just a few minutes away from father’s house, and he offered to hire me to help with the staircase.       I agreed to take this job. Sure, constructio n work was lowly and laborious , but this was different. This was more like assisting a friend, and it wou ld be in a private environment. It was the perfect temporary job opportunity, and it would most definitely get my mother off my back. I still wasn’t able to drive, so I rode my bicycle there from mother’s house every morning. The trip on the bicycle took  30 minutes. It was grueling to ride a bicycle up that steep winding road every day, but it provided good exercise, which I was in need of. I worked with Karl every weekday for about three weeks. It turned out to be quite a pleasant experience. Karl was very  friendly and I enjoyed working with him. When we finished the staircase, which was a spiral staircase that led up to his roof -deck, we took a moment to admire the work we did.       On my last day working for Karl, I decided to stop by at father’s house t o have a drink. I was quite parched from the bicycle ride. I entered the house without knocking because I believed I had the right to. As the  eldest son, the house should be  my house after my father. Soumaya was surprised to see me, and she got angry that I didn’t knock. To teach me a lesson, she ordered me to  go back outside and knock. I refused, telling her that she has no right to order me around anymore. I then helped myself to a glass of water. Soumaya knocked the glass of water out of my hand and it s hattered on the floor. Father clamored angrily up the stairs from his office demanding to know what was going on. The three of us had a heated argument, and of course father took Soumaya’s side. They both kicked me out of the house, telling me that I’m not  to return. I felt betrayed and humiliated as I furiously made my way back to mother’s house. At that very moment, I hated both of them, and I wouldn’t see either of them for many months. For those months, my father was dead to me. My mother was all I had left in this bleak world.        During that same week, I had a climactic meeting with Philip and Addison where my noxious feud with Addison Al tendorf reached a boiling point. We went on an outing to the Griffith Park Observatory, as we usually did when we got together. This time, my arguments with Addison were very intense. I tried to insult him as much as I could, in a petty attempt to get revenge at him for all the insults an d slights he dealt to me. We went back and forth at each other for the whole evening, to the chagrin of poor Philip who had to put up with it. By the end of the night, Addison said something to me that was so [67]offensive it will haunt me forever, and it rang  true: “No girl in this ",1
"56","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","whole world will ever want to fuck you.”       I already felt that no girl in the world wanted to fuck me. I was a kissless virgin after all. That was the sole reason why I was suffering. But to hear it come from someone else , someon e like Addison,  really caused it to sink into core of my mentality and emotions.       That whole night made for a very vile and wicked experience. I decided not to see Philip and Addison for a long time.        Because I was no longer seeing Philip and Addison, James was once again my only friend. I  frequently talked to him over S kype. Sometimes I would go over to his house, where the two of us went on our traditional walks around the Palisades town center. James still played WoW, and he was trying to get me back into it. I was quite tempted. After everything I had been through in the last few months, I did feel the urge to delve back into that void. Facing the world was tough, and it took its toll on me, esp ecially since I’ve seen no results. I w as still in the same position  I had always been: Lonely, unwanted, and miserable.        I found out that my mother was actually dating Jack, the wealthy man who owned the Malibu beach house. I always thought he was on ly her friend. My mother never told me or my sister about any men that she dated. She always kept that strictly private. I hadn’t even met Jack yet. He was worth well over $500 million, and he owned other mansions  in Bel Air and Beverly Hills.       When I found out about this, I started to harbor the hope that my mother will get married to this man, and I will be part of a rich family. That will definitely be a way out of my miserable and insignificant life. Money would solve everything. I started to frequ ently ask my mother to seek marriage with this man, or any wealthy man for that matter. She always adamantly refused, and demanded that I stopped talking about it. She told me that she never wanted to get married again after her experience with my father. I told her that she should sacrifice her well -being for the sake of my happiness, but this only offended her further.        At the beginning of summer, I finally received my driver’s license. I had to take the driving test twice before I passed it. The fir st time, I took it at the Winnetka DMV, and I made a few mistakes at the end which caused me to fail it. After taking some lessons that my mother arranged for me, I gave the driving test another try at  the Thousand Oaks DMV. This area was much easier to na vigate around, so I managed to closely pass the test.       Once my official driver’s license came in the mail, my mother told me some good news.  She received a new car from Jack, whic h meant she c ould  give her older car to me. I no w had a car of my own to drive. To be able to drive to any place I wanted to go provided me with a new sense of freedom that I never felt before. I felt more like an adult rather than a kid. I realized that I could start college again, now that I had the ability to drive there.        I registered for a summer class at Moorpark College.  I read about Moorpark College online and found that it was a much better option than Pierce College. My mother and I drove up there to take a look. The campus was smaller in scale, and more aesthetic ally pleasing. It was located in the town of Moorpark, in a gorgeous mountain area near Thousand Oaks. I also saw a lot more beautiful girls there than I ever saw at Pierce. Everywhere I looked I saw beautiful blonde girls walking around. This college was just right for me.       In the days leading up to my first day at Moorpark, I felt a renewed sense of hope. A new college provided a new start, and this college looked perfect in every way.  I had the hope that I could make it there; that I could make friends, meet some girls, and eventually find a pretty girl to be my girlfriend. I [68]pictured her in my mind all the time;  her cascading blonde hair, her beautiful face, her sensual body… Everything. I imagined us walking hand in hand through the college, looking at the magnificent view of the mountains in the distance as the sun sets behind them. That would be heaven. That  was what I wanted in life. Every single hate -fueled ideal, world -view, and philosophy I created in the past  was a result of not being able to do that.       I was very optimistic on the first day. When I walked onto the campus I breathed in the fresh mountain air and admired my surroundings. I was in a new environment with lots of new possibilities. The class I took wa s a world history class, and it began on a good note. The class was well -structured and the teacher was entertaining. After the class ended, I walked around the college for an hour to explore and ponder over how I can set my life right. Once again, I dared  to hope that there could be a good future for me.        My renewed hope gave me solace for a few days, but it did not last. Moorpark soon became a place of loneliness and despair, just like any other place I’ve attempted to thrive in. The breaking point w as when I saw good looking couples walking along the area where I dreamed of walking with a girlfriend. To watch another boy experience it, with a beautiful girl who should be mine , was a living hell. I constantly asked myself what I did wrong in life, to be unable to have a beautiful girlfriend.       It was no better inside the classroom. There was this one obnoxious jock with a buzz -cut who was taking the class with his gorgeous girlfriend. They always sat next to each other, talking and touching each oth er with affection. Every day I had to see this, and my envy grew and grew. I constantly glared at them with raw hatred. What did I do wrong that he did right? I yelled out to the universe on the way home. Why does he deserve the love of a beautiful girl, a nd not me?  Why do girls hate me so?  Questions and questions. All I could do was questi on why I was suffering so much injustice in life.         My mother one day told me that I should become a writer, because I had some talent in writing. That was strange t o hear. For my whole life I was never talented at anything I tried. I was too physically weak to play sports with other boys when I was little; I never became professional at skateboarding no matter how much I practiced; and I was never that skilled at any  video games I played… even World of Warcraft. Steve and Mark were able to play their characters more skillfully that I ever did, and they start ed the game much later than me. Deep down, I’ve always know n that I had no talents, and I’ve always tried not to think about it.       Indeed, it was strange to hear my mother say that I could become a talented writer, but it did give me an idea. I started to wonder if I actually could become a writer. I could write an epic fantasy story that will be made into a movi e, and I will become rich from it. Being rich will definitely make me attractive enough to have a beautiful girlfriend. It was not impossible, and working towards it would give me something to live for. I mulled it over in my mind for a while.        We wen t to Jack’s beach house in Malibu to spend a couple of nights again. My mother called me on the phone to tell me the plan while I was at college. It was a lonely and depressing day  at school , and I was glad to be able to have some respite at the lovely bea ch house. I immediately drove there from Moorpark after my class was finished.       Mother had a few of her friends over, and she bought a lot of delicious food. After stuffing myself with portions from every dish and drinking multiple glasses of wine, I went on a long and peaceful walk on the beach, wishing that I had a girlfriend to walk beside me. Before I went to bed, I thought a lot more about the possibility of becoming rich. If I was a millionaire and owned a house like the one I was spending that night in, I could have any girl I want. Being in that position would make up for all of the misery I’ve had to go through in the past… and making up for it is my most important goal in life. My one wish is to feel satisfied for the way my life is.  [69]     I s eriously started to consider working towards writing an epic story. I was always creating stories in my mind to fuel my fantasies. Usually those stories depicted someone like myself rising to power after a life of being treated unfairly by the world. I men tally examined all of the stories I had developed, and focused on the few that I thought would become bestsellers. If I could get one of them made into a movie, I would definitely be a millionaire. It was the only solution to my problems. I saw myself as a  highly intelligent and magnificent person who is meant for great things. This could be one of them.        I spent the next couple of weeks focusing on writing for myself instead of working on my schoolwork. The class didn’t give much homework to do anyway . I wrote summaries for three different stories, and I think I showed two of them to my mother. She seemed to think that they would make good movies, and that increased my confidence. I either wanted to write a novel first, or go ",1
"57","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","straight to making it a screenplay.       I spent every afternoon for two weeks working on this goal. My time at college was miserable. I often cried on the way home because I was envious of so many couples walking around. I poured all of my energy into coming up with a way to make this goal work.       My faith that I could write a n epic  story that would make me rich soon collapsed. I read so many articles online of the chances that a screenplay would be made into a movie. I also saw that most writers of even the highest budget film s didn’t make as much as I thought they did… Definitely not enough to live on for the rest of their life. I also thought, with a lot of despair, of the time  that it would take to achieve such a goal. Most bestselling authors  or screenwriters  didn’t become millionaires until they  were well into their forties or  fifties. I didn’t want to wait until I was forty years old to lose my virginity! The thought of spending the next twenty years working hard every day for a chance to make a million or two filled me wi th revulsion. By the time I’d become a millionaire from doing that, I wouldn’t even be able to get hot young girls because I’d be too old. I decided that writing was not my path to salvation, and I abandoned the idea completely. Of course, I would become t antalized with the idea a few more times in the future, but that would be due to  the desperate, false hope that I often create for myself.        I couldn’t stand seeing that damnable couple in my class anymore. I never understood what that pretty girl saw in her brute of a boyfriend. That guy was able to experience his college life with his beautiful girlfriend by his side, while I was all alone. It made me feel so inferior. I had to watch them together, every single day. The torture was unbearable. When I got home from college one day, I dropped my class in a rage.       I didn’t think about how my mother would react to me dropping the class. I knew she would be very disappointed, and I couldn’t afford to have her be disappointed in me. I was relying on her for everything. What she gave to me, she could easily take aw ay. I panicked and resolved to get a job in order to placate her.        After asking Tony , my social skills counsellor,  if I could get a job through the regional center, he called me back and told me that there was a job available for me. I didn’t get much  information about it, but I decided to sign up for it right there and then. After this was secure, I was comfortable enough to tell my mother that I dropped my class at Moorpark. I could have lied to her and told her that I never dropped the class, but at  that time I was too scared to lie to her.       I started a day of working at this new job. It was located in an office building that was connected to an Air port  in Los Angeles. To my horror and humiliation, the job turned out to be a  menial custodial  job, and I had to clean offices and even the bathrooms. There was no way I would ever degrade myself to such a level. I felt like utter shit from even considering working at such a place. I only worked for a few hours while I thought about how to handle this foul situation… and on the next day I called to announce [70]that I was quitting. That was the second and last “job” I would ever have. I only worked there for less than a day.       After I quit, I fell into an even worse state of panic than I was in after I d ropped my Moorpark class. I rapidly pestered myself with the ultimate question: What am I to do now?  I called up Karl Champley to see if he had another job for me  at his house , but he told me that his house was almost finished and there was literally no work for me to do there. I was doomed. I thought that if my mother found out that I quit, she would kick me out of her household.       My mother was taking a vacation in Hawaii  with my sister during this time. I had a few days by myself to relax and plot my next move. I concluded that going to college and enduring the sight of couples walking around was better than having to resort to working a low -class job somewhere, and I had to pick one of the two in order to placate my mother. College was also more beneficial because I could learn and educate myself through it.       I called up my mother and cried to her on the phone, explaining to her why I quit the job that I signed up fo r, and asked  her if she would give me another chance. I told her I will register  for more classes at Moorpark and pour all of my energy into studying hard. I also told her that I will continue with working on my writing. To my relief, she was very understa nding, and she told me she woul d continue to support me if I did  this.        The temporary pressure I had to face that summer was eased, but after thinking about it, I supposed it was insignificant compared to the overall pressure that’s been on my sho ulders ever since I hit puberty:  My struggle against a society that looks down upon me…  against the female gender for denying me sex and love. Addison Altendorf’s hurtful words kept haunting me all throughout the summer. I saw my future and I saw only more bl eak loneliness. I will never have sex. I will never have love. Girls deem me unworthy of it, I thought to myself over and over again. I cried every day when I imagined how much fun and pleasure other teenagers were having as I languished in despair.             My 19th birthday passed by sullenly, and it caused me to feel even more defeated. Nineteen and still a virgin, I miserably proclaimed on that day. My father didn’t even deign to give me a phone call. Instead, he sent me a letter wishing me happy birth day and telling me that he wanted  me to apologize to Soumaya, which of course I refused to do.       The laptop I received on my 17th birthday had become infected with viruses, so my mother bought me a new, even better laptop on my 19th birthday. I chose one that can handle video games very well, because I had just made t he decision to start playing World of Warcraft  again. I just couldn’t handle the anguish in my life anymore, and I needed a break, no matter how unhealthy and time -consuming WoW would be for  me.  19 Years Old        Upon setting up my new laptop, I immediately installed all of my WoW disks. I logged onto my account and took a look at all of my characters that I ha dn’t touched for a year and a half. Right when I logged onto my main character, I  was contacted by James, and he invited me to join an online group with him, Steve, and Mark. They all gave me a warm welcome back.       And there I was, stuck in the void of hopelessness once again; in the exact same position as I had been when I was fou rteen, fifteen, sixteen and seventeen. For all the efforts I made to improve my life during my eighteenth year, I had nothing to show for it. No friends, no girls, no life.       I started going to James’s house a lot more, since I was now able to drive and the two of us could play WoW together again. Seeing James was always pleasant in its own way. He was my comrade in virginity, [71]for he too didn’t get any attention from girls , and I’m sure he suffered from it, but not as much as I did. I was very perplexed as to why he didn’t feel any anger towards girls for denying him sex. He should be just as angry as I am. I supposed he didn’t have a very high sex drive, or he was just a g enerally weak person.       To be angry about the injustices one faces is a sign of strength. It is a sign that one has the will to fight back against those injustices, rather than bowing down and accepting it as fate. Both my friends James and Philip seem  to be the weak, accepting type; whereas I am the fighter.  I will never stand to be insulted, and I will eventually have my revenge against all those  who insult me, no matter how long it takes.        For the rest of the summer, I took it easy and played Wo W with James, Steve, and Mark; just like old times. I also started reading a new book series called A Song of Ice and Fire, by George R.R. Martin. This medieval fantasy series was spectacular. The first book of the series was A Game of Thrones, and once I read the first chapter I just couldn’t put it down. It was like nothing I had ever read before, with a huge array of complex characters, a few of whom I could relate to. I found out that it was going to be adapted into an HBO television series, and I becam e very excited for that.       Delving into fantasy stories like WoW and Game of Thrones didn’t make me forget about all of my troubles in life, but they did give me a temporary and relieving sense of escape, which I need from time to time. Life would be i mpossible to handle without those temporary respites.        Rob Lemelson suggested to my mother that I join the karate class he practices in. Rob was an expert black- belt, and James was also taking the same class with him. They met up every Tuesday and Fr iday night, and I agreed to go on Fridays. Every Friday, I began the routine of driving up to James’s house, and then the two of us would go in James’s car to the karate class in Santa Monica. James got his first car a few months after I got ",1
"58","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","mine, though h is car was a lot older and worn out.       Rob thought that starting karate would be healthy for me, as it is meant to increase confidence and build character. I was eager to see if I could benefit from it. The class was pleasant. It gave me a good work out  and a sense of invigoration. There were usually six or seven other students, and I was particularly annoyed with this one twelve year old kid who seemed to think he was better than me because he was a brown belt and I was a novice white belt. I bet he tho ught he could beat me in a fight because of it… Hah! No chance in that. It was annoying, but I was amused at the same time.       After the karate class, Rob would take us out to a nice restaurant for dinner if he had time. If Rob was busy that night, Jame s and I would go to our usual dinner place in the palisades, and then we would go back to his house to hang out for a while.        My new semester at Moorpark College bega n. I only managed to sign up for one class, but I promised my mother that I would do  at least three classes in the next semester. Both of my grandma’s offered to send me some money to help me out with living expenses, and I wisely saved every check I received from them. One of my priorities was to start building up my money savings in cas e my life became too drastic.       The class I started was a political science class. I figured I would gain some useful knowledge by taking it, though I disliked the teacher because he had the tendency to randomly call on me to answer questions. I was still terrified of speaking in fr ont of the class, even if it was for one sentence. My social anxiety has always made my life so difficult, and no one ever understood it. I hated how everyone else seemed to have no anxiety at all. I was like a cripple compared to them. Their lives must be  so much easier. Thankfully, there were no couples in this class, but I still had to see them when I walked through the school. The only thing I could do was keep my head down and pretend they didn’t exist. I still cried on the drive home every day.  [72]      Grandma Jinx came to visit the United States in October , where she stayed at father’s house. T his presented a difficult situation. She of course wanted to see me, her eldest grandson, but I wasn’t on speaking terms with my father and Soumaya. I was very re sentful of my father for the way he treated me during that last incident, and I will never forgive him for it. My father effectively abandoned me at one of my most crucial points in my life. Though in fact, he was never really present in my life to abandon  me in the first place. When I think about it, he was always absent from my life . When my whole world took a downward spiral into darkness after I hit puberty, he never made any effort to save me. He just didn’t care.       I would never let what happened to me happen to a son of mine, if I had a son… though from the way things have been going, I’ll neve r have a chance to have a son, because g irls don’t want to have sex me . I would make such a better father than my own father.       Grandma Jinx pushed the both of us to reconcile. She insisted that I meet her and father at father’s house, where the three of us would set out to have lunch somewhere. I showed up and gave my grandma a hug. Father didn’t say a word to me, nor I to him.       We went to our local  Japanese restaurant. Father sat in silence while Grandma Jinx asked me lots of questions about my life. Eventua lly we got around to the subject that was hanging in the air. If it weren’t for my grandma, the conversation would have gotten nowhere. Father a nd I went back and forth at each other with accusations. Grandma Jinx persuaded the two of us to drop our grudges and move on. For her sake, we acquiesced. I shook hands with father as we agreed to put the past behind us.       I went on a walk with Grandma  Jinx after we returned to father’s house. I took her up to my old contemplation spot, the hilltop that overlooks father’s neighborhood, which I always called the Overlook . That place is one of the most special places in my life. I have memories of it stre tching back all the way to when I was a joyful ten -year -old. I remember going up there to skateboard all the way down; I rode my bicycle up there during my middle school years; I hiked up there with Max when he was staying at father’s house as an exchange student; I languished there in despair when I went on my lonely walks at the age of seventeen and eighteen; and now I was showing it to my grandma. When the two of us reached the top, every memory came back to me, and I felt a bittersweet sense of nostalgi a.      After the walk, I didn’t want to enter father’s house. Soumaya was in there, and I hadn’t seen her since that dreadful day when she made father throw me out. Once again, my grandma forced the issue, and I agreed to go in for a talk. We all sat down  at the kitchen table and agreed that arguing would get us nowhere. Father and Soumaya were willing to start over, and I agreed to give our relationship another chance. Before my grandma departed back to England, she made us promise to keep up the positive  relations, and made sure that they would invite me over for dinner frequently.        I soon went to one of tho se dinners at father’s house. It wa s an awkward experience , to have dinner with the two of them after all of that tension. We didn’t raise any issues and talked about pleasant things. It was nice to see my brother Jazz again. I was shocked by how much he had grown in the past several months. He was no longer a baby, but a five -year -old boy who was turning six soon. I could actually have full conv ersations with him. He was a very social boy, and quite boisterous… and that started to worry me. He could well turn into one of the people I have despised and envied so much. I felt a hint of jealousy that my five -year- old brother was so well versed in so cial skills at such a young age. I always suffered from shyness  and social anxiety, but Jazz didn’t seem to have that problem.       I put that worry at the back of my mind. He was my brother, and he really looked up to me. He was one of the few people who treated me the way I want to be treated, with respect and adoration. I enjoyed spending time with the boy.   [73]     As I got more used to having a car o f my own to drive , I frequently went on what I called “night drives” around my mother’s neighborhood. They almost replaced the long walks I used to take in the afternoons. Staying in my room all the time only increased my depression. It was suffocating. To ease this suffocation, I frequently got in my car at night, turned on the radio, and went on a drive with no particular destination . The song “Two Is Better Than One” always played on the radio when I  went on those night drives. It made me feel sad, though it was soothing at the same time.  That song will always remin d me of the loneliness I felt during those e xperiences.       I soon learned the hard way to not go on night drives on Fridays and Saturdays. That was when teenagers were out and about. Even in the peaceful residential neighborhood that my mother lived in, I frequently saw bands of teenagers roaming the streets. They were high schoolers , younger than me; mostly skate boarder punks or football jocks who ha d pretty girls beside them. The  sight of them enraged me to no end. It reminded me of the life I missed out on. They were probably on their way to som e house party, where they will get drunk and have sex and do all sorts of fun pleasurable things that I’ve never had the chance to do. Damn them all!        My Autumn semester at Moorpark College flashed by like a subtle lightning bolt. It was as if it didn ’t even exist in my life. Moorpark College was supposed to be a place of hope for me, but it turned into a place of despair, just  like everything else . I was invisible there. Nobody knew I existed or cared who I was. At least this time I finished a class.       The day of my final exam was December 7th, which was also the day the new expansion to World of Warcraft was released, called Cataclysm. I completed my final exam with ease, and thus I completed my first college class, in which I received the grade of  a B. Afterwards, I rushed to Best Buy to purchase the new game. With new WoW expansions, some of those  old feeling s that I felt when I first played the game came back to me, and I wanted that feeling again. It was comforting, and  the sense  comfort was som ething I needed to cushion myself with. I also knew that I would beat James, Steve, and Mark to the next high level cap. I supposed it would provide a small sense of competitive satisfaction. Getting a character to the highest level the fastest was the onl y part of the game that I was truly good at, but I suppose that was due to the massive amounts of free time I had at my disposal. Since my college class was over and it was winter break, I could literally play the game for every waking ",1
"59","ElliotRoger","My Twisted World","really talk to anyone. I did observe, however. I observed how everyone acted, who the “cool kids” were, what they were like… and it was all so intimidating. The social chall enges that I faced in Fifth Grade were intensified tenfold.  [27]     I noticed that there were two groups of cool, popular kids. There were the skateboarder kids, such as Vinny Maggio,  Ashton Moio, Darrel, Wes, and Alex Dib. And then there were the boys who were popular with girls, including Vincent, Robert Morgan, and Oren Aks. They all seemed so  confident and aggressive. I felt so intimidated by them, and I hated them for it. I hated them so much, but I had to increase my standing with them. I wanted to be friends with them.       I also observed the girls. I was still very short for my age, and most of the girls were taller than me. I hadn’t reached puberty yet, but I was starting to admire female prettiness. There was one group of pretty, popular girls, and they all seemed to like hanging out with that boy Robert Morgan. I didn’t yet desire girls sexually, but I still felt envy towards Robert for being able to attract the attention of all the popular girls. What was so special about Robert Morgan?  I constantl y asked myself.       I thought all of the cool kids were obnoxious jerks, but I tried as best  as I could to hide my disgust and appear “cool” to them. They were obnoxious jerks, and yet somehow it was these boys who all of the girls flocked to. This showed me that the world was a brutal place, and human beings were nothing more than savage animals.  Everything my father taught me was proven wrong. He raised me to be a polite, kind gentleman. In a decent world, that would be ideal. But the polite, kind gentl eman doesn’t win in the real world. The girls don’t flock to the gentleme n. They flock to the alpha male. They flock t o the boys who appear to have the most power and status. And it was a ruthless struggle to reach such a height.       It was too much for me to h andle. I was still a little boy with a fragile mind. Thinking about such things would only crush my innocence, and it eventually will. But not at this point.  I subconsciously wanted to enjoy my childhood as much as I could, so I tried not to think about this new revelation and enjoy life in the moment. I put it all aside, to be pondered over later.        My whole world had changed. The “cool” thing to do now w as to be popular with girls . I didn’t know how to go about doing that. Skateboarding , I was able to do… dressing well, that was simple… But attracting attention from girls? How in the blazes was I going to do that?  I didn’t even understand what was so spec ial about it either, but everyone seemed to place so much importance on it. This made me even more shy, and I became known as the “shy new kid .”      Thankfully, some kids started reaching out to me, and I had a few chances to integrate within a couple of weeks. The  first boy to talk to me was Bri ce Miller. He asked me if I had any friends at the school, because he always saw me alone. I admitted t hat I had no friends, and he offered to be my first friend. I was very grateful  for this.       Once again, I used skateboarding as a way to increase my standing, telling the skateboarder kids that I knew how to skateboard and that I could do some tricks. T his got them to treat me more cordially. I even talked to Robert Morgan a few times, who I hated and yet subconsciously revered for being so popular. Whenever a so -called popular kid would say a word to me or give me a high five, I felt immense satisfactio n.        Inevitably, I started to become known to the girls of my school;  and surprisingly, they treated me quite well. It was a huge relief. Middle School would be the last time in my life where I wouldn’t be completely invisible to girls. All of the pre tty girls had a peculiar habit of hugging boys they knew as a form of greeting, and some of them hugged me. I didn’t understand why, but it felt like the best feeling ever. I was one hundred -times more satisfied from getting a hug from a pretty girl than g etting a high five from a popular boy.  It was a new experience that enraptured every fiber of my being.       The 7th and 8th grade girls were especially kind to me. I guess they thought I was “cute” in a boyish sort of way. This made my initial experience  of Middle School much better.   [28]     I decided to attend the school dance in early October. A school dance was completely foreign to me. Elementary Schools didn’t have them, of course, and I only knew about them from watching typical American shows on tele vision. I thought it was something I had to do in order to be cool. I was very nervous, naturally, but I pushed myself to go ahead with it.       When I got there, Robert Morgan saw me and asked me if I wanted to hang out with his group. I was grateful for  this, and I ended up having a nice time. I was shocked that some 7th and 8th grade girls offered to dance with me. They came up to me in a group and taught me how to “slow dance”. I had to place my hands on their hips, while they placed their hands on my shoulders, and we would move slowly with the music. They were all taller than me, and I was terrified, but it felt so… good. That would be the only time in my life where I would have a satisfying experience with girls. The only time.        Halloween of this year marked the last time I would ever go trick -or-treating. After this year I would be too old for it. Mother took us to the Lemelson’s, and I decided to not dress up in any costume. I went as myself, sporting my black Pinecrest swe ater. As it was my last time trick -or-treating, it would be the last time I would have any sort of fun on Halloween. And I did have a lot of fun. It was nice to go out collecting candy  with James and Noah, like we had  been doing for several years past.        My father cut off a portion of the child support he had been paying my mother, which forced my mother to move house. We moved to a small blue house on Glade Avenue in Canoga Park. I didn’t like Canoga Park at all. It was a very ugly and low -class area to the north or Woodland Hills, and I felt it demeaning that we would have to live there during mother’s week.       The house did have some upsides. It had four bedrooms and a bigger living room than mother’s old house. My new room was a lot larger than m y old one. And of course, my mother always had her own ways of making everything better. I would still enjoy my time at mother’s small house more than my time at father’s big Woodland Hills house.       Along with this move, there came a new change in our r otation schedule. My parents decided that we would stay at our mother’s house more, instead of switching one week -one week. Mother would have us for all of the weekdays, and we would go to father’s on the weekends when he was in town.         Around the sam e time that my mother moved, James’s family moved as well, to another Lemelson -owned house in the Palisades. They would only remain in this house for a very brief period, because a tragic event would soon occur in James’s family.       One day at school, I was sitting in my class when I was suddenly called to the office. My mother was there, waiting to pick me up. I got into her car, and the three of us drove out of my school and parked on the side of Shoup Avenue. She told us the dire news. James’s mother, Kim Ellis, had just passed away from breast cancer. I cried for a bit. Kim was a very kind -hearted person, and the mother of my best friend. She had been suffering from breast cancer for several years, but I never thought she would die from it. I immediate ly thought of how James must be feeling. He just lost his own mother! It made me think of how horrible I would feel if the same thing happened to my own mother, just the thought alone filled me with pain.       There was to be a get -together of family friend s at James’s house  that night , in honor of Kim.  On the way, I thought about how I would approach James on the subject. The amount of grief he must be feeling… I couldn’t even imagine it. The last similar experience was the death of my grandfather, and I was only four years old then. When we arrived, I looked for James, and found him sitting in his room. I gently offered my deepest condolences for his loss. He remained very strong, obviously hiding his emotions. He looked very sad, in an extremely stoic sor t of way. He told me he fully accepted what had happened, that his mother was dead and that was the end of it. That was all we spoke on the matter. [29]We tried not to think about it for the rest of the night, and later on I played tag in his backyard with him  and some of his friends.        I remained very shy during my Sixth Grade year, and I would always be labeled as a quiet kid. I wasn’t able to establish any friends that I could have playdate s with, so the only playdates I had was with old friends from Topanga Elementary. This filled in the social void, and I was content with it.       I tried my best to improve my ",1
"60","ElliotRoger","Intentions","Hi. Elliot Rodger here. Well, this is my last video, it has all had to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of retribution, the day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all of you. For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, Ive been forced to endure an existence of loneliness,  ejection and unfulfilled desires all because girls have never been attracted to me. Girls gave their  affection, and sex and love to other men but never to me. Im 22 years old and Im still a virgin. Ive never even kissed a girl. Ive been through college for two and a half years, more than that actually, and Im still a virgin. It has been very torturous. College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and pleasure. Within those years, Ive had to rot in loneliness. Its not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me. I dont know why you girls arent attracted to me, but I will punish you all for it. Its an injustice, a crime, because . . . I dont know what you dont see in me. Im the perfect guy and yet you throw yourselves at these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentleman. I will punish all of you for it.  On the day of retribution Im going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB. And I will slaughter every spoiled, stuck-up, blond slut I see inside there. All those girls Ive desired so much, they would have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man if I ever made a sexual advance towards them  while they throw themselves at these obnoxious brutes. Ill take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one. The true alpha male.  Yes. After Ive annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I will take to the streets of Isla Vista and slay every single person I see there. All those popular kids who live such lives of hedonistic pleasures while Ive had to rot in loneliness for all these years. Theyve all looked down upon me every time I tried to go out and join them, theyve all treated me like a mouse. Well now I will be a god compared to you. You will all be animals. You are animals and I will slaughter you like animals. And I will be a god. Exacting my retribution on all those who deserve it. You do deserve it. Just for the crime of living a better life than me. All you popular kids, youve never accepted me, and now you will all pay for it. And girls, all I ever wanted was to love you, and to be loved by you. Ive wanted a girlfriend, Ive wanted sex, Ive wanted love, affection, adoration. You think Im unworthy of it. Thats a crime that can  never be forgiven. If I cant have you, girls, I will destroy you.  You denied me a happy life, and in turn, I will deny all of you life.  Its only fair. I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power, I would stop at nothing [points finger at camera] to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood. And rightfully so. You deserve to be annihilated and Ill give that to you. You never showed me any mercy and so I will show you none. Youve forced me to suffer all my life and now Ill force you all suffer. Ive waited a long time for this. Ill give you exactly what you deserve. All of you. All you girls who rejected me and looked down upon me and you know, treated me like scum while you gave yourselves to other men. And all of you men, for living a better life than me, all of you sexually active men, I hate you. I hate all of you. I cant wait to give you exactly what you deserve. Utter annihilation.",1

How everything is \nconnected yet separate. By experiencing the petty others actions, reactions, emotions, doings, \nand thoughts, he gets a mental picture of what, in his mind, is a cycle. \nExistence is a great hall, life is one of the rooms, death is passing thru the doors, & the ever-\nexistent compulsion of everything is the curiosity to keep moving down the hall, thru the \ndoors, exploring rooms, down this never-ending hall.

So, the dream directed \nmy mind into the social \'chart\' of the kid and the students in general, in which I just kind \nof got a broader social look in people; i.e. being able to \'put myself into other people\'s \nshoes\'. I worked and thought and came up with a moral that I really need to reach that kid \nand prevent anything bad from happening, because I don\'t want someone to have to deal \nwith the mentality that can develop from that.\nThe dream flashed to another dream, which was a type of mind probe in a way. I just felt \nlike I was being read. I was having to face my own flaws in a very disturbing and hostile \nstate of REM.\nI kind of woke up and still felt the alien type thing (Probably caused from human natural \nDMT from last sentence) glaring at me. It kind of had that \'snobby\' or arrogant type of \npersonality seen from some reports of aliens. While I woke up, that thing kind of faded \noff probably due to the release of DMT stopping.\nJust for reference, I haven\'t done DMT or LSD.

I don\'t see the \npoint in dishing out $30k a year just to get into college, only for most people to either \ndrop out or get a useless degree, or something they\'re not entirely interested in.\nI don\'t think everything should be free, but there\'s one thing that absolutely must be- \nEducation. Primary and Secondary school is free for students, which is excellent because \nevery human deserves the chance and the right to be educated.\nYet in college, most the time it\'s going into a huge room with a hundred other students, \ntaking notes of what the professor says, and then studying your ass off to try to actually \npass the class. A lot of times, the teachers aren\'t even good at teaching in the first place.\nYet in Elementary ~ High, you have teachers working their ass off, helping each student at \nthe rise of a hand.\nSo normally school only costs tax payers. You get all the help you need for free, during \nclass. You can fuck up all you want.\nCollege, you pay a FUCKLOAD of $$$ for, get shitty teachers, have to do everything \nyourself, and have a low chance of success.\nIn america, College is Bullshit!\nI can\'t believe it\'s been 8 whole years since then..

Benevolence, Politeness and \nselflessness are very admirable traits, but most women have barely evolved.\nMake a subconscious effort to be a leader; to be dominant. Reward them for good \nbehavior, make them reliant on you.

Us men cannot have any emotion, we have to be into \nsports and killing, and we have to be strong. Women are only expected to use up our \nresources and -- in a distant past, take care of the family unit.\nModern women, however, don\'t raise their kids. I know my little brother\'s best friend lived \nin a household with a single mother. She was 250+ pounds, made him do all of the chores \nand cleaning, and ignored the two youngest children. Those kids have spent most of their \ntime playing video games instead of being taught values and morality. They will not have \nanything to reflect back on when they are older, and it is likely they will grow up weaker \nphysically and mentally than would be.\n3 Timothy McVeigh: Oklahoma City bombing, 1995; Anders Breivik: mass attacks in Norway, 2011.2014\n2014\n2014\n2014\n2014\n2014WWW.SCHOOLSHOOTERS.INFO Peter Langman, Ph.D. Version 1.0 (7 July 2020) 13That single mother?

If she married one of the nerds / nice guys, I\'d guarantee the \nentire family would be better off.\nWomen ignore and bully nice guys, and leave them to be rather miserable and rejected \nfor their lifetime. The intellectuals and benevolent people usually never get laid and \nget bullied well into adulthood. It doesn\'t really change after high school. Yet retards, \ngearheads, and douchebags get rewarded for their idiocies.\nThis is evidence enough that women are stupid. Dish in the constant nagging, gold-\ndigging, manipulating, hypersexuality, cheating and so many other aspects of the typical \n\'liberated\' woman, and anyone who doesn\'t have their head in their ass will agree that \ncivilization has a major moral crisis going on.\nAnd yet for what I have just said, I would be shunned by most people, even though it\'s the \nreality. P.C. degenerates are destroying society.\nI\'m against gay marriage because I do not want them to experience the soul crushing pain \nthat follows a long time committed relationship, just for 99% of them to fail.

He had \na upper-middle class family (200,000 / yr ) .. which confuses me as to why they would \nmove to this ugly, redneck rundown desert shithole of a town.. Anyways, he fucking kills \nhimself from all the bullshit from the town.\nI usually take daily walks, ever since 2014 when I stopped being as much as a shut-\nin. I casually talk to a few people here and there. I remember having a few lengthy \nconversations with folks, and when it was relevant to the subject being discussed, I \nprobably brought up the story of the kid a few times.\nYou know what they all said about that kid? He was a sinner and deserved it. Those \narent my words, they\'re the words of the redneck shitheads here. They\'re all mormon \npsychopaths addicted to tobacco and meth driving shitty pickup trucks from the 70s.\nYou know the movie naoplean dynamtie? Imagine that but with 50x more hostility in the \nrednecks, and all the scenery replaced by ugly light-tan wasteland covered with weeds \neverywhere.\nMy point? you cant blame that kid for killing himself. I\'m not supporting his decision, \nbecause most suicidal people are usually good people at heart. Most victims of suicide \nARE NOT REMEMBERED. I\'ve spoken to the parents of this child and inspired them \nto do what the parents of Ryan Halligan did and perhaps make a memorial site and do \npublic speaking on behalf of the bloke.\nNow with that being said, the bloke still had great parents and a nice house, but it\'s not \nlike that would really counter the fact that the people we\'re surrounded with are thrice as \nscary as southerners.\nWeise lived far away from a lot of american civilization in a fucking rez. You all know his \nlife story by now so it should be of no surprise why he was so dark and disturbed.\nTo wrap this tl;dr post up.. The reason why most modern mass murderers exist is because \nthey know for a fact that suicide alone would just leave them forgotten forever. But if they \npull the trigger and take out some random people with them, the media will make them \nthe talk of (not only the town) but the nation and perhaps even the world.\nRed Lake was on-par with columbine, and yet only got 1% as much attention. You know \nwhy? Because they were all native americans- minorities. Even still, a lot of people still \nfaintly remember it 10 years later. Imagine if weise never went postal. Maybe a dozen \nwould\'ve known about it enough to turn a glance his way for a moment, maybe his \ngrandpa would care.\nIt\'s the killer\'s fault for the tragedy, but society\'s fault for making the killers.\nAs for anyone thinking violent video games cause real life violence..\n[Regarding a post about Jeffrey Weise:]\nThanks for a decent nonbiased post that actually contributed to the thread bro.\nLike I usually say, for this specific case (Red Lake) it\'s hard not to feel incredibly sorry for 12 May 2015WWW.SCHOOLSHOOTERS.INFO Peter Langman, Ph.D. Version 1.0 (7 July 2020) 44the bloke. Given his life circumstances, very few would\'ve overcome those challenges and \nhorrible experiences to become a normal person.\nIf I had a decent family, great genetics and didnt live in a desert shithole state, I would\'ve \nhad a future and a positive outlook on life too. Even small changes like a different location \naround here would\'ve had massive effects on my psyche.\nWhen that guy had his dad kill himself, a drunk abusive shithead for a mom (Who \nbecame disabled for life due to a car crash) and was forced to move to a indian reservation \nyou cant blame him for being violent and suicidal.\nLike I said, I live near the largest native rez in the country. Even 20 miles from the border \nin a small quiet town, there\'s still lots of corruption, suicidal people (a 13 year old boy \nkilled himself a while ago) and no real jobs. We\'re mostly white, if that says anything. \nEven generic american whites are living in 3rd world conditions out here.\nI\'m not going to troll or be evil. Mass murder is inexcusable and absolutely never \ncommendable.\nAmerican and most western civilization isnt even really civil. You\'re on your own out here. \nFew friends will back you up, most people\'s families are close-minded and horrible, and \nwe\'re no longer the great country we say we are, we\'re 2nd-class compared to much of \nwestern europe. Unless you\'re making 250,000$ / yr as a family unit, you are no longer \nthe fabled middle class of the 20th century.\nLots of people say they help the depressed /suicidal, but very few seek to help them. Hell, \ndepression isnt constant sadness, at least once you hit adulthood. If weise stayed alive \nanother 5 years before commiting suicide he would\'ve gone absolutely insane.

When you\'re born it goes \nslowly yet you don\'t even comprehend it; when you are finally able to see it when you\'re \na young child, it flows slowly and peacefully. When you\'re on the verge of adolescence, \nit begins to pick up pace and it quickly becomes difficult to keep track of the rippling in \nthe water. When you hit an adult age (around 16), you\'ll find it going at a dozen times the \nspeed that it went by as a child. Eventually, it becomes impossible to keep track of the \ndetails.\nJust how much time has passed?

I remember 2007~09 like it was yesterday, and \nyet I\'m starting to lose much of my memory of that time period. Let\'s take a look at how \nmuch time has passed;\n2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015. So 11 entire years have \npassed that I\'ve lived in this state. More than half of my life has been spent in one of the \nworst states in the entire country, and the USA is one of the largest nations in the world. \nWhen you look at the list of years, 2005 is barely that far apart from 07, and yet 05 and \n06 were probably the worst years I\'ve went through. In less than a year now, I\'ll begin to \nexperience life a decade in the future from my heyday. A decade, in seemingly the blink of \nan eye. It\'s crazy.\nHell, as I type this, it\'s already been 4 years since I\'ve left school. Mass Effect 3 is almost \n4 years old already! Skyrim is already at that point.

My loyal companion, a fat, muscular golden cat \nnamed Piggy has been 6ft under for 4 1/2 years now as well. Crazy..\nNow.. looking into the future, I see no hope. The middle class continues to die, more \namericans go on welfare or poverty, the rich grow in power, suicide and mass murder \nskyrockets, USA loses it\'s power, etc. My predictions aren\'t even hypothetical; they\'re \nalready happening and have been for decades. \nSociety has also been corrupted and decayed. Nowadays it\'s not even uncommon for frikin \nPre-teens to lose their v-cards. It\'s disgusting. Most males are backstabbing betas, or \nalpha assholes. It\'s rare to find a good friend nowadays.

I just got 3 cavities left to patch up and my teeth will be alright, but enough about this \nshit. \nFor the last few weeks, I\'ve been playing the f*** out of Grand Theft Auto IV. It\'s just \nabout 8 years old now, but I\'m still finding new things every time I play. I must confess \nthat despite now owning GTA 5 (due to a friend gifting me it on steam), I\'ve never beat it. \nUp until I was gifted it, I never even touched the game. Despite the fact that 5 is superior \nto 4 in most ways, I still find more enjoyment in GTA 4; 280+ hours of it to be precise. \nSuffice to say, I\'m addicted to Liberty City, and all the fucked up freaks and events that \ntake place within this virtual world.\nThrough the near-decade long time I\'ve spent on IV, I mostly frequented the southern \nhalf of the eastern borough, and downtown \'manhatten\' and the central park. Lately, \nI\'ve been exploring the smaller obscure islands and finding a lot of shit. I modded some \nhealth / armor regen scripts to make the game a hell of a lot less tedius, but practically \ndoubled the damage of the weapons and vastly expanded the range of them; the sawed \noff shotgun is capable of downing someone over 200m from you (although it is VERY \nunlikely due to the spread)\nI\'ve been going on GTA 4\'s internet and browsing these sites. I\'ve found shit I never read \nbefore. GTA 4 is on par with TES 4 on the amount of shit you can still discover. I was \nreading blogs in game and legit threw up from one of them. It was basically some ugly \nfat feminist furfag cunt talking about her perverted sexual activity with someone else and \ndousing each other with dishwasher liquids. I\'m just sitting here thinking..

Chad \nand Chloe weren\'t entirely fucking brainless zombies addicted to their screens. They\'re \nstill normies though, so they\'re still absolute scum of the earth who deserve nothing but \na few stabs into their jugular vein. What I\'m trying to show you is, the world\'s a different \nplace than it was when I was growing up. We\'re seeing Global warming finally having \nsome serious effects.

However, look how the gun-free-countries \noften fare in homicide rates compared to somewhere like Germany, Norway, Finland or \nSwitzerland, where guns are relatively common and purchaseable. It\'s the people, not the \nlaws, people.\nMost of school is a fucking nightmare equivalent to prison if you\'re even an iota unique \nor individualistic. This creates a false mentality of what the world is (the real world is still \nshit but nothing compared to school) which causes the already mentally fragile bullied \noutcasts to become even more alienated and unstable.\nMass shooters / school shooters are given (or at one point, were, before it became an \nevery-3-second occurance) massive amounts of fame, fangirls, news coverage, etc- \nattention they were usually neglected IRL- or rather, the attention they receive is often \nnegative in nature.\nSo what would a tl;dr sensible method of reducing the amount of school shootings be? I \ngot a solution and nobody\'s gun rights or freedom of expression has to be fucking taken \naway by you leftist twats or right wing religious nutjobs.\n1. Actually do something about bullying. We don\'t have to turn our schools into \n1984-esque nanny/prison states even more than they already are.

I brought some audio cassette tapes so I can explain to the police and my parents about why I did it. i plan to commit suicide on either april 20th or april 21st. april 20th is an obvious choice, for it is the seventh anniversary of the columbine high school massacre. however, i want to see the documentaries that they will show on the history channel. if is there, then i will wait until he leaves. then i will ocmmit the act. i will send anna an email telling her how much i love and care for her. i will tell her that i would pass by her house, and that i named my shotgun after her and the m-16 rifle in basic training. i will also call and confess to him what i will do. i have to do this. ever since that . alvaro catillo rest in peace born died cause of death self inflicted gunshot to the head via entrance to the  dear journal, well i gave arlene a complete makeover. i turned her into eric's shotgun. i sawed off the barrel and stock of the shotgun with a hacksaw. it took a lot less time than i thought it would. i taped the butt of the shotgun with duct tape. now i just have to test her. i also took bomb apart, and i know how to make more. i must reserve the motel for denver today. arlene looks so beautiful now. i also ordered a pistol belt and three ammuniition pouches from the internet. everything's falling into place at last. today i also saw a program on the history channel about charles whitman, the texas sniper. he was an ex marine who killed his wife, mother, and a number of other people on august 1, 1966. this year will mark the 40th anniversary. i will buy black cargo pants and black boots online to complete the uniform that eric was wearing on april 20th 1999. i am feeling very depressed these days. i drown my sadness and depression with work, cleaning, and movies. still it just keeps coming back, i am a tv junkie. i have been addicted to movies and television ever since i was born. i just became interested in rated r movies when i was 7 years old, around the same time i was shown pornography. i am having sexual fantasies these days and fantasies of being held  hostage by an evili twin brother. i assume that he represents my dark side. i can't even cry! the anti depressant i am taking doesn't seem to be working. on august 29th my depression will end permanently. i just want to die i don't want to live like this anymore. i have endured 10 years . in one week i will finally be dead. i am just putting the finishing touches on my autobiography it is in my computer in microsoft word  under the name columbine. i have almost everything ready. i just need more ammo and i need to go to church before i begin. i cannot wait. i wish i could tell my family but i can't. i miss anna. today she starts her sophomore year. i will always think about her. she is so beautiful. i don't deserve her though. i do not deserve anyone. if i was mentally well, maybe i could've told her my feelings. i do not feel sorry for scaring her. i know i am sick. what do you do with sick people like me. can't change you have to sacrifice the,. bad things could happen. we have to learn to sacrifice ourselves. i need to sleep now. goodnight. today is the big day for operation columbine. it is time that the world be reminded of columbine. i will die today. i just killed my father. it felt good. he is finally dead. i do feel a little remorse. still he is finally with god and tony. i loved my father, i hesitated but i finally did it. god be with him.

"86","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","I didnt understand this when I was younger, but Ive always had an immense hatred for 
culture. I consider culture to be delusional values which humans mindlessly coerce onto 
each other, spreading it no differently than any other disease. I previously sought to eliminate 
my cultural values to the greatest extent that I could. Through this I expected to gradually 
discover values of an inner self which could be reconciled with this society, so that I could 
engage in activities and pursue goals which would lead to happiness.
Eventually I got to a point where I had sufficiently freed myself from what I called cultural 
values when I analyzed all of the things which brought me happiness and all the goals which 
I wanted to pursue, I realized that absolutely everything about those things that appealed to 
me was entirely a consequence of my cultural infection.
Formerly, I had rejected some aspects of culture while accepting other ones, and merely 
not calling them cultural as if those values were somehow transcendent and fine. It was at 
that point that I realized that there is no such thing as an inner self. Any sense of self is a 
delusional cultural construct. I realized that cultural infections were the sole source of any 
possible value beyond base values. For a while, I believed that happiness could be attained if culture could theoretically be eradicated and anarchic primitivism were to take 
hold. Replace all instances of technology with culture in the analytic sections of Industrial 
Society and Its Future and you basically have my mentality at the time regarding the pernicious effects of culture.
The problem was that Id not been addressing what happiness is. Happiness is merely the 
fulfilment of value, I recognized that if cultural values were eliminated, the happiness which 
results from their fulfilment would not be needed because happiness becomes an unnecessary and incoherent concept when it is removed from its concept  context. A common 
theme in my quasi-anarcho-primitivist thought at the time is that non-base values exist only 
as a consequence of cultural infections and impede on the happiness which results from 
the fulfilment of feral values. As if my feral self is  in short metaphysically the real 
me, whose soul had been devoured by the culturally constructed impostor of the self. But 
my feral self was also an impostor. Just as I realized that I could eliminate non-base values 
and have no need for the happiness which resulted from their fulfilment, I could eliminate 
base-values and have no need for the happiness which resulted from their fulfilment.
It was not only the disease of culture that had been plaguing me all  all along, it was the 
disease of life itself. I was not and I am not in some existential crisis, Ive never had 
the slightest problem with the obvious nonexistence of free will, objective purposes, and 
all of that. I have always been entirely psychologically capable of accepting my own subjective values and goals, even though I know they are consummately inconsequential, and it 
doesnt bother me at all. 
The problem is not that I seek meaning and cannot find it. The problem is that I do feel 
immense meaning, and so does everyone else who is alive. Meaning is an abstract interpretation of value which exists only because of life. Just as I sought to eradicate the delusional 
values which culture infected me with, the final solution is the termination of my life, to rid 
myself of all value. The solution cannot be to embrace some aspect of life, as if the erosion 
of delusions is the cause of this. Life is what urgently caused me to have value, and changing 
my life will never do anything but create different delusions than the ones I already have. 
Unfortunately, as of right now I lack the discipline to pursue my death  death and to rid 
myself of the values which delude me, even though I recognize the solution to life is death. 
But I do commend others who do commit suicide. They have freed themselves from culture, 
life, and all value. They have freed themselves from themselves.",1
"87","AdamLanza","Ramble","I suppose I should add a video to my channel where Im not reading something which I wrote before the video, and instead just ramble about ... basically whatever comes to mind, so that I seem like less of a robot. And I I havent slept very recently, so Im probably going to ramble incoherently, but Im  Im not excusing my rambling, by really saying that though because I always ramble. But anyway, I was just recently thinking about all of this it gets better nonsense, you 
know, with, with um, pertaining to the teenagers being bullied into committing suicide. 
And, uh, just the concept of bullying in general. And Ive, in my life, I dont think Ive ever 
conventionally been bullied. I cant really remember a single instance, but its, it just seems 
so ironic, all of this nonsense. Eve-even though I wasnt bullied in a conventional sense, I was 
bullied in the normal cultural sense, which everyone is bullied in. And when people speak 
about that, it ” it gets better nonsense, they say it in the context of, Well our children are 
being bullied, what can we do to create an environment in which they can thrive? And that 
seems like such a blatant contradiction to me because its really demonstrating the true bul-
lying thats going on, and that bullying is what every child is subjected to. The imposition 
of cultural values. And the only reason why they oppose . . . um, the conventional sense of 
bullying is because it interferes with their cultural imposition of value. And . . . its just, eh, 
children are constantly bullied in every sense of the term, when it comes to their upbringing.
Like, one instance I recently remembered, this . . . heh, this isnt I guess, a very good representation of what Im talking about, but I remember when I was about ten years old, and at 
the end of the day in elementary school we would get into lines and go from room to room, 
to gather the kids for the right bus. And I remember that, when I was in the line, we would 
get to a section of portable rooms which werent connected to the main hallway so we would 
wait at that door which leads to them. And . . . um, the students, from there, would come join 
the line, and I remembered that usually I would, I dont, I dont really remember what I was 
doing but I would frantically signal to them as if there were some emergency. Um, I wasnt 
serious, I was . . . I dont know what I was doing, I was just bored I guess.
And anyway, one day I looked through the window from the door leading to the portable 
classrooms, and I saw that the principal of the school was speaking to someone over there. 
And I thought, Oh well, I cant goof around when shes there, so I said out loud to the people, 
um, to the other students that were at the line there with me, I said, Oh the principal is 
there, well, I dont care, and by that time I just thought I was going to just, flap around, 
just motion as if there were some emergency, anyway, just fooling around. And 
the vice principal happened to be standing behind me, hearing me say, Oh the principals 
there, oh I dont care, and she said the statement, You should care, as if it were . . . 
eh, something very insightful, and wise. And even though she misunderstood the context 
of what I was saying, its ignoring that, just, looking at that statement, You SHOULD care,
and that really . . . is a representation of, what childhood is. Its children saying, I dont care, 
I dont want your values, I dont want to live, and adults constantly saying, You should care 
about values, you should choose culture, you should choose life, and thats what parenting 
and childhood and education and all of that is. Its just adults bullying children into accept-
ing their values. So how can you possibly criticize people for mocking the homosexuals and 
bullying them in some sense, when youre the ones whore incessantly bullying children? 
And, in that vein, um, heh, man, and the children, they grow up to do the same exact thing. 
And they just senselessly propagate these cultural memes . . . forever. It just keeps going on, 
they keep bullying each other, and theres no point to any of it.
",1
"88","AdamLanza","Ramble","And this kind of ties into an interest I have, which is . . . well, heh, um . . . basically the way in 
which society treats pedophiles. And before I go any further, I should say, Im not a pedophile, 
Ive never knowingly had any contact with any pedophiles . . . at all. And, just strictly an aca-
academic interest in the subject, but . . . it . . . this whole bullying theme, its remarkable how 
they can say that homosexual teenagers are being bullied, when any discrimination which 
homosexuals face is infinitely more insignificant when compared to the discrimination which pedophiles are faced face against. Um, I mean, first off everyone 
hates you, youre subject to innumerable hate crimes just right off the bat, but if youre ever 
known to have engaged in a pedophilic relationship with a child, youre instantly imprisoned 
for prolonged periods. Youre put on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. You are brutalized in prison, and people actually celebrate that as if its a good thing. And then if 
youre lucky enough to escape prison with your life, youre on that sex offenders registry or 
possibly castrated, you are tracked with a Gps device in some instances, and . . . the-there are 
just, so many issues pedophiles face, and everyone seems to think that its not a problem at 
all, its somehow justified that theyre treated in that manner.
And . . . and, you have to develop such extensive arguments just to refute that delusion, that 
somehow having sex with children is harmful to them innately. When, Im . . . Ive written 
an essay thats already ten thousand and, Im nowhere near finished and its already ten 
thousand words long with eight thousand words and notes that I have to add. Itll probably 
end up over twenty-five thousand words and its just refuting this simple nonsense. And 
basically, all that it really boils down to, is that children arent harmed by having sex, the 
reason why pedophilia is opposed is because it combines an atavistic cultural opposition 
to sex with the undermining of authority of adults who relegate children to the property of 
status. Uh, eh, sorry, to the status of their property. Ive . . . typed that sentence, or forms of 
it, so many times, and its really all that it is. Its just that youre undermining their author-
ity to impose their cultural values on children, and of course when you interfere with that 
process, people are going to react violently. And its . . . not innately harmful for children 
to have sex, its . . . so absurd, Ive never seen a valid argument stating as such. And, um, 
really thats all that culture is. Its just the imp the reason why Im interested in this topic 
of pedophilia, is not because I have any ties to it, at all. Its because it really represents what 
culture is. Its a bunch of lies which exist to propagate itself. Infecting countless children 
for countless generations and just . . . continuing to perpet-perpetuate, heh, I promise in 
the future Ill make some videos about pedophilia Im not just gonna leave it on that note. 
Um. My . . . arguments are much more refined than what Ive just stated, but really its just 
a bunch of nonsense.",1
"89","AdamLanza","Ramble","And . . . why do . . . people even people seem to think that theyre doing their children a favor, 
when theyre imposing values on them. Theyre thinking, My values are so great that a child 
needs to be brought up with them, they, um, they they dont really realize what theyre 
doing. And, first off Im talking about people who actually choose to have children, instead 
of the Oh whoops the condom broke, guess I just raped the soul of our offspring, instead 
Im talking about those people who um intend on having children and intend on giving them 
a quote better life than they had.
These people experienced what they consider to be trauma when they were children, saying, 
Oh my family was too poor to provide for us or Oh my family somehow abused us, and 
because of that they think that they can do their children a favor by changing their behavior 
when having their children. But youre not doing your children any favors, youre not, its 
like they think that youre that somehow that process of parenting is progressing towards 
some enlightenment, but its, its not doing that at all, the only reason why you would want 
to do that with your children is because, not because youre being selfless, youre being 
selfish. Youre trying to remedy your own psychological baggage. I mean, the children have 
nothing to do with it, they dont exist, they dont, they arent subjected to whatever you were 
subjected to. Its, uh, I dont even know.
You dont do your children a favor by raising them in any way, all that youre doing is impos-
ing values onto them and theyre going to have to do the same thing to their children, to fix 
their baggage and all of that nonsense. You think that youre progressing toward something, 
and Im not saying that youre not progressing, that youre somehow deviating from some 
progression or that youre going in circles. Im not saying that at all, youre not going in 
circles, youre not progressing, youre, um, youre not doing anything. Theres no movement at all, youre youre stuck in the zeroth dimension and Im stuck in 
the zeroth dimension with no movement at all because thats the structure of life and thats 
what value demands, youre jusyoure not accomplishing anything by doing any of this, 
youre just trying to fulfill the values that youve been instilled with. And if you dont have 
children, you dont need to fulfill any of those values. Uh. Not sure where I should go right 
now, I mean, what I should talk about.
It really irritates me how people . . . they seem to say that, why should it be celebrated when 
a child is born? I think that you should say, um, Im so sorry for your loss whenever you 
hear that someone is pregnant. And its the same thing with suicide, I used to feel sorry for 
people who committed suicide, but I think they have the right idea.",1
"90","AdamLanza","Ramble","And now I commend them, I think that people should throw celebrations when someone 
commits suicide because . . . theyre able to escape this value trap. And . . . heh . . . I wish I were 
that determined, but Im still psychologically stuck in all of this, I probably wont be pursuing 
that any time soon, but Ive never heard a single good argument against suicide. [laughter] 
My favorite one is Its selfish to commit suicide! as if its somehow not selfish for those 
people to force that person to live who has already determined that life is not worth living, 
just so that they can fulfill their needs. Or rather their values, you dont need anything. But 
I guess in the vein of that whole, parenting thing, you imposing values onto your children 
to address your own . . . thats basically all that politics is, anyway. I used to enjoy reading, um, anything written by authors like . . . Proudhon, Kropotkin, espe-
cially Tolstoy, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Benjamin Tucker, basically any anarchist 
whether they are  they were individualists or collectivists, I enjoyed all of that, and it  I used 
to think that I was progressing toward something by learning about anarchist philosophy. 
But as if it were somehow anti-cultural, as if I were destroying some [archons?] of the mind. 
But I . . . I was doing no such thing, the only reason why I was ever interested in anarchist 
philosophy is because I felt . . . because of the experiences I had in my life, I felt as if I were 
hurt by the concept of authority. And if I had never been exposed to that concept, I wouldve 
never pursued any of this, anarchist philosophy. And thats basically an understatement of 
what I was thinking back then. But it, I guess the essence of it. And so thats all that politics 
is, people whove, because of the lives theyve lived have acquired certain values and they try 
to fulfill that by promoting their political agenda as if its . . . somehow progressing towards 
something, but its not, its just addressing your psychological baggage.
And its, its all complete nonsense. I wasnt anti-cultural in the sense that I thought I was 
getting beyond culture. I was  it was just counterculture. And thats basically, well thats 
basically all of life . . . and now Im getting into the incoherent stage. Um, anyway, 
people think that, Oh, well of course politics matters, because peoples rights need to be 
enforced, right? But thats not true because these rights are just another cultural abstrac-
tion. They . . . um, they  they dont exist at all. Um, basically, I  eh, they say that . . . you 
can somehow derive rights through some criteria, whatever that may be, or those may be, 
and I used to think that that were possible, in some sense. That doing those things were 
possible, but I  I and I used to believe in the concept of logical contradictions, but I was 
just misinterpreting the way in which logic was applied to determine rights. Such as, I used to think it was a contradiction for people to say . . . screensaver just came 
on, heh, um . . . thats going nowhere. Um, that it was a contradiction for people to say that 
bestiality somehow violated an animals rights and yet those same people, the same meat-
eaters, would advocate factory-farming. And they didnt think that violated animals rights, 
when how could you possibly say that having sex with an animal violates its rights but killing 
the animals not? It didnt make any sense to me, but I was just misinterpreting the way that 
they were using their so-called logic.",1
"91","AdamLanza","Ramble","They werent using their logic so that they could determine what rights existed, they were 
applying their logic so that they could determine how they could best fulfill their subjective 
values. So basically when they saw someone having sex with an animal, they thought, Ew, I 
dont like that, I should create a right by which an animal can be free from this so I can be 
free from that and then they say, Oh, bacon is tasty so therefore we should create property 
rights over animals and No, animals dont have a right to live because X.Y.Z., and you try 
to refute those assertions but its not those assertions upon which their argument is based. 
Its just based in the fulfilment of their subjective values and thats really all that rights are.
And heres another sentence I used to write all the time, or type all the time, but Ill try to get 
it right: Rights are just euphemisms for the use of violence against someone who deviates 
from the fulfilment of the subjective values of a group which has the capacity to kill, I think 
that basically describes it, and thats really all that it is. Its just a group with the capacity to 
kill who is coercing people into behaving in ways which allow the maximum fulfilment of 
their subjective values.
And mor-morality is similar . . . not identical, but similar. Um, morality doesnt exist and I dont 
mean morality is subjective, I mean moral statements have no validity, they are completely 
incoherent. Its, um . . . morality is basically just a cultural abstraction of subjective values, 
so people just select arbitrary values and then they say . . . an-and they duct-taped the-them 
together under  under the banner of moral language, and the-they say, My behavior is 
ethically or morally justified instead of saying My value is leading me to act in this way 
and thats all there is to th morality, theres really nothing more.
Oh man I just remembered, I guess I should comment on this whole race thing, with 
HeyRuka, HeyRuka and whatnot.4 I dont really understand why . . . if people like HeyRuka 
want to advocate segregation of races be so that they can, because they value those races, 
because they put value in those races value so much that they want . . . that value to prosper, 
in their own settings, if theyre so obsessed with the value I dont understand why they stop 
at ethnicity instead of some other category because, its quite obvious that even among eth-
nicities, their values are radically different so if they love value so much then I dont know 
why theyre focusing on race, I think . . . its probably just another abstraction that only, I 
dont want to spend time thinking about it because its so pointless.
And Im not saying that, um, we should encourage diversity and . . . Im not saying that we 
should segregate, because both intre-integration and segregation are nonsensical. Theyre 
just two systems under which culture prospers and we all lose. Theres really no difference 
between them. This ties into what I used to, sort of, my prior thinking, I used to address the 
issue of language being cultural. Oh man, I hate language so much, maybe Ill talk about that 
later. But I used to address the problem of language being cultural, by just saying, Oh um, 
Esperan worldwide implil-implementation of Esperanto should solve that problem it was 
such a trivial, um, way to deal with that, because I wasnt . . . all that, um, integration allows 
to happen is to  all that it does is kill competing viruses while  to let one virus prosper. ",1
"92","AdamLanza","Ramble","Theres really no difference between integration and segregation, its just the propagation of culture under different systems. And about language . . . oh man, I have a special place in 
my heart for language because its the primary method by which cultural values are coerced 
onto other people.
And you cant, its like the wheezing of someone with tuberculosis. Its a symptom of it, 
its also the method by which it propagates to other victims, and theres nothing you can 
do about it. Youre for  um, forever stuck with this, language, all these abstractions . . . but 
here Im going back into my, my anarcho-quasi I should say quasi-anarcho-primitivist 
ideology when really, its not culture thats the problem, its value thats the problem. Its 
the structure of value itself, its not only cultural value, its fler-feral value too. Its all a part 
of the same nonsense . . . and sort of similar, to the whole race debacle, is the Efilists,5 um, 
even though Im adamantly opposed to the structure of life, I . . . I differ from the Efilists in 
several regards, and the main issue is their . . . um, they invoke these cultural abstractions 
like rights and morality to further their ideology. And, Im not appealing to anything, Ive 
recognized that theres nothing transcendent about my ideas, theyre just a consequence of 
the life Ive lived, but its kind of like how Jay Sender[?] said, there . . . there are so many people 
from different backgrounds who come to the same conclusion about antinatalism, about 
the structure of life, its um . . . ah, not appealing to anything, you can just look for yourself 
at the structure of life and you can see, its  its just like how Gary6 says its, he says that, 
the simplest way, its just a need that you did, its just a need that need not exist. And thats 
all that life is, and its so easy to see that. That youre just, fulfilling these values which . . . 
theres, which have no reason to exist. And I dont need to say its immoral[?] to fulfill that, 
I just say . . . its ridiculous according to my own standards, and apparently the standards of 
many other people. I mean Im not really sure I can communicate this, maybe its not even 
possible to communicate this, because of the structure of life. Because I cant free myself 
from value and still communicate that I hate value.
Its my value which leads me to hating value. [sigh] And another thing about the Efilists is 
that a lot of them seem to think, that is, eh, its, that its possible for there to be . . . its pos-
sible for there to be an instance under which it would be a good idea to propagate life, that 
if suffering were abolished tomorrow, that it would be okay to bring new lives into the world 
or to live your current life. But I dont really focus on suffering, at least not directly I focus on 
really, value itself, thats the problem. Even if there were Paradise tomorrow, and there were 
no suffering forever in the future, I would still be advocating this position because I . . . you 
can sum me up in one sentence: I have a vendetta against value. So instead of an Efilist Im 
more of a . . . eulavist.7 Eh, I only oppose life because life is the source of value and its value 
that I really hate. And, well, I guess that just says it all: I have a vendetta against value. And 
I guess thats a good place to finish my video, I mean I basically support the Efilists because 
I do hate life and value, but um . . . its just that I have several problems with them . . . and 
also the same applies to Gary there are a lot of things I disagree with him about but listening 
to his rants are kind of my idea of pornography. Its just fun to listen to.",1
"93","AdamLanza","Ramble","Oh, and speaking about pornography, if anyone comments on this video, Im sure that ninety 
percent of them will be about the whole pedophilia thing, and I just want to emphasize I 
am not a pedophile, I dont know any pedophiles, its just an academic interest. And if any 
of you, eh, pedo-phobic um, inclined individuals want to comment about this, Id like to hear some unique arguments affirming the position that children having sex is innately 
harmful, because its been a really long time since Ive found a unique argument advocating 
that position. So . . . if you can, try to add some of those in the comments, but . . . um, until 
then, thanks for listening and maybe someday in the future Ill . . . I will definitely in the 
future make some videos about pedophilia and elaborate on my position, but also someday 
in the future maybe Ill add another one of these rambling videos, depending on how well 
this comes out. I should listen to it and probably think oh that, about myself, Oh that guys 
such a liar, just listen to his voice, listening to his intonation, hes obviously a pedophile! 
And who knows? . . . Maybe I am.",1
"94","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","Or rather, activist antinatalism, efilism, eulavism  call it whatever you 
want. The point is, theres no need to even bring suffering into the picture because even eternal 
utopia doesnt change what The Good and the good are.
 I should have elaborated on what I meant by this video, but it -was- at light speed. This is directed 
toward the people who say things like, Extinction?! But without humans, there will be no art; there 
will be no nobility; there will be no kindness; there will be no goodness.
Goodness is the fulfilment of value; value exists only in life. If there is no life, there is no 
value. And thus, goodness becomes an entirely irrelevant concept.",1
"95","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","So, I did that so that they would say, Wow this kid is fucked up, Id better not mess him up 
anymore. And . . . Ive, it, uh . . . subordination disgusts me. One of the most grating things 
I can hear is My parents raised me to believe that or My parents always told me that, I 
Its  I had to cut back to this because Im trying to think of how I can express this. I, 
you hear things like I dont need to spank my children because therere other methods of 
discipline available, and I used to think that it could be possible to have children and not 
discipline them, because I perceived values at potentially having some degree of validity, and 
I would think why do you need to coerce a child into behaving in certain ways when you can 
use reason? But you cant use reason because culture, there, there is no reason involved, 
cultural values are not reasonable. Culture, the only way that culture can spread is through 
coercion, and so thats why parents, even egalitarian ones, focus on the word discipline
because theres no other way to go about spreading these lies because children will instantly 
reject them. A child can see that all of this is nonsense, and thats why they go through this 
terrible twos stage, when theyre toddlers theyre incessantly miserable and its . . . its children 
dont, offspring dont naturally rebel against their parents like that.
Um, you dont see chimpanzee toddlers freaking out about their . . . they have scuffles, but 
they dont have this rebellion against their parents. And the reason why this rebellion exists 
in humans is because this cultural infection is being involved, theyre trying to rebel against 
this indoctrination process but of course, they always end up ca succumbing to it in the end 
and no longer see how delusional it is, and even still I . . . I dont entirely see how delusional 
I am, because I still have this notion that even though I nominally recognize that its false, 
I, I still have  I still operate under this belief that its possible for value, different values to 
be more valid than other values.
And thinking about this response video caused me to remember that a while ago I saw a 
documentary about bonobo chimps being taught language. Basically, theyre being indoctrinated into accepting culture and Ive seen some . . . immensely gory shockumentaries, 
but they were Barney compared to the horror that was in this documentary, and in all of 
the videos you can find on YouTube about apes being taught things. Um . . . Ill link to the 
specific video Im talking about, but the entire thing was . . . horrible. But I remember two 
particular scenes, there was one where this bonobo chimp was excited and it hopped onto 
a dog, and one of the prison guards um . . . was, um . . . bullying it, saying, Bad, bad, bad, 
bad continuously, it was like a nightmare and the . . . you could just tell the chimp wasnt 
recognizing that what it did was wrong, it was being instilled with this belief that it was bad, 
and its . . . one of there was this other scene where, it mightve been the same chimp but 
Im not sure. This bonobo chimp was trying to be, they were try the prison guards were 
trying to teach this chimp language and the chimp, they spend their entire lives in this prison 
complex and these aliens are trying to coerce these stupid things onto them and they have 
no idea whats going on. ",1
"96","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","All that they know is that theyre being forced into doing things. And this chimp, um, snapped and, because of all of this, the circumstances of its life, and it 
started attacking one of the prison guards . . . it um, it kicked her, I think, and she proceeded 
to chase it around shouting at it, bullying it, trying to intimidate it, and the . . . the poor chimp 
was terrified and if you want to understand why I hate culture, just watch these videos, those 
two scenes were among the most horrible things Ive seen in my life because it embodies 
what I went through and embodies what every single other human goes through thats 
exposed to culture, and its the saddest thing imaginable. Just. watch these YouTube videos 
about apes being indoctrinated and you can just see the sorrow and that sorrow is culture, 
theres nothing more to it, its horrible. I wish I could be indifferent but I am still affected by the solution 
that life is something worth retaliating against Well, that is because you overestimate . . . 
the extent to which there is culture. You think that your own values are culture, are culture induced, in fact they arent, those would be from you. But how do you distinguish that? As 
you tried to do, you tried to do sorta like a Descartes thing where you sort of went into the 
basement, What are my values and how do these relate to society, and tried to figure it 
out that way. Where I had sufficiently freed myself from what I called cultural values when I analyzed all of the things which brought me happiness and all the goals which 
I wanted to pursue, I realized that absolutely everything about those things that appealed to 
me was entirely a consequence of my cultural infection. Uh, no, not a cultural infection, that results in your genetics, really.
Formerly, I had rejected some aspects of culture while accepting other 
ones, and merely not calling them cultural. Well, why did you accept them? Same reason that people of the 
Bible say, Oh yeah I like that, I dont like that,well why are they like that? Maybe its because they resonate with it, so how is that from culture when its from you resonating with 
something else? Thats cause I realize . . .Thats from YOU, what is the loud self without others? Everything 
self, everything who, is a relation of you, to someone else. Can you find any spot, anything, 
anywhere, where its not you in relation to someone else? You might say oh I write characters in a book,well thats you playing and experimenting with yourself in relation to others, 
with yourself. So that simply putting it on a mental level. I dont think thats necessarily true. Theres a huge part of what people call 
the self but . . . there are two selves that I can identify. Theres the cultural self and theres 
the feral self. And . . . I think there is a real distinction between the two, I would . . . the feral 
self, I would call that which . . . genetically exists independent from whatever memes the 
creature might be exposed to. So the pleasure that you get from drinking water or climbing 
trees, the pleasure that a feral child would get is feral, it has nothing to do with culture. That 
. . . um, cultural, that cultural self is that which results from enculturation, it values that are 
created which do not exist independent from that cultural exposure. ",1
"97","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","People do have, independently have some degree of personalities and you can see that in 
animals, and you can take me for instance . . . Iâ€™ve always been a compulsive organizer, and 
I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s cultural because I exhibited that behavior at an extremely young age. So, 
when Iâ€™m in the process of making this video, I watched your video once, thought about it, 
watched it a second time, thought about it, and I was watching it the third time while I was 
typing out the points that I wanted to respond to.
And then when I finished, I rearranged those points and took the most relevant ones and 
then, now Iâ€™m responding to those and Iâ€™ll insert your um . . . points, and Iâ€™m going about 
this in the . . . heh, compulsively organized way because I â€” I feel compulsion that I canâ€™t 
respond unless I do it in this way.
And I think that compulsion has nothing to do with culture, but the reason Iâ€™m making this 
YouTube video at all is entirely cultural. If . . . If I were a feral child, I . . . I would not need to 
fulfill this desire to make this YouTube video, but because Iâ€™ve been exposed to this concept 
of YouTube videos, I thus need to fulfill it. And I go about fulfilling it in my own way, but 
the reason why Iâ€™m fulfilling it at all is entirely cultural. So, my genetics affect the way I deal 
with these values but the values exist entirely because of culture. And a feral child doesnâ€™t 
. . . have a desire to write or read intricately designed novels, it, that desire does not exist 
at all but being exposed to culture would um instill that desire into them, and they would 
subsequently need to fulfill it. And the same applies to everything cultural and thatâ€™s my 
point about the distinction between cultural values and feral values. A feral child would be 
happy drinking water and climbing trees. Interaction is not necessarily cultural, the way that I view an ant colony, I 
donâ€™t think that ants are remotely cultural even though they form these organized societies. 
And, um, theyâ€™re, theyâ€™re, theyâ€™re not taught . . . theyâ€™re not exposed to memes which 
results in their behavior, theyâ€™re behaving in the ways they do because as far as I know theyâ€™re 
. . . responding to certain types of scents at certain frequencies, and itâ€™s like . . . um, needing 
to drink water. They say, â€œIâ€™m thirsty and Iâ€™m going to take this action to fulfill that thirstâ€ 
and I donâ€™t need to be taught that Iâ€™m thirsty, I, I just know it. And thatâ€™s the way that ants 
operate, and thatâ€™s how their societies emerge. Theyâ€™re not . . . they arenâ€™t instilled with this 
culture, and . . . that feral child whoâ€™s drinking water and climbing trees, he, he, if he werenâ€™t 
exposed to anyone else, he would have a desire for social interaction.
That desire itself is not cultural and . . . if he were to . . . like apes in a jungle, the apes, they 
have these very, very, very undeveloped cultures. But most of their interaction is based off 
of feral values, so Iâ€™ve . . . thereâ€™s this small cultural aspect to their interaction but itâ€™s mostly 
feral. Um, theyâ€™re fulfilling their feral values, they donâ€™t need to be taught that they want 
to interact, they just do. The way someone just drinks. And culture can satisfy feral values, 
thatâ€™s where it gets a little confusing, because making this video . . . it can be perceived as, 
me making this video can be perceived as trying to fulfill a desire for social interaction. ",1
"98","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","But the culture doesnt allow it to happen, it subverts the process by which I would 
naturally fulfill that value. This because Ive been exposed to this culture, I fulfill that value by making this video, and this videos just a surrogate, its not the social interaction 
itself. If we were in a jungle somewhere, I, I wouldnt be making this video to you, and I 
wouldnt have the desire to make this video to you. I would stroke your hair and longfully 
gaze into your eyes, or whatever it is that feral humans do.
So, my point is that culture is the proverbial thug who breaks your limbs and gives you 
a crutch. Culture doesnt fulfill values, it creates the need to fulfill values and it subverts 
the natural processes by which you would fulfill those values. Thats why I used the disease 
metaphor, culture I, I know its needlessly inflammatory, but I think it is kind of an accurate description, even if you arent paying attention to those cute little comparisons like 
how language is like the wheezing of someone with tuberculosis and all of those little things. 
Language, I mean, culture doesnt solve anything, it  it latches onto someone, and it creates 
the need to solve certain things. So instead of calling culture a disease I, I think it would 
be, it could be called the uh, man, Im gonna have to cut this out and whatever. So everything is delusion? What is delusion? Delusion is that which 
does not correlate with reality, right? Right? Delusion is that which does not correlate with 
reality, is delusional to say that this is a water bottle, if Im holding up a mouse and I 
mean water bottle, this is not a water bottle, its delusional if I think this is and I try to drink 
from it, that is delusional. It is not connected up with how things actually are. Now if youre 
talking about things that actually are the case, then that is not delusional. I wouldnt say that everything is a delusion, Im, I, I dont know really 
that much about the epistemology but um, I would say that value exists in the sense that 
religious dogma exists. It, this belief in religion exists but all its assertions about reality are 
nothing other than delusions. And in the same way, value exists but its a distortion of reality. Um, perception is a coercive delusion, its, it exists but as a delusion, (laughter). I know 
Im just repeating myself but I think Im getting the point across. The problem is that I do feel immense 
meaning, and so does everyone else. Enjoy it, so it is, it is there, and? I think Ive addressed this, um, in my, earlier in this video but just in case I 
havent, my point is that meaning doesnt cure suffering, meaning is the source of suffering. Happiness is merely the fulfilment of value I disagree. Sometimes you wake up and youre just happy for no apparent reason, sometimes you just laugh for no apparent reason. ",1
"99","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","It doesnt have to be dependent on a lack of something and 
the gaining of something, its not all about a lack of stuff, its not all about being cultural, 
you attach entirely too much value to culture. Oh, isnt that an irony? I agree that happiness isnt like prayer, where first you pray and then your 
prayers are answered. Since happiness is just biological, its possible to just be happy, but in 
general the entire point of happiness is to serve as a reward for fulfilling value. First you have 
this desire, and then when you fulfill the desire, you achieve happiness. So, um well a lot 
of the time when youre randomly happy its because you dont perceive a certain deprivation 
to be important enough to affect your random happiness. I remember reading that one of 
the 9/11 hijackers was asked, eh, um, Why do you never laugh? And he responded, How 
can you laugh when people in Palestine are dying? And I think that someone like him wouldnt, because he hav has this problem, I dont think that someone like him would ever, 
or at least not very often, experience random happiness. I think he would be suffering a lot.
Or, but you prefer to not be alive, and you prefer to see, theres 
a bit of a contradiction there, you prefer to not prefer? So, you prefer to not prefer so youre 
trying to not prefer not preferring, or youre trying not prefer, preferred or not preferring. 
So, your preference of not preferring is getting in the way of preferring not living because 
that would be better than living even though living, thats a value statement about 
not having value statements because and then you overstate that, such that you hate your 
own values. But itself is a st is a value statement, cause hatred is a value thing and so you 
hating your own hatred, and so you hate yourself. Uh, thats the problem with all of this. A lot of people like Buddhists and 
Stoics, however they define enlightenment, they believe that enlightenment can be achieved 
in life. That you can overcome what they call suffering, but I, my value leads me to hate 
value because well, [laughter] what you said. Its incoherent and I think the problem about 
that is that I cant free myself from value and still be alive. So, the enlightenment, which I 
use very, very, very loosely, my enlightenment lies in death where I, I do not have any value. Culture has values which 
others mindlessly coerce each oth into, onto each other, hm thats true in a spiritual 
sense in that we cannot continue living in this 3d realm without the assumption of these 
value things, i.e., morality this, morality that, its basically in order to be alive in this 3d 
realm, you have to have some sort of moral value in going about you. Well not necessarily 
have to, but its very likely for it to be occurring, that is the cultural programming.",1
"100","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","Spreading it no differently than any other disease. 
Um, similar, Id say not no differently but quite similar. Why do you want to eliminate your 
cultural values? If you eliminate your cultural values, all your values, you cease to exist. Why? 
Because you cease to see any reason to living, therefore you die, by one reason or another. 
Or you continue living and hate yourself the entire time. That doesnt sound like fun, might 
as well just put a gun to your head and go boom.  Thats, heh, thats basically the idea . . . um, I dont want to live, I want to die. What do you mean by you lack the discipline to commit suicide? 
That doesnt make any sense to me, lack the discipline . . . so, so like when you think about 
committing suicide, what go  what do  what goes through your mind?  Im definitely not happy to be alive. I . . . um, I, I, would like to die, but the 
reason why . . . when I think about, when I get the thought into my head, Youre going to kill 
yourself in one minute, I . . . um, I . . . Im compelled to live in the same sense that someone 
who is addicted to cocaine is compelled to continue their indulgence. They  they definitely 
dont, well, heh, sometimes . . . they definitely dont want to be addicted to cocaine, but they 
cant control it because they dont have enough self discipline. And thats the problem 
that I have, a cocaine addict will say, Oh, this  this is the last time, Im definitely not going 
to do it again, once I take it this last time but if it were truly the last time then they wouldnt 
need to . . . indulge with . . . they wouldnt need to have that last indulgence. So, theyre not 
really overcoming their addiction, theyre just continuing to feed it just as much as they 
were previously and Im in the same position. I think, Oh, this period of time will be good 
and then Ill die, and . . . it ends up not being the last period because if it really were the last 
period, I would just kill myself instantly, instead of having to continue to live through that.
Theres, I, I can think of two ways that you can choose to overcome an addiction. The first 
is that you can have the self discipline to recognize that you need to overcome your addiction, and . . . you know that youll have an intense desire to persist in your addiction but if you um 
. . . continue to persist in overcoming it, youll, that desire will eventually disappear. And I . . . 
I dont have that discipline. Theres one other way you can choose to overcome an addiction 
and that is to allow your addiction to get you into some circumstances such that continuing the addiction would have more, would have much more intolerable consequences than 
ending the addiction would have. Such as a cocaine addict ending up living in a dumpster, 
blowing strangers for cocaine money, that kind of a thing. And they would feel forced into 
giving up their addiction, and I think thats the position that I need to be in to overcome 
this, because my life right now is . . . I hate using this word because its misleading, but my 
life right now is way too comfortable to . . . for me to feel forced into killing myself. But . . . 
thats probably going to be the way I die, Im going to . . . I, I, well either that or Ill develop 
the discipline to just say, None of this is helping me I just need to die and I know that I 
wont want to go through with it at the last second but I just need to do it and I guess thats 
the end of the response video, heh, Im sorry to end on such a macabre note. I know that I 
can kind of rain on the parade, but . . . well, hehe, you wanted a response video so here it 
is. Thanks for listening.",1

"104","AdamLanza","Antinatalism","Hello, . Thank you for the response to my My Antinatalism video. Um, I rearranged some of the things you said so that I could make my response 
clearer, so whoever else is watching this, you should first watch my My Antinatalism video, 
so that you can actually hear what Im saying. And I agree that, um, I speak too quietly, and I 
mumble too much, and my computers loud, Ill  Ill try to resolve all of that and once you 
watch that video, you should watch his response and then watch this response. Because 
just watching my  this video by itself isnt going to be an accurate representation of his video.
Thats not antinatalism, thats, uhh, anatalism, suppose that anatalism means positive of life? Fuck is anatalism Im going to look that up. Natalism is a belief 
that promotes human reproduction. Okay, so you would be an anatalist, not an antinatalist 
in that case. I agree that antinatalism is an inaccurate term to be using to describe 
my position. The reason why I use that is because its the kind  its the kind of terminology that other people on YouTube are using for similar positions, and um despite that, 
I actually do agree with antinatalism, I would like it if life stopped propagating. But I think 
my position can be more accurately stated as antivalueism, or something like that.
What, why the emphasis on, on the existential aspect it almost 
sounds like youre being too defensive? I was being too defensive at that part, um, when Im trying to figure something out, I open WordPad and then I type in a thought, and then press enter a few times, 
type in another thought, and another thought and it all gradually ends up becoming sort 
of a personal essay. And most of that video came from one of those essays I wrote a while 
ago, but that existentialism paragraph, I took verbatim from what I wrote, so. When Im 
writing these things, Im usually in an emotional state and I wrote that after looking online 
for reasons why you shouldnt kill yourself, and I wasnt trying to find a compelling argument, I was just bored and I found so many people responding to suicidal forum posters, 
saying, I know exactly where youve been, I too have felt that my life was out, was without 
meaning, and heh, it was ironic because I have the opposite problem. So, I was just 
getting kind of irritated with seeing that relentlessly and not seeing a single person expressing what I was feeling. Youve always had immense hatred for culture. Why? I wish I could express why I hate culture in one sentence, but thats, 
um, thats not going to happen, Im going to have to ramble about this topic so forgive me 
for that. But I basically perceive culture the way that a normal person would perceive rape, 
and all of these abstractions are the incurable stds in my mind. Ive um Ive always 
reacted with terror to culture. Whenev Ive always had a problem with authority figures, and 
I would call authority, um, a source which tries to impose values onto you. And so, whenever 
I would interact with someone in an authoritative position, I would, I would always be eager 
to punish myself and hit myself and say how much I deserved to be tortured and that kind 
of thing. And I think the reason why I used to do that, even though I didnt understand it at 
the time, I think it was because I wanted to try to mitigate um their, quote discipline 
of me, even if it was a situation which they wouldnt even be doing that, its just interacting 
with an authority figure would upset me greatly.",1
"105","AdamLanza","Dream","I just woke up about ten minutes ago and I had a strange dream so I thought I would explain 
it. The background was basically, long story short was, I was in high school and I wasnt doing 
what I was supposed to do and told the authority figures to fuck off and I got imprisoned. So, 
ha, after that I was at my prison cell and two of the other prisoners got on guard duty, I dont 
know. Let me out, one of them was apparently an ex-gang leader . . . not sure why. And they 
led me to a desk where there was this poorly constructed wooden tricycle with low-quality 
rubber wheels or something like that.
We went up to the receptionists desk, I dont know . . . who he was, but he told me good luck 
and I got on the tricycle and started  they brought me over to a door and the receptionist 
told me to get in touch with my young side, or something like that. So, I started breathing 
heavily, thinking okay Ive got to prepare for somethingas we approached the door. And 
bravely ensued [?] into the room and it was the interior of a gym-gymnasium and there was 
this group of  of . . . spectators sitting on the floor in a circle, around some type of obstacle 
course that was about maybe twenty-five feet wide. And . . . it wasnt meant to be completed 
vertically, it was a horizontal course that you were supposed to circle around, and theres 
this star pattern in the center, but a little off to one of the sides . . . and you had to maneuver 
around this course using the tricycle. And make it as entertaining for the crowd as possible.
So, you were supposed to go around five times, for my first round, and there were five other 
prisoners who were competing and presumably whoever the crowd found most entertaining 
would get to be freed from the prison. So, for my first round I was . . . instead of riding the 
tricycle I was, you know how when you . . . have a bicycle you can kind of use the wheels to 
bounce? So thats what I was doing, I was bouncing twenty feet into the air. And the crowd 
liked that and I threw in some tricks in the second round where I was . . . um, spinning 360 
degrees and that kind of thing, and on the third round I started going backward and the 
crowd really liked that but after a few bounces I accidentally went out of bounds. They were cheering as I was leaving, and of course there was one guy who was saying, You 
fucking suckbut I sat out with the crowd and started watching the next two 
prisoners to see what they were going to do, that was supposed to be entertaining. Oh yeah 
and the outlines of this obstacle course um, had balloons laid around them, different colors. 
And once I got out of the course, my tricycle turned into this . . . balloon that was starting to 
lose its helium. Well, they  it didnt have any helium, it probably had a heavier-than-air gas 
in it, all of the balloons did and my balloon, um, was starting to lose its air. But I was watch-
ing the two other prisoners and all that they were  did to be entertaining was play some of 
the, what do they call it? Benny Hill theme music, and starts . . . tossing a balloon between 
the two of them. And I was thinking, this  thats, theyre not even doing anything, Im go-
ing to win this competition and then that was basically the point at which I woke up. And 
I thought, what was that? So anytime that Im  end up waking up and asking myself, What 
did I just dream?",1
"106","AdamLanza","Suffering","Im sure that any psychiatrists (secular priests) and TheRapists who would 
seek to dismiss my position as being the consequence of schizophrenia would orgasm if they read this:
 Life is the imposition of value. 
Cultural values are the masochistic imposition of suffering through the deprivation of their 
fulfillment. 
Feral values are the innate imposition of suffering through the deprivation of their fulfillment. 
Suffering tends to serve as a life-affirming experience. 
The less you suffer, the clearer you see that value is a disease. 
Death eradicates value and thus is the solution to life.
Relatively speaking and within the context of being alive, I have always been in a very 
privileged position. At this point in my life, I can pursue and achieve practically anything I 
would desire. And if I were to commit suicide, Im certain that  certain that many people 
would say, I cannot believe that lazy spoiled loser killed himself. Ive always been poor, my 
parents beat me, I was bullied every day as a child and I got raped, but despite all of that I 
still choose to live. 
This may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but my position is that someone does not 
choose to live despite suffering, its just to live because suffering is life affirming. The way 
that culture operates might help to demonstrate this, the first thing that anyone says when 
someone is suicidal, other than possibly saying, You need medication to change your 
mentally ill thoughts is You need to have goals in your life,but what are goals? A feral 
child does not have any goals, a feral child would not have any desire to become a renowned 
writer or an eminent scientist, or have interest in hobbies, or become an interesting person, 
or develop any  any of those character-building traits.
However, if that child were encultured, he would develop innumerable goals to achieve 
various things. Culture did not allow the feral child to discover the pleasure which he can 
achieve from experiencing any of those things, culture imposed the deprivation of not achiev-
ing those things, and thus created out of nothing, the pleasure which results from fulfilling 
that deprivation. Culture is masochism. Since life seeks to propagate itself, I suspect that 
culture emerged to prevent human intellect from enabling feral people to lose their aversion 
to death. Ted Kaczynskis experience is an example of this happening. When he had spent enough time alone in his cabin, he said that he became okay with dying at any moment 
because he was happy with his life.
My interpretation of this is that he had sufficiently overcome his enculturation to the point 
where he was no longer being hurt by it. Since he wasnt hampered with the deprivation 
which culture imposes, he was not afraid of dying. In the past, the cultural reason why you 
couldnt kill yourself was because God said so. Or because it will continue some metaphysi-
cal cycle of suffering, or because your parents own your body and suicide is dishonorable. 
These days, the dominant cultural justification for life is this belief that you cant kill yourself 
because there are things that need to be accomplished in life. But you do not live for the 
achievement of your goals, you have goals so that you will continue to live and thus will 
continue to propagate life.
I used to distinguish between the fulfillment of cultural and feral values, but then I realized 
that feral values are just as coercive of a delusion as cultural values are. I still emphasize 
cultural so much because of how prominent it is, and once you understand that culture is a 
disease, you can recognize that life itself is a disease. The deprivation which results from the 
existence of both cultural and feral values are the only reason why anyone wants to live. Life 
is suffering, everyone has heard that statement, but they dont accept it at face value. They 
interpret it to mean that life has suffering, but life is suffering, and suicide is the solution.",1

To keep his voice from cracking and his mouth from being overly dry while interviewing he had drunk lots of water. During the course of the day he was so nervous, and had timed the interviews so closely that he did not have enough time to break for the bathroom. At the end of the second interview he was desperate to go to the bathroom. There was a bathroom in the second office, but all of the stalls were in use. He couldn't wait for use of the stalls - he needed to go so bad - so the next best thing was the sink.    Without delay he whipped it out and began to relieve himself...well he was so pent up with the stress and pressure of needed to urinate for the past couple of hours that the release   made him pass out.   he was found a few moments later on the floor of the mens bathroom, passed out, pants down hand on himself and lying in a puddle.   - needless to say he didn't get that job.  It doesn't do it justice to retell it in type...it is much better told in person...Honestly I nearly lost it on Sunday past while at a resturant drinking a Freakin Huge soda, just imagining my roadies passed out on the floor from the sheer pleasure of relieving themselves.   *teehee*    ",0

"121","979795","Technology","                 OK something really disgusting occurred on Thursday. That morning I happily donned my shoe and went to work as usual. Spent a whole day in school and went Aikido at Siglap after work. Arrived early as usual and started to change. Lo and behold, guess what I found? There was a freaking dead cockroach smeared on the right side inside of my right shoe. Ewwww ... freaking gross. Cleared out whatever of its remains I could and blocked out the thought as I went on with Aikido for the night. Can't quite shake the thought out when I had to change back and go home after class. Moment I got home, removed my shoes and went to wash my gi + socks (blood  smear on my socks). Thoroughly washed out the inner regions of my shoes with a  fibrous brush and an old tooth brush. All the while the remains were like being removed really slowly. I figured I must have worn out a whole chunk of my shoe with all the hard scrubbing I did. Lesson learnt? I always shake my shoes to throw out whatever dirt, insect or creepy crawly first before sticking my foot in now.  Yesterday went to River Valley High to take a company test. Technically I was late but when I arrived it seems like people had just settled in a few mins ago only. Test turned out to be OK. Was decently easy, but it's not like I'll be getting a high score in it or anything lah. Just felt that they were reasonable questions though some terms were a bit technical. I was lucky that during my first 3 days in the company, I had an expert like Angelica walkthrough me a lot of the stuff. After the test, I went to Clementi central to make a new pair of specs. Cost me like $240. Freaking expensive but I figured getting one I really liked will last me longer plus I guess I really needed the new specs. The new one came with 2 clip-on sunglasses. Always wanted to get one to replace my old set years ago. My old ones are either too dented or scratched from Aikido or dropping them now and again. One small news, turns out my old specs degree were a bit high. It was like right eye 500, left eye 700 (astigmatism). But after the tests, it was 500 and 650. Could've reduced it to 625 but the optician said 50 degree reduction is a lot already and she recommends doing 650 instead because the eye needs some adjustment. After this, I met up with Tang for lunch at Mac's and we proceeded back to River Valley High area for Aikido training.  It was my first official lesson with Yuishinkai. Their ki emphasis is definitely a lot more structured then Aikikai. Maybe structured isn't exactly the right word. The thing is they use the words ki, ki direction a lot more than us. Just doing warmups alone, Frankie Sensei went through how our hips, center, arms, ki direction should be going. Very very very detailed. I can understand some but not all. At the end of class, he passed me some forms to fill up and a copy of their syllabus as well as one set of illustration for their warmups. Willl try to scan these in when I get the time, but anyone with Koichi Tohei's movie clip called Authentic Aikido will be able to see everything better. In terms of technique, everything was about redirecting ki, placing yourself, footwork, etc. That doesn't sound so different from what Aikikai style does, but practically to apply what I've learnt from the warmups was a whole different thing. The thing is, there are so many similarities between Yuishinkai style and Ah Hee Sensei's. I guess that's why Freddy Sensei said, all Aikido is the same. Just a lot of different 'brands' out there.  Stupid cough is getting from bad to worse. Think it's the cold drinks I've been taking since Thurs till now. Sigh, have to watch my food and water consumption again. Mon will be the start of term 2 and I need to take the class lessons for the upper primary levels. First week is like my killer week but subsequently the afternoons do get better. But still, I've got a lot of outstanding tasks not done or just started only. Need smokebomb liao, hahaha.               ",0

"145","947299","Law","    urlLink  Sep   talks about an interesting article in his post--- which i wish i had a link to, i'd love to read it.  So, without a) sumerizing what Sep already said or b) having read the article Sep discusses,   i'm going to give my opinions on it.  Seems to me that I'm what Sep calls an 'extreme internalist'-- that is i believe that once we answer 'what is moral,' we have answered 'why be moral.'-- as i would define 'morality,' as something like 'what we ought to do,' or 'what the good actions are.'  but then Susan Wolf's article poses a bit of a problem for me, where she says, as Sep paraphrases, 'if you spend every waking hour working for OxFam, you're behaving less-than-admirably; you ought to take up the clarinet or read some Chekhov at least some of the time.'  Seems to me that all Susan Wolf has said is that morality doesn't require me to work for oxfam all the time, but that the Good entails some idea of self-betterment.  How could this be?  afterall, isn't self-betterment at the expense of others selfish?  well, depends.  First of all, i would say that I do have some form of right to my own stuff--the stuff that i worked hard for, myself, and earned through my labor-- and that giving up everything to help others isn't morally required.  but more than that, I don't think that Truth (capital T-- the ideal of truth) is just an instrumental good.  Philosophizing and thinking about the world and metaphysics, and other 'lofty' things are good, in and of themselves, not just because they lead to my own personal betterment.  So, i would agree with Susan wolf that we shouldn't always strive for complete and total altruism, but i would disagree that morality=altruism.  ",0

What I remember best from the homily is the idea that sometimes we try to 'cast out Satan with Satan.' We give in to certain sins to avoid others. Perhaps this is most obvious in the realm of sexual temptation. For example, a married man is tempted to infidelity, so instead he checks out pornographic websites, or a college student is tempted to fornication, but instead commits solitary acts of impurity. In avoiding the greater sin, we let ourselves indulge in the lesser. However, this binds us to the Enemy, and divides the 'kingdom' of our soul.

I used to be a graphic designer. I  lived  in Quark XPress. Thousands of hours, thousands of pages. I still remember the keyboard shortcut for 'decrease tracking by 1/200th of an em,' though I would rather not. It's not my bread and butter anymore, but I've been following the app's creep toward OS X, and like most have been boggled by the slow pace. In many cases this is the only thing binding design pros to OS 9. They want to migrate to OS X, but they can't.  As of this moment the page says almost nothing about the new version, only noting 'enhanced undo functionality, full-resolution previews, and an intriguing way to manage complex projects.' Strikingly uninformative -- and the screen shot promises little new other than Aqua trim on XPress's well-worn, spartan interface. Of course, we shouldn't judge print apps by web time. The task of publishing a magazine is substantially the same now as it was ten years ago, and most large publishing workgroups are slow to upgrade because of myriad software dependencies (I wonder how far they're gotten with updating  urlLink QPS ?).  The important thing is that they  get this thing out the frickin' door .   Though Quark is widely criticized in the industry for an unresponsive attitude toward customers, I really would like them to survive, because I believe that an Adobe monopoly -- which is what we are heading for -- would ultimately be bad for the industry.  urlLink Discuss          ",0

Be prepared to say 'Do you want that biggie sized?' because that's about the only job you will be able to get.  Like Martin Sullivan, you're not that big of deal. You're not that important. You're not going to stop the world or business. Get a life. Someone will be happy to jump in and take over.  If you don't like what your boss is doing or you didn't get what you wanted, so what?

"176","898887","indUnk","              Cookie Monster   So in light of events that have taken place about 30 minutes ago I am feeling quite uninspired.  I decided that I would make sugar cookies but that they needed a twist...a new taste...a dash of diva.  So I found a quick and simple sugar cookie receipe.  I baked the first batch as just plain sugar cookies.  They tasted wonderful...like the old fashioned sugar cookies my grandmother makes.  Where they are a little sugary but still have a sort of shortbread taste.  Wonderful I thought.  Now to add my twist and make them 'my signature cookie.'  So I took butterscotch chips and almonds to them.  There were 5 chips and an almond in the center.  Introducing Butterscotch Almond a la Sugar Cookies.  My father was the taste tester for these cookies.  And as luck would have it he couldn't get enough of them until I told him he had to stop eating them because they were for the people at work.  So I made the cookies.  All 6 dozen.  I thought to myself I really want to have the cut-out sugar cookies (i.e. Santa, bells, snowmen..you get it) so I made another batch of the dough.  It turned out fabolous for making the shaped cookies.  They were baked.  Turned out great.  So after all the cookies are cooled and I am sure that my new invention cookies will be a hit tomorrow I get a shower and relax for a while.  So then I say to Mom and Dad that we have to try one of the cookies again to make sure that they are suitable for tomorrow.  We all taste the cookies after they have 'cooled,' remember we had only tasted them warm out of the oven before.  Well let me tell you something they were so soft and fluffy.  Perfect texture and color.  Brown tipped edges.  However, and this is the outcome of 2 hours of baking...sugar cookies that taste wonderful when them are warm...but when they cool they taste like complete shit.  They tasted like flour.  I put in 2 1/2 cups of sugar.  It only called for 1 cup.  Where did the sweet, sugary taste that they had when they were warm go?  Why do my sugar cookies always turn to shit?  Why?  So needless to say the second batch of cookies were tossed in the trash.  The first batch I made are good but they don't taste like they did when the were warm.  Here is the best description I can give of what they orginally tasted like:  Nutty due to the almond Extremely sugary due to the overuse of sugar Buttery A slight hint of butterscotch  Now they taste of all purpose flour.  So needless to say I will be baking a different kind of cookie that I had orginally wanted to bake.  They are called 'Paper Thin Brown Edged Sugar Cookies.'  This is the receipe that my mother made years ago.  She couldn't find the receipe for me so I decided to use the online receipe like she suggested...it is a dud.  So she somehow remembers the receipe after the fact of me baking 12 dozen cookies.  These sugar cookies always turn out fabolous.  These are the only sugar cookies that I can bake that turn out good.  Why do I always try to use a new receipe that will never turn out?  Huh?  I should know better by now.  Mom is helping me with these cookies because my back is hurting really bad from standing on the ceramic tile floor for 2 hours.  Thank God she found her receipe.  I am forever indebted.    I told her that if she didn't want to help bake them that she could go to the store and get the pre packaged ones but then I thought 'That is cheating.  Christmas cookies are supposed to be baked from the heart because that is one of the few things that still remains a Christmas tradition I will not cheat.'  So onto another 2 hours of baking.  Please wish me luck.  And Jess, if you should ever visit my site again thanks for your comment about FAO Schwartz.  I love that store and would hate to see it go out of business.  Have you ever been there?  And also if you have been there isn't the hall of magnents faboo?  Thanks for visiting the site dear...I only have a few select people who read so it's nice to see others stopping by.  Have a great holiday!!  Smooches people!  I out for the rest of the day.  I've written too much and baked too much.  What I really need to do is smoke too much and passout.  Oh but if I still did drugs...I found the bowl Manda R. made me when I worked at AB & C...it is so cute.  She told me I had to use it before I died and I will if I ever decided to get smoked up again.  How I would love to have some of the hash crispy treats she made that one time at work.  Memories.         ",0

"184","883178","Fashion","           Thanks Hal.  I feel much better.  So I've been thinking about what I should 'give up' during the Lenten season.  This is a lot of pressure - I mean, I already have to stop eating meat on Fridays, and then there's the whole Easter Vigil thing on Holy Saturday which is just about the longest mass in existence.  When I still sang in the Cathedral choir, this was the Big One...the one we all dreaded because it meant we had to stand for 3 hours straight.  And we didn't get to stand in the choir loft in back, but smack dab in the front, in front of the entire congregation, sweating to death and feeling like we're all gonna faint.  So, yes, Lent is a lot about sacrifice (considering everything JC did on the cross and all), but why does it have to be?  Instead of 'giving something up', I'm going to try and be a better person...at least for 40 days.  How am I going to do that?  Well, I'll start by buying all my friends in Minneapolis a round when I'm in town next week.  And then I'll try not to yell at old ladies in the bus anymore.  And then for the finale, I will make sure to (try) and keep my mouth shut when I see someone dressed like a slut.  It's the least I can do.  In other news, if anyone has been keeping score: Mike Walsh of  urlLink 'Bowling Roadtrip'  fame, has finished bowling in all 50 states.

I hope that at least some of them make clear his violence, his straighforward goals of communism, fraternity, and insurgency. Che isn't a rebel, he was a man who believed in a political cause enough to kill for it. Those are two very different things.   I think that Che was brilliant, his handbook on guerrila action is still applicable and utilized. Nearly as cogent as Mao's. But his brilliance, effectiveness, and idealism hardly polish away his leadership of military police in cuba, his rage and hatred of US imperialism. It will be interesting to see how they blunt these things. It's one thing to print him on a tshirt, or dress up like him on an album cover, it's quite another to get someone to play him onscreen. Although I do think Benecio del Toro is an inspired choice, given the right script.  turn up some Rage today, and ponder your own thoughts on this professional revolutionary that is being turned into an advertising tool.

"195","861706","indUnk","             Ok, I just finished making a database of all my video games, and a database of my movies.  Here's the stats:  I have 94 video games: 2 GameCube games, 5 XBox games, 8 Playstation 2 games, 14 Playstation games, 13 Nintendo 64 games, 17 Super Nintendo games, and 35 Nintendo (NES) games. That's not counting my GameBoy and GameBoy Color games, though, because I don't even know where they are exactly, they've been packed up somewhere for about a year.  I've got about 10 of them, I think.  I also discovered I am missing some games.  I can't find my Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo, or Super Mario Brothers/Duckhunt cartridge for the NES.  There's about 20 more video games around the house, but they're actually my sisters, even though now that I'm moving out, she has no systems to play most of them on.  She's got a GameCube, and a Playstation 2, but she also owns games for the Playstation, (which she can play on the PS2, since it's backwards compatible) and for the N64.  Ok, now for the movies. I have 123 movies, 47 are DVDs, 76 are VHS, but... but, some of them are the same title repeated, some movies I own on VHS, but then I went out and bought the DVD version later.  Such as Monty Python and the Holy Grail, and Monty Python's Life of Brian, I own them on both formats.  Also, the 47 DVDs refers to 47 titles, there are actually more DVDs than that, because, for example, one of the titles, The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus, is a collection that is actually made up of 14 DVDs.  Here's some more movie stats that will show you many things about me, for example, how geeky I am.   8 of these titles are non-fiction: A&E Biographies and documentaries and such, 5 are about the Kennedy Assassination, this includes the Oliver Stone's movie, JFK, 2 are about Area 51, and were actually bought from The Little A'le'Inn, in Rachel, Nevada, 10 are Anime, 5 are 'Kung Fu' movies, such as Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, 6, if you count The Matrix, 9 are Monty Python, this includes the film Jabberwocky, which technically wasn't a Monty Python film, but is often considered such, 3 more are some other form of British Comedy, such as Benny Hill, 1 of those 3 is the complete collection of every episode of 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,' 5 of them are the 5 Star Wars movies, 16 are Star Trek, 3 movies and 13 episodes on tape.  The only thing geekier than the movies and quantity of games I own is the fact that I made a database of all of them, and then spent another hour figuring up all these statistics about them.  And then, to make it even geekier, I got on the  internet , and wrote about it on my  blog .  Perhaps the geekiest thing of all, though, is that fact that I am proud of how geeky I am, and did all this just so I could brag about it.  In fact, I like to think of this entire thing as the product of rolling a natural 20 on a d20 roll for geekiness.  And that last sentence just made me  even more geeky .  Life is good.         ",0

"200","854956","Student","                 Hey everyone.  Well, I had a good weekend, and I'm sure that next weekend will prove to be just as fun and eventful.  :-)  This weekend Ricky and Melissa came into town to finish stuff up with their Halloween costumes.  We all went to see Jackass:  The Movie on Friday night.  By 'we' I mean Ricky, Mike, Melissa, and I.  We had a good time, aside from the experience I had at Jim's sitting next to Mike, who was acting like a complete ass.  But, after the movie and Jim's we went to Ricky's.  The three of them played a video game, I just sat and watched, and dozed off a few times... ;-)  Then, after Ricky had stopped playing the game, he and I were talking about various things and laughing a lot.  I was feeling silly by that point, because I was really really sleepy.  And I sorta act drunk or something when I am really tired.  It was good fun, though...!  Then Saturday morning Jamey called and told me to get down to the church to help out with the Fall Festival.  Well, it was good to see Jamey, and Pam's daughter Stacey... it was NOT good to get spit up on by a (very cute, but sick) baby.  :-(  Thankfully, I'm sorta NOT easily nauseatable (if that's a word) when it comes to kid poop or spit up/vomit.  That's a gained characteristic I got from working in childcare.  Anyhow, so, I got a spaghetti plate to-go, went home and ate it for lunch, and did some stuff around the house till I had to go to Roosevelt to pick up Mexican Dinner plates because my Mom bought tickets, and she and my Dad had to go to Shiner, TX.  Anyhow, the dinner was interesting.  I got to see a lot of people that I miss, and a lot of people that I don't miss at all.  I came home, waited for my parents return, missed out on seeing a kickass movie, but gained the chance to go spend time with Melissa and her family!  It was fun, I didn't realize how much I missed the Morris'.  And it sorta made me sad that the only time I get to see them is when Mel comes to town.  HAHA  I don't know how much they'd appreciate me just stopping by.  ;-)  Anyhow, we watched the movie 'Dead Presidents.'  Very interesting movie, if you don't mind war movies.  Cause for a long while there, that's what it was.  But it was funny to hear Mr. Morris's comments... hehe  Anyway, then I ended up staying there till like, 2-something in the morning, cause me and Melissa were 'girl talking'... actually, a lot of it was more laugh than talk.  But, at any rate it was lots of fun.  Hopefully this coming weekend will be just as great.  See, I tried talking Melissa into coming in town again next weekend so we could go see 'The Ring'  (the movie we missed out on seeing because we were busy and couldn't make the movie on time).  So, she suggested me coming to A-Town to see the movie there with her, and that way I'd also get to see Wolf.  It was an excellent idea on her part, I must say!  :-)  So, next weekend I shall be in A-Town, doing various shtuff.  And I'll probably just stay till Sunday night this time, because my parents will be out of town and not at church this weekend, too.  So, I won't be attending church.  They'll actually be in North Austin, I believe.  But I'm not sure, so don't hold me to that comment.  Anyhow, on that note I shall close my blog entry for the day.

Don't get me wrong, this isn't a diss on St. Tom's or Heidi or The Holy Spirit but rather a confession.  I couldn't deal with having to smile and laugh along with people who were affected in a way I've never understood cog I've rarely experienced.  I wasn't prepared to run the risk of feeling inadequate because I'm still standing still and rehearsing excuses in my head; its happened to many times before.

Yet I found it really facinating that it came from a bottle of alcohol!! But isn't that true though?  That if you're going to be original, you'd just be copied by someone?  How many of us nowadays say or do something that we can really call OUR OWN THING? Not too many huh? How many of us put on clothing every day that is not inspired by someone or something? Do people who says they have their own style really do have their own style? Or are they just doing that so that they could say that their unique?  Is that true? Do they really have their own style? Or is it once again taken from an idea of someone outside of their knowledge? I'm not trying to say anything bad or judging people, so don't get all argumentative with me lol! It was just a thought! I do it myself, I can honestly say that I have no originality! If I analyze my whole life, I don't think I can recount a time when I didn't want to have something of another person or even be what someone is! If you tell me you've never.. you'll just be LYING to me and yourself!! Because we both know that that's bullshit! BTW, What does it even mean to be 'ORIGINAL' or 'UNIQUE' nowadays!????? Does it still have the same meaning from the dictionary when used to describe someone? Makes you wonder huh? Whoever said alcohol makes you stupid!!? LoL! It was just funny that something I read from an alcohol bottle would inspire such truth!   NOTE: ** Product name was changed due to legal reasons! LoL!                ",0

"220","814486","Internet","             That Pink concert last night was wicked! I've never been to a live rock/pop concert before (as sad as that is, it's true...), so it was a real experience for me. There was a warm-up band (1ere partie, in French) who weren't that bad, but they still seemed crap compared to Pink. It's amazing how someone so small (she really is tiny) can have so much stage presence, and get the crowd going. She even spoke some French during the concert, like: 'Bonsoir, je m'appelle Pink, enchantÃ©!' which was quite sweet - the crowd loved her. The concert was in Juan-Les-Pins, a sea-side town full of bars, restaurants and night-clubs, a great place for going out, if you're lucky enough to find a parking space! We actually got a ride down with Billou, James and Jeannine (James' girlfriend), in their new-ish open-top Audi A4 - music blaring, and hair blowing in the wind, it was great, if a little cramped with the five of us... The trip back at abou 23h wasn't so great, as soon as you start getting away from the sea, it starts to get chilly, and going at 100 km/h with the roof down, you really feel the cold. But still, one wicked evening. I wish we'd gone to that David Guetta live performance down in La Siesta night-club last weekend... I'm sure he'll back back next year.    Jogged/ran into work again this morning. You know, you get so used to having good weather here that you don't even think that it might rain. For example, last night when we got back from the concert, I shaved so as not to look like a scruff at work and to avoid having to shave before the run in the morning - not at one moment did I think that it might be raining in the morning... And you don't normally, so that when you wake up, and it is actually raining, you're all confused and have to change your plans... That's one of the great things about this place!    Just got back now from lunch. Went down to Cap 3000, the nearest big shopping centre, and had lunch at the sushi bar there. The French aren't, as a general rule, much into sushi. Surprising really, when you see how many French people order 'steak tartare' for lunch... (that's basically really fresh, raw beef, served with raw onion slices, herbs, salad and chips). I love sushi though. I'm lucky enough not to have had a bad experience with it yet, unlike some people I know. It's one of those 'aquired tastes' you generally tend to either pick up later in life, or just hate for ever, like olives for some people. Raw fish by itself really isn't that exciting, or especially tasty, but when you combine its subtle flavour with sushi rice and soy with a little wasabi sauce,  you've got a taste explosion, that lingers deliciously in your mouth until you clear your platate with a thin slice of pickled ginger, ready for the next delight... Hmm. My mouth's watering just at the thought of it!    If you've not had sushi before, but are willing to try even though you may be a little apprehensive of the experience, I suggest you go to a proper sushi bar, with a real (preferably old, and therefore experienced) sushi chef who prepares the sushi for you in front of your eyes. Start with some of the less imposing tastes, such as a cucumber 'maki' (small roll of rice wrapped in dried seaweed, and with a cube of cucumer in the middle), and dip it into a little soy. If you like the taste combination, chances are you'll like the fish sushis too, so go for something like a tuna 'maki', like the cucumber one, but with a small cube of tuna inside, instead. Most people tend to find that the first time they try fish sushi (i.e. the thin slice of fish on a mouch-sized portion of rice), that it's a bit too much, to fast. So, if you are in a sushi bar with a real sushi chef, ask him to prepare smaller sized salmon or 'fatty tuna' (the best bit of the tuna) sushi for you, as it is much more easy to handle, for your first time... If you like spicy things, then you might enjoy dissolving a little of the green wasabi paste into your soy bowl before you dip your sushi into it.    OK, enough about sushi now, I need to work... ;-)  Going to see 'I, robot' tomorrow night in Cannes - really looking forward to it.           ",0

I apparantly gave some kickass advice to a friend, as you all know I am exceedingly good at, and had major cuddletime with my boy that was def appreciated.

"235","798653","indUnk","       I don't think the site has failed necessarily, but it's on its way. Half of the links on most of the pages are broken links,(the ask Pat page is nearly impossible to get to) you can't get to anyone's profiles without some digging, some of the blogs have never had any participation, some pages have disappeared all together, the front page is a great start, the magazine section is good, the rest seems cluttered, and forgotten. Some pages have all the names on the left, some have it on the right, some pages have the blog links, others don't. Some have broken link buttons, others have the buttons but don't link.   I think the first step should remove this clutter, so we can see what we are working with. The next step would be to send an email to everyone asking for a response to be either on this site or not(I know this was done once already, but there were still thirty or so names on the left (and sometimes right) from people that haven't contributed. Nothing against them, but why waste the space?. ) Let's tighten formation, close ranks, find some identity, instead of being all over the place. When I direct people to itwillfail that is what nearly everyone tells me. It's cluttered and all over the place. Is is an online zine, is it some sort home for journalism majors, what is it will fail? Even though it appears to be a collected group of creative and semi creative people, it's hard to convey that.   So, some solutions:  Get rid of all the blogs, except for the super blog. Conceptually all the others are great, the idea of various discussions on music, movies, Topical topics, and so forth, is great, but they don't really have much participation, so drop 'em.(yes, even my own Collective cable blog. I stopped working on the cable job, and subsequently stopped writing about it.) We have the comment system links that people could comment on particular topics all within the same Blog.   All the personal blogs seem to be flourishing rather well. Most of the ones I've checked are fairly up to date, keep those, in fact let's incorporate that into the site more, seeing as though it is the most frequently updated aspect. But maybe have a FEATURED personal blog on the main page, for a day, or a week or something. Just something to put it on the front page, maybe even a teaser line or two from it.   For the Murphinator, and Co. more chat invites, scheduled ones. Have it is advertised on the front page (come chat with us at X pm on X date) and then continue having the archived chats ah la the magazine within the site. It doesn't need to be jazzed up too much.   Have routine submission requests, not blanketed ones to everyone all the time, but occasionally single someone out and say 'hey could you write/do something, or could you update your blog (if they are the featured one)' etc. I know that sounds like more work for Murph, but hey...   The beauty of this site isn't the content, is the collective. I could point out a plethora of sites that contain much richer content, more wit, better writing, etc. etc. But we aren't trying to compete with any other site, are we? We should focus on the plausible community aspect, that's what is so damn appealing about itwillfail. The idea and the notion that there are twenty or so people reading your stuff, and you reading theirs, that is what was/is great about the site. Whatever steps are taken to keep the site active should consider that notion. I mean shit, we have people DOING things, we have people getting married, going to far away places, going to far away schools, meeting new people, people in bands, photographers, artist, animators, film buffs, music lovers, pre law students, and so and so on.(at least I think we do) Yeah all that potential content is great, but I'm much more interested in the potential characters, the people going places, creating, learning, etc. etc.   Okay, those are just some thoughts.

"240","794223","Student","    urlLink    Cheerful  I just got back from Aaron's place.  Heth tho sweet--he burned me a bunch of cd's .  I'm jealous of his XBox.  The last time I was over there, I played the Lord of the Rings game for so long that my carpel tunnel syndrome re-developed.  I got my diploma through the mail this weekend .  I felt certain that UT would screw up once again, and do something monumentally stupid like mail it to the wrong address.  I almost didn't get my diploma because, once again, somebody wasn't doing their job.  Oh well--it's over now.  It feels so odd to really and truly be done; I feel as if I should be working on something, but I'm officially done!  I've graduated, taken the GRE, and applied to my graduate schools.  (UT and Tulane)  It feels awkward being around campus with everyone else still in school.  Not that I'm complaining; it just feels odd.  My grandparents and I spent several days with Brandi, and it was wonderful to see her again--this time in much better spirits; the last time we saw her, she was in ICU shortly after surgery.  All of us feel very confident in this upcoming surgery, because she's having the most qualified neurosurgeon in the country operate on her.  Plus, it's not like we really have any other option at this point; she can't start radiation, because radiation is supposed to cause expansion in the brain.  She has no room for expansion, due to the fact that the tumor in her head is 5 inches long and 2 inches thick.  Brandi has an unbelievable support group; hundreds of people have been in and out of her house in the past month; the people of this small town in the middle of nowhere outside of Houston have offered to help her with bills, drive her around, pay her mother's insurence, and cook and clean for her.  Brandi has received get-well cards from around the world, many from people that she doesn't even know.  A few days ago the father of one of their friends died, and he requested that in lieu of flowers, all gifts be made to the Brandi Ward Fund.  On the 11th of February, East Bernard is going to have a raffel dinner for her, and the've already sold over 600 tickets.  It's times like these when the pure selflessness of human nature does appear; this weekend we all caught my very cynical grandmother uttering the words, 'You know...people are basically good at heart.'  This coming from someone who gave up on the human race long ago.  It's as if God took a very tragic situation and molded it to His purpose; He knows that this family has suffered so much, and is now providing Brandi with everything that she possibly needs to get through this ordeal.  And she will--Brandi has vowed that she will not go down without a fight.  Besides...she's too fiesty and hard-headed .  This entire thing reminds me of one of my favorite quotes from the Scriptures:  'And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.' ~Romans 8:28  Amen.  On that note...I better head on to bed.  I seriously need to get my sleep schedule back on track.  I keep saying that I'm going to, but I always end up sleeping during the day and staying up all night.  We need schedules for night people! ",0

People paid just as little attention to me afterwards as they did before. Except my friends. Who are all like, 'Yea?'. Meh.  I spend far too much of my time wishing so-and-so was gay. Hell, I think I can tell better than they can. I can think of at least 10 people who I should just spreads rumors about to get it started. Then when they're out I can sleep with them, and never speak to them again.  I mean, I have to listen to people I hang out with complain that it's been too long since they've had sex. At least there are people of your sexual orientation that exist around you! Let's see how long it's been since Eric got laid. Umm....forever and a half! Buuyaka!  Don't get me wrong. I'm not all about sex with no love. I just don't associate them very well. But when Eric finally gets the love he desires(*wink wink* maybe?) I could totally dig that monogamy thing.

"244","788927","Communications-Media","       So Saturday night, Ellen and I went to the Emery, Watashi Wa, Mewithoutyou, Anberlin concert.  That rocked hard, I swear.  Emery sounded so clear, I loved it, I kinda only 'somewhat' liked them before the concert, and now I absolutely think they rock so hard.  Something about 6 Guys being on stage at once, flailing around, with a full array of instruments, that was awesome.  Watashi Wa, well let's put it this way, they rock so much harder in concert than on the CD's.  The CD's make them seem so.....poppy'ish, in concert it was like whoa, ROCK!!!.  They did some police song, 'Message in a Bottle' or something.  Still confused as to when my band, Mewithoutyou, that I went to see would come out.  Halfway into the Watashi Wa thingy, I read a wall thing, that said they were next, and my heart jumped.  Mewithoutyou, was probably my fave band there, they are like the beatles, if they dropped after grunge was the scene :).  Got a nice sound to them.  So they come up, and at the beginning, Aaron is there lying down on the ground, like stretching or sleeping or something, then like he lays there until his part of the song came up, that guy tweaks on stage so much, he RAWKS!!!.  So Bullet to Binary was up first, and the masses moved that mosh pit became so insane, it was funny he was like 'so yeah...don't hurt the girls or our synth' :)  Props to all you reading this that attended, no Props to all you that didn't, cept for Chloe cuz she rocks anyways, thanks for believing in me Girl....and yeah you too Janelle :) (thought I forgot about you eh?)  So what about Anberlin, well when they went up ...Ellen and I moved back, so that we wouldn't be stuck in the moshing again :).  Anberlin was really good though, I went in only moderately liking them, and came out loving the sound.  I can't wait to see them again when they come back with the juliana theory.

"261","780903","Student","                 The polished version of the ramblings below.  'Vanishing Act'  I could tolerate the cafeteria last year; but this year I dont know what happened.  One of my friends said something like that over dinner (not in the cafeteria, thankfully) a few nights ago.  And while it would give me a great excuse to write about the Hark and how Id rather Dean Kagans build a new shiny bathroom funds had gone to get some better food, thats not what it made me think about.  What happened to my cafeteria-hatin friend, to me, and to our 550-odd classmates is that we became 2Ls.  And being a 2L, compared with being a 1L, just isnt the same.  There are the obvious technical differences: we know where all the buildings are and the shortcuts for getting there, we know how to find old outlines, we know that until this year the coffee wasnt always free and that there werent always tampons in the womens bathrooms (actually, I dont really know that firsthand  but I take everyones word for it).  We know that 'mandatory meetings' arent really mandatory and that skimming that last chapter of reading doesnt make you a bad person.  Weve lost that feeling that sometimes hit in the back of the head that told us perhaps we ought to be outlining, forming a study group, briefing cases, stalking professors at their office hours, buying study guides, highlighting with more colors (side note: one firm I interviewed with gave out an awesomely-cool erasable highlighter.  One side is pink, the other side is white  when you rub the white side over the pink youve used, it vanishes.  This is almost as revolutionary as the combination tampon-highlighter theyll be giving out in the womens bathrooms come exam time.  Twenty minutes of amazement in the library before I could actually bring myself to stop erasing my highlights, leave the stuff highlighted, and turn the page.  Ive had the thing for twenty-four hours and its already out of ink.  I highlighted my entire TV Guide.) or (is this really still the same sentence?) calling our friends at other law schools to get them to search for our visiting professors old exams.  Not that we did any of that stuff.  But at least we wondered if we ought to be.  This year, no more.  I know people who havent opened their books yet  who havent bought their books yet.  I know people not on the seating chart.  I know people who dont remember what classes theyre in.  But more than that, theres an intensity change between 1L year and 2L year.  Last year, everything felt important, like it had stakes, like it had meaning, like it was real.  Ive got to do a journal, Ive got to send out resumes, Ive got to go to this meeting, Ive got to work on my memo, Ive got to brush my teeth twice a day.  It was easy to care about stuff, because everyone cared, and because the institutional culture told us to care.  This year, its harder.  We know that missing a meeting isnt criminal; that you can be on the executive board of XYZ club basically just by showing up, that the free food opportunities arent going anywhere.  Everyone passes his classes.  Everyone gets a job.  Everyone survives.  Theres not that I could fall off this cliff feeling of danger.  Our professors arent white tigers in a Vegas stage show.  And while thats comforting and stress-un-inducing, it does make 2L life a little less interesting.   And so weve lost the intensity  and at the same time, in some ways weve lost our community.  Our section, the same people in every class, the same experiences-in-common to talk about over crappy food at the cafeteria.  Weve all made friends, but its easier for days to elapse without seeing them, harder to find time-in-common, easier to go to class, go home, and check out.  Of course, part of this is the interviews.  They take up time, they take up energy, they take our pure souls and turn them into stone.  In some ways, the interviews have been cool though, because theyve helped to restore that missing sense of community, just a little bit.  [this section will look familiar to people who read what I wrote yesterday... but it's funny, so I'm using it again.  Ha!]  I pass you in a suit, we share a mutual glance.  I know exactly what youre doing.  In fact, there are people  some I know, some I don't  who've become  maybe just in my own head  sort of my interview comrades, apparently with the same class schedule as me (so that our interviews are at the same times) and with similar firm choices. I see them in the hospitality suites (you again?), in the hallways knocking, coming as I'm going, going as I'm coming, coming as I'm coming, and going as I'm going. There's glasses dude, scoop neck shirt girl, and green resume folder man, just to name a few.  Parts-hair-on-the-left guy, pretty earrings girl, four-fingered fellow, needs-some-Botox lady, always-looks-like-he-has-to-pee man, is-she-pregnant? woman, needs-a-shave dude, needs-a-shave ?girl?, looks-like-my-aunt guy, smells-like-peanut-butter madam, one-shoe-untied man, flabby-elbows girl, spinach-teeth guy, walks-like-a-robot lady, and picks-up-crumbs-from-the-floor-and-eats-them dude.  Just to name a few more.  But once interviews are done, this community too will vanish.  Like the 2Ls from the cafeteria.  And like the pink highlighting, once I use the special magic side of the highlighter that makes it all disappear.  I really like that highlighter.  I hope I get a callback.         ",0
"262","780903","Student","                 Okay, I started this yesterday and didn't get very far.  Sorry 'bout that.  Day 1 pasted from yesterday; everything else is brand spankin' new.    The 13-day Exam Survivor Challenge, as truncated from the 39-Day challenge I promised but quickly realized I can't actually deliver without this turning painful to read  DAY 1: They blindfold the class and take us on a boat, with just the clothes on our back (and our laptops with wireless Internet). We sail to a remote outpost of Madagascar and disembark, where we are faced with an instant elimination challenge. 10 multiple choice questions about the federal rules of evidence. The bottom 10% get C's and are fed to the piranhas. The rest of us are given some tools and told to build a big teepee. This will be our home for the next 38 days, or until we are eliminated.   DAY 2: Everyone's a little on edge; no one knows what's coming next. Three students are off in the corner, huddled around a Constitutional Law outline.  Four others are in the water fishing for dinner.  One student paces around camp muttering to himself about the rules of jurisdiction.  As the sun begins to set, we're told to put our books down and get ready for a reward challenge.  First person to list one hundred Supreme Court justices wins a copy of Gilbert's Administrative Law outline.  I lose.  DAY 3: We're told that there's an elimination exam this evening, but before we get there, we'll have to survive the dreaded 'day of distractions.'  First, we're tempted with delicious food that has only one catch: it's spiked with a laxative.  The more you eat, the more 'distracted' you'll be for the rest of the day studying and on into the exam.  For those not tempted by the food, our wireless Internet ports are activated, and scantily-clad law-school-dropouts-turned-models are brought onto the island to woo us away for a day on the beach.  The exam is all about the German constitution.  Everyone fails anyway.  The lowest 5 scores are fed to a wolf.  DAY 4: Vacation.  We get to watch the natives conduct their Supreme Court session.  Some find this interesting.  The rest of us sleep.  DAY 5: Punishment.  Forced to watch the new Tracy Morgan sitcom.  Over and over again.  Three students drown themselves.  Three others poke out their eyes with shells.  Disqualified.  DAY 6: Another exam, which is welcomed after 24 hours of unnecessary laugh track.  It's sad that sitcoms need laugh tracks.  If it was really funny, we'd know when to laugh.  Bottom 15% get a B- and are dropped from an airplane without a parachute.  Some of the less morally upright among us eat our fallen comrades.  The rest of us eat fish.  Again.  DAY 7: Reward challenge.  Anyone who can prove that he or she actually did all of the reading for the semester, carefully and without skipping any cases, gets an automatic A and gets to go home.  No one leaves.  DAY 8: An obstacle course.  Leap over stacks of casebooks.  Casebooks are too thick.  Most people lose.  DAY 9: Long and complicated issue spotter, acted out for us by local animals.  The monkey gets into an accident with the bird.  The bird suffers beak damage.  The monkey's attorney (a giraffe) attempts to link the bird's injury not to the accident with the monkey but to the inordinate amount of fast food crumbs the bird has been eating lately, trash from the local McDonalds.  4000-word essay on why birds shouldn't really eat Chicken McNuggets, from an ethical standpoint.  Bottom third get B's and are forced to be the new white meat inside the McNuggets.  DAY 10: They fly a member of each remaining student's family to the island to see how Grandma Ethel would do on the ELSAT (ELderly Scholastic Aptitude Test).  Through a complex set of rules, a third of the remaining contestants (and their grandmothers) are eliminated and get a B+ in the class.  They are forced to walk the plank into a tub of egg nog.  I don't know why egg nog.  It just seems like a relatively unpleasant liquid to have to swim in.  DAY 11: Only a few students are left.  They spend the day navigating a complex issue spotter.  At the end of the day, exhausted, they are told that their answers were lost and they have to start over.  It takes them each until the wee hours of the morning to finish.  The bottom half receive an A- and get pecked to death by man-eating birds.  DAY 12: The remaining contestants take a walk around the campsite to remember their fallen comrades.  We see clips of the students that once were, and hear excerpts from their terrible exam answers.  They are visited by Justice Souter, who tells them to hang in there one more day.  They sleep, wondering what will become of them on their final day on the island.  DAY 13: They wake up and are led to an arena where the locals are enjoying a bullfight.  They watch contestant after contestant get mauled, sure that this is soon to be their fate as well.  Finally, one bullfighter does not die, but is merely maimed.  The students are then told their challenge: oral arguments.  The most convincing defense will win an A+ and a shot to return next month for the Supreme Court Clerkship Challenge.  The rest will get an A in the class, and receive a free set of study guides as a delightful parting gift.  There is a winner.  The Exam Survivor Challenge comes to an end.    See?  Better than traditional finals, yes?      ",0
"263","780903","Student","                 Patrick Lewis over at  urlLink Ex Parte , the HLS Federalist Society weblog, writes, of a post of mine from a couple of weeks ago:  'Jeremy Blachman wonders why HLS GOP sponsored the law school blood drive. Since we know it isn't possible for Republicans to believe in good will toward men or charitable activities, the reason must be that Republicans are blood sucking vampires.'  Re-reading my post, I admit it wasn't clear what exactly I was implying -- but really the observation I wanted to make was why *any* political-minded organization -- right, left, or whatever direction anyone else is -- would be sponsoring the Blood Drive.  Like if the Environmental Law Society sponsored a conference on diversity.  It's not a *bad* thing of course; it just doesn't seem to have a heck of a lot to do with what they do.  But I suppose it could have been read in a bad way, so I've got no problem with the comment -- just thought I'd clarify.      ",0
"264","780903","Student","                  Week In Review: Concluding Thoughts on Harvard's Porn Magazine   This week, there was a bit of controversy as The Crimson announced, just in time for Valentine's Day, that Harvard had approved an undergraduate sex magazine.  We get an ice rink, they get naked pictures of each other.  Harvard quickly backtracked after the mainstream media firestorm made them realize maybe this wasn't a good idea.  'Where does your daughter go to school?'  'Harvard.'  'Oh, I knew that.  From this magazine I saw.'  Professors' seating charts would be so much more interesting.  I know, I know.  There simply aren't enough opportunities out there for Harvard students who want to appear naked in the pages of a magazine, on video, or on the Internet, and it really is the school's duty to make sure there's a forum on campus for students who want to foreclose all opportunities to run for political office in the future, or to look their grandparents in the eye ever again.  'Honey, you've always been good at writing.  Why don't you join a campus magazine.'  'Well, okay.  How about---?'  'NO!  NOT THAT ONE!'  'But I would just be joining it for the articles.'  Actually, I shouldn't have said the magazine was announced just in time for Valentine's Day.  It was actually just in time for Presidents Day, in honor of President Clinton.  Or maybe in honor of John Kerry, if the Internet rumors are true and he did in fact receive botox injections from an intern.  I may be getting two rumors confused.  The magazine may also have been in honor of Dennis Kucinich, who continues his search for love on the campaign trail with an appearance on Blind Date next week.  The Law School is saving its announcement about a similarly-themed new magazine for Halloween.  Or maybe Lent.  Ten points if that makes sense to you, because I'm not even sure it makes sense to me.  A Law School magazine like that would be kind of cool.  Instead of scanning for the highest grades, law firms could scan for, uh, other things.  Perhaps some students could get pro bono credit for posing, and others could get arrested.  It could be run by the Legal Aid Bureau; it's just a different kind of Aid than they're used to.  Yeah.  I think I've pretty much run out of steam on this topic.      ",0

"269","780903","Student","                 Some thoughts on law school extra-curricular activities... I volunteered yesterday to help out with the admitted students weekend activities fair for the a cappella singing group I'm in.  I sat at our table for an hour or so, giving out copies of our fall show program to any interested students, and answering any questions people had.  But mostly just enjoying the free cookies, pretzels, popcorn, and Nantucket Nectar drinks they had.  Admitted students get treated well before they send their deposits.  We got a total of 4 interested students to sign up for our non-existent mailing list.  Including an unfortunate girl whose first name rhymed with her last name.  But what I foudn most interesting was that probably 15 out of the 50 or so students manning tables were people who'd been in the Parody show.  Out of 1800 students in the law school, the odds that 15 of 50 would be from among the 50 people in the Parody show are probably pretty steep.  (A probability shareware program I just located on the web and downloaded -- look at how dedicated I am -- tells me the odds are 4.04 x 10^(-12) of 15 or more out of 50 students manning tables would be from the Parody cast of 50 out of 1800 students.  So, yes, the odds are pretty steep.  Apologies if I screwed up the calculation somewhere.)  The explanation is that of course it's not random chance -- the people who did the Parody show were people who were willing to rehearse four hours a night for a month.  There may not be a tremendous set of people here who are willing and interested in doing that, at the potential expense of staying on top of their schoolwork.  And, by and large, people heavily involved in other organizations -- to enough of an extent that they'd be sitting a recruiting table for it -- are also people from this subgroup of law students willing to put time into extracurricular activities.  Because these 'joiners' are limited in number, and because many have more than one interest they're eager to pursue, there's lots of repetition.  One of my friends manning a table yesterday agreed with this distinction of joiners vs. non-joiners.  He's a 2L, and laughed when I said I was surprised to see so many familiar faces.  'What you haven't realized yet,' he said, 'is that every organization here is the same group of people, just with different positions.'  Perhaps that's not completely the case, but it many be closer than intuition places it.  After all, there were Parody cast members at tables for the newspaper, the Latin-American students organization, the Big Brother-Big Sister group, and lots of others.    So, the point I'm trying to make... law school has 'joiners' and 'non-joiners.'  I think it would be interesting to see a study done comparing overall happiness, grades, and future success among the two groups (with the distinction between the two groups being, say, involvement in a substantive way (having a position with a title) in at least one activity and involvement in some way with at least one additional activity as the definition for a 'joiner').  My hunch would be that joiners would be substantially happier, and peraps even have better grades -- in part because happy, busy, fulfilled people probably do better, and in part because people who are able to balance schoolwork with some extracurricular activities might just be better and quicker at the academic stuff.  I wonder if people at other schools feel this same 'joiner' / 'non-joiner' distinction as sharply as I've noticed it here...        ",0

"271","772682","Arts","           I am stealing Jen's blog, then adding my own thoughts because its a lot easier to cut and paste someone's thoughts that were a lot fresher when they wrote it, then trying to recall... Jens blog can be found here in its completeness: www.livejournal.com/users/sheilahmcpaste  The Halloween bar loop in Wilmington! Featuring: LAURIE as The Butterfly KAREN as Can-can girl MIRANDA as The Scandalous Winged Woodland Creature MELISSA as Greek Goddess NATE as Hula girl and JEN as The Spooky Spider Lady  We hit two bars around Logan House, one was full of people twenty years older than us and the other had Melissa and Miranda and I pinned to the ledge the whole time. On the way to bar #2 we were talking about the 48 year old lady who had the same wings as Laurie, and how bitchy she was being, saying 'My mask is better, you're not authentic, I've been here longer' and how she should have said in reply 'Yeah you've been here twenty years longer'. Then we look up to see Miranda and Melissa running down the street, Miranda trying to lift her ass onto a covered motorcycle on the sidewalk, the alarm going off, and the two of them running down the rest of the street. Fabulous :)  Logan House had an hour wait, so we decided to pile in Nate's car and head for the Waterfront. First though, Melissa had to pee, so her and Miranda ran up the steep hill by the parking lot to do their duty. Next thing I know Melissa's trying to walk down and ends up rolling down the hill at top speed onto my feet. Classic. Turns out our poor buddy was pretty hurt when the buzz wore off, and is on crutches. Hang in there Aphrodite! Kahunaville was fun, Miranda wiping out on the sidewalk in front and exposing all was even more fun. Next was Iron Hill, where I violated Melissa and Karen and I spent some quality time in the bathroom. My Halloween buddies say that I'm a good drunk :-D Good drunk or not, the 'Vamprie Shot' that Miranda and I finished with completely did me in, and I'm completely gone still. Fantastic!  Word of the night: SCANDALOUS  Yeah, that pretty much sums that night up.  Except that I don't think I was running as much as Jen said I was.  And I don't know why I tried to get on the motorcycle...it was there and it wanted a rider.  As soon as I tried getting on it (the operative word there is 'tried') a pansy ass alarm went off.  Woo Woo Woo!!  Pansy enough to make us high tail it to Scratch McGoos though.   Also, I will explain Melissa's injury further.  Melissa had to go to the bathroom so I told her to go in the woods instead of waiting in line somewhere else, and I told her I would go up the treacherous hill with her if she needed.  So we go up the mountian, in privacy, since where she was standing there was no privacy.  We're up the hill and the next thing I know, I see this little white and gold toga careening down the hill and stopping abruptly in front of the car.  Man, that was the funniest thing that night.  Poor Melissa!!!  So we pile in Nate's car and go to Kahuna.  Melissa does the Percolater (its a bad bad bad dance from the middle school era) quite well for being an itty bitty white girl.  I honestly think that's how she sprained her ankle, not falling down a hill.  After Kahuna we walked to Iron Hill, where I proceded to walk just fine.  I don't know how I busted ass, but the next thing I know I am on the ground, and it was so funny because I didn't trip or anything, it was a perfetly flat surface.  And on the way back up, the crew saw a lot more than I intended.  Sorry guys. At Iron Hill Jen and I did this shot, which not a smart idea.  Vampire Shot from Hell it should have been called.  Plastered at this point, so there is no where else to go but the diner.   Enough to go home, sleep a few, then work the record store....         ",0

"286","734562","Arts","            my good friend john robinson asked me an excellent question about a month ago, on the road to ohio: 'ben, are you voting  for  john kerry, or just  against  george bush?'  i replied, 'i'm voting against bush.  i don't know kerry, but i know bush.'   john, thank you for that question; but i've changed my mind as of last night.  i'm voting  for  kerry, now, and have volunteered to work for his campaign here in virginia.    We are here tonight because we love our country.   We are proud of what America is and what it can become.   My fellow Americans: we are here tonight united in one simple purpose: to make America stronger at home and respected in the world.  A great American novelist wrote that you can't go home again.  He could not have imagined this evening.  Tonight, I am home. Home where my public life began and those who made it possible live.  Home where our nation's history was written in blood, idealism, and hope.  Home where my parents showed me the values of family, faith, and country.  Thank you, all of you, for a welcome home I will never forget.   I wish my parents could share this moment.  They went to their rest in the last few years, but their example, their inspiration, their gift of open eyes, open mind, and endless world are bigger and more lasting than any words.  I was born in Colorado, in Fitzsimmons Army Hospital, when my dad was a pilot in World War II.  Now, I'm not one to read into things, but guess which wing of the hospital the maternity ward was in?  I'm not making this up.  I was born in the West Wing!  My mother was the rock of our family as so many mothers are. She stayed up late to help me do my homework. She sat by my bed when I was sick, and she answered the questions of a child who, like all children, found the world full of wonders and mysteries.  She was my den mother when I was a Cub Scout and she was so proud of her fifty year pin as a Girl Scout leader. She gave me her passion for the environment.  She taught me to see trees as the cathedrals of nature. And by the power of her example, she showed me that we can and must finish the march toward full equality for all women in our country.   My dad did the things that a boy remembers.  He gave me my first model airplane, my first baseball mitt and my first bicycle.  He also taught me that we are here for something bigger than ourselves; he lived out the responsibilities and sacrifices of the greatest generation to whom we owe so much.    When I was a young man, he was in the State Department, stationed in Berlin when it and the world were divided between democracy and communism. I have unforgettable memories of being a kid mesmerized by the British, French, and American troops, each of them guarding their own part of the city, and Russians standing guard on the stark line separating East from West. On one occasion, I rode my bike into Soviet East Berlin. And when I proudly told my dad, he promptly grounded me.   But what I learned has stayed with me for a lifetime. I saw how different life was on different sides of the same city. I saw the fear in the eyes of people who were not free.  I saw the gratitude of people toward the United States for all that we had done. I felt goose bumps as I got off a military train and heard the Army band strike up 'Stars and Stripes Forever.'  I learned what it meant to be America at our best. I learned the pride of our freedom.  And I am determined now to restore that pride to all who look to America.   Mine were greatest generation parents. And as I thank them, we all join together to thank that whole generation for making America strong, for winning World War II, winning the Cold War, and for the great gift of service which brought America fifty years of peace and prosperity.     My parents inspired me to serve, and when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service.  It was the beginning of a great journey  a time to march for civil rights, for voting rights, for the environment, for women, and for peace. We believed we could change the world. And you know what? We did.   But we're not finished. The journey isn't complete.  The march isn't over.  The promise isn't perfected.   Tonight, we're setting out again.  And together, we're going to write the next great chapter of America's story.   We have it in our power to change the world again.  But only if we're true to our ideals  and that starts by telling the truth to the American people. That is my first pledge to you tonight.  As President, I will restore trust and credibility to the White House.  I ask you to judge me by my record:  As a young prosecutor, I fought for victim's rights and made prosecuting violence against women a priority.  When I came to the Senate, I broke with many in my own party to vote for a balanced budget, because I thought it was the right thing to do.  I fought to put a 100,000 cops on the street.  And then I reached across the aisle to work with John McCain, to find the truth about our POW's and missing in action, and to finally make peace with Vietnam.     I will be a commander in chief who will never mislead us into war.  I will have a Vice President who will not conduct secret meetings with polluters to rewrite our environmental laws.  I will have a Secretary of Defense who will listen to the best advice of our military leaders.   And I will appoint an Attorney General who actually upholds the Constitution of the United States.   My fellow Americans, this is the most important election of our lifetime. The stakes are high. We are a nation at war  a global war on terror against an enemy unlike any we have ever known before. And here at home, wages are falling, health care costs are rising, and our great middle class is shrinking. People are working weekends; they're working two jobs, three jobs, and they're still not getting ahead.   We're told that outsourcing jobs is good for America. We're told that new jobs that pay $9,000 less than the jobs that have been lost is the best we can do.  They say this is the best economy we've ever had.  And they say that anyone who thinks otherwise is a pessimist.  Well, here is our answer:  There is nothing more pessimistic than saying America can't do better.   We can do better and we will.  We're the optimists. For us, this is a country of the future. We're the can do people.  And let's not forget what we did in the 1990s. We balanced the budget. We paid down the debt.  We created 23 million new jobs. We lifted millions out of poverty and we lifted the standard of living for the middle class. We just need to believe in ourselves  and we can do it again.   So tonight, in the city where America's freedom began, only a few blocks from where the sons and daughters of liberty gave birth to our nation  here tonight, on behalf of a new birth of freedom  on behalf of the middle class who deserve a champion, and those struggling to join it who deserve a fair shot  for the brave men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day and the families who pray for their return  for all those who believe our best days are ahead of us  for all of you  with great faith in the American people, I accept your nomination for President of the United States.   I am proud that at my side will be a running mate whose life is the story of the American dream and who's worked every day to make that dream real for all Americans  Senator John Edwards of North Carolina. And his wonderful wife Elizabeth and their family. This son of a mill worker is ready to lead  and next January, Americans will be proud to have a fighter for the middle class to succeed Dick Cheney as Vice President of the United States.   And what can I say about Teresa?  She has the strongest moral compass of anyone I know. She's down to earth, nurturing, courageous, wise and smart.  She speaks her mind and she speaks the truth, and I love her for that, too. And that's why America will embrace her as the next First Lady of the United States.   For Teresa and me, no matter what the future holds or the past has given us, nothing will ever mean as much as our children. We love them not just for who they are and what they've become, but for being themselves, making us laugh, holding our feet to the fire, and never letting me get away with anything.  Thank you, Andre, Alex, Chris, Vanessa, and John.  And in this journey, I am accompanied by an extraordinary band of brothers led by that American hero, a patriot named Max Cleland.  Our band of brothers doesn't march together because of who we are as veterans, but because of what we learned as soldiers. We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.  We may be a little older now, we may be a little grayer, but we still know how to fight for our country.   And standing with us in that fight are those who shared with me the long season of the primary campaign:  Carol Moseley Braun, General Wesley Clark, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt, Bob Graham, Dennis Kucinich, Joe Lieberman and Al Sharpton.   To all of you, I say thank you for teaching me and testing me  but mostly, we say thank you for standing up for our country and giving us the unity to move America forward.   My fellow Americans, the world tonight is very different from the world of four years ago. But I believe the American people are more than equal to the challenge.   Remember the hours after September 11th, when we came together as one to answer the attack against our homeland. We drew strength when our firefighters ran up the stairs and risked their lives, so that others might live. When rescuers rushed into smoke and fire at the Pentagon.  When the men and women of Flight 93 sacrificed themselves to save our nation's Capitol. When flags were hanging from front porches all across America, and strangers became friends. It was the worst day we have ever seen, but it brought out the best in all of us.    I am proud that after September 11th all our people rallied to President Bush's call for unity to meet the danger. There were no Democrats.  There were no Republicans. There were only Americans.  How we wish it had stayed that way.   Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities  and I do  because some issues just aren't all that simple.  Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so.  Saying we can fight a war on the cheap doesnt make it so. And proclaiming mission accomplished certainly doesn't make it so.    As President, I will ask hard questions and demand hard evidence.  I will immediately reform the intelligence system  so policy is guided by facts, and facts are never distorted by politics.  And as President, I will bring back this nation's time-honored tradition: the United States of America never goes to war because we want to, we only go to war because we have to.  I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place and they can't tell friend from foe.  I know what they go through when they're out on patrol at night and they don't know what's coming around the next bend. I know what it's like to write letters home telling your family that everything's all right when you're not sure that's true.    As President, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war.  Before you go to battle, you have to be able to look a parent in the eye and truthfully say: 'I tried everything possible to avoid sending your son or daughter into harm's way. But we had no choice. We had to protect the American people, fundamental American values from a threat that was real and imminent.'  So lesson one, this is the only justification for going to war.   And on my first day in office, I will send a message to every man and woman in our armed forces: You will never be asked to fight a war without a plan to win the peace.  I know what we have to do in Iraq.  We need a President who has the credibility to bring our allies to our side and share the burden, reduce the cost to American taxpayers, and reduce the risk to American soldiers.  That's the right way to get the job done and bring our troops home.   Here is the reality: that won't happen until we have a president who restores America's respect and leadership -- so we don't have to go it alone in the world.    And we need to rebuild our alliances, so we can get the terrorists before they get us.    I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as President.  Let there be no mistake:  I will never hesitate to use force when it is required.  Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response. I will never give any nation or international institution a veto over our national security.  And I will build a stronger American military.  We will add 40,000 active duty troops  not in Iraq, but to strengthen American forces that are now overstretched, overextended, and under pressure. We will double our special forces to conduct anti-terrorist operations. We will provide our troops with the newest weapons and technology to save their lives  and win the battle.  And we will end the backdoor draft of National Guard and reservists.  To all who serve in our armed forces today, I say, help is on the way.   As President, I will fight a smarter, more effective war on terror. We will deploy every tool in our arsenal: our economic as well as our military might; our principles as well as our firepower.    In these dangerous days there is a right way and a wrong way to be strong. Strength is more than tough words. After decades of experience in national security, I know the reach of our power and I know the power of our ideals.  We need to make America once again a beacon in the world. We need to be looked up to and not just feared.    We need to lead a global effort against nuclear proliferation  to keep the most dangerous weapons in the world out of the most dangerous hands in the world.     We need a strong military and we need to lead strong alliances.  And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.  The future doesn't belong to fear; it belongs to freedom.    And the front lines of this battle are not just far away  they're right here on our shores, at our airports, and potentially in any town or city. Today, our national security begins with homeland security. The 9-11 Commission has given us a path to follow, endorsed by Democrats, Republicans, and the 9-11 families.  As President, I will not evade or equivocate; I will immediately implement the recommendations of that commission.  We shouldn't be letting ninety-five percent of container ships come into our ports without ever being physically inspected.  We shouldn't be leaving our nuclear and chemical plants without enough protection.  And we shouldn't be opening firehouses in Baghdad and closing them down in the United States of America.   And tonight, we have an important message for those who question the patriotism of Americans who offer a better direction for our country.  Before wrapping themselves in the flag and shutting their eyes and ears to the truth, they should remember what America is really all about. They should remember the great idea of freedom for which so many have given their lives.  Our purpose now is to reclaim democracy itself. We are here to affirm that when Americans stand up and speak their minds and say America can do better, that is not a challenge to patriotism; it is the heart and soul of patriotism.   You see that flag up there.  We call her Old Glory. The stars and stripes forever. I fought under that flag, as did so many of you here and all across our country. That flag flew from the gun turret right behind my head. It was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men I served with and friends I grew up with.  For us, that flag is the most powerful symbol of who we are and what we believe in. Our strength. Our diversity. Our love of country. All that makes America both great and good.   That flag doesn't belong to any president. It doesn't belong to any ideology and it doesn't belong to any political party. It belongs to all the American people.   My fellow citizens, elections are about choices. And choices are about values.  In the end, it's not just policies and programs that matter; the president who sits at that desk must be guided by principle.   For four years, we've heard a lot of talk about values. But values spoken without actions taken are just slogans.  Values are not just words.  They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.   You don't value families by kicking kids out of after school programs and taking cops off our streets, so that Enron can get another tax break.   We believe in the family value of caring for our children and protecting the neighborhoods where they walk and play.    And that is the choice in this election.   You don't value families by denying real prescription drug coverage to seniors, so big drug companies can get another windfall.    We believe in the family value expressed in one of the oldest Commandments: 'Honor thy father and thy mother.'  As President, I will not privatize Social Security. I will not cut benefits. And together, we will make sure that senior citizens never have to cut their pills in half because they can't afford life-saving medicine.     And that is the choice in this election.  You don't value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service, if you deny veterans health care, or if you tell middle class families to wait for a tax cut, so that the wealthiest among us can get even more.  We believe in the value of doing what's right for everyone in the American family.   And that is the choice in this election.   We believe that what matters most is not narrow appeals masquerading as values, but the shared values that show the true face of America.  Not narrow appeals that divide us, but shared values that unite us.  Family and faith.  Hard work and responsibility. Opportunity for all  so that every child, every parent, every worker has an equal shot at living up to their God-given potential.  What does it mean in America today when Dave McCune, a steel worker I met in Canton, Ohio, saw his job sent overseas and the equipment in his factory literally unbolted, crated up, and shipped thousands of miles away along with that job?  What does it mean when workers I've met had to train their foreign replacements?    America can do better.  So tonight we say: help is on the way.  What does it mean when Mary Ann Knowles, a woman with breast cancer I met in New Hampshire, had to keep working day after day right through her chemotherapy, no matter how sick she felt, because she was terrified of losing her family's health insurance.   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when Deborah Kromins from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania works and saves all her life only to find out that her pension has disappeared into thin air  and the executive who looted it has bailed out on a golden parachute?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when twenty five percent of the children in Harlem have asthma because of air pollution?   America can do better.  And help is on the way.  What does it mean when people are huddled in blankets in the cold, sleeping in Lafayette Park on the doorstep of the White House itself  and the number of families living in poverty has risen by three million in the last four years?    America can do better.  And help is on the way.  And so we come here tonight to ask: Where is the conscience of our country?   I'll tell you where it is: it's in rural and small town America; it's in urban neighborhoods and suburban main streets; it's alive in the people I've met in every part of this land. It's bursting in the hearts of Americans who are determined to give our country back its values and its truth.   We value jobs that pay you more not less than you earned before.  We value jobs where, when you put in a week's work, you can actually pay your bills, provide for your children, and lift up the quality of your life.  We value an America where the middle class is not being squeezed, but doing better.   So here is our economic plan to build a stronger America:    First, new incentives to revitalize manufacturing.    Second, investment in technology and innovation that will create the good-paying jobs of the future.    Third, close the tax loopholes that reward companies for shipping our jobs overseas.  Instead, we will reward companies that create and keep good paying jobs where they belong  in the good old U.S.A.    We value an America that exports products, not jobs  and we believe American workers should never have to subsidize the loss of their own job.   Next, we will trade and compete in the world.  But our plan calls for a fair playing field  because if you give the American worker a fair playing field, there's nobody in the world the American worker can't compete against.    And we're going to return to fiscal responsibility because it is the foundation of our economic strength.  Our plan will cut the deficit in half in four years by ending tax giveaways that are nothing more than corporate welfare  and will make government live by the rule that every family has to follow: pay as you go.    And let me tell you what we won't do: we won't raise taxes on the middle class. You've heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.   Our education plan for a stronger America sets high standards and demands accountability from parents, teachers, and schools. It provides for smaller class sizes and treats teachers like the professionals they are. And it gives a tax credit to families for each and every year of college.  When I was a prosecutor, I met young kids who were in trouble, abandoned by adults.  And as President, I am determined that we stop being a nation content to spend $50,000 a year to keep a young person in prison for the rest of their life  when we could invest $10,000 to give them Head Start, Early Start, Smart Start, the best possible start in life.  And we value health care that's affordable and accessible for all Americans.  Since 2000, four million people have lost their health insurance. Millions more are struggling to afford it.   You know what's happening. Your premiums, your co-payments, your deductibles have all gone through the roof.  Our health care plan for a stronger America cracks down on the waste, greed, and abuse in our health care system and will save families up to $1,000 a year on their premiums.  You'll get to pick your own doctor  and patients and doctors, not insurance company bureaucrats, will make medical decisions.  Under our plan, Medicare will negotiate lower drug prices for seniors. And all Americans will be able to buy less expensive prescription drugs from countries like Canada.    The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it's not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I'm here to say, your family's health care is just as important as any politician's in Washington, D.C.  And when I'm President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected  it is a right for all Americans.   We value an America that controls its own destiny because it's finally and forever independent of Mideast oil.  What does it mean for our economy and our national security when we only have three percent of the world's oil reserves, yet we rely on foreign countries for fifty-three percent of what we consume?    I want an America that relies on its own ingenuity and innovation  not the Saudi royal family.   And our energy plan for a stronger America will invest in new technologies and alternative fuels and the cars of the future -- so that no young American in uniform will ever be held hostage to our dependence on oil from the Middle East.  I've told you about our plans for the economy, for education, for health care, for energy independence.  I want you to know more about them.  So now I'm going to say something that Franklin Roosevelt could never have said in his acceptance speech:  go to johnkerry.com.  I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let's be optimists, not just opponents. Let's build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let's honor this nation's diversity; let's respect one another; and let's never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.   My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks. This is our time to reject the kind of politics calculated to divide race from race, group from group, region from region. Maybe some just see us divided into red states and blue states, but I see us as one America  red, white, and blue. And when I am President, the government I lead will enlist people of talent, Republicans as well as Democrats, to find the common ground  so that no one who has something to contribute will be left on the sidelines.  And let me say it plainly: in that cause, and in this campaign, we welcome people of faith. America is not us and them. I think of what Ron Reagan said of his father a few weeks ago, and I want to say this to you tonight: I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. And whatever our faith, one belief should bind us all: The measure of our character is our willingness to give of ourselves for others and for our country.  These aren't Democratic values. These aren't Republican values. They're American values.  We believe in them. They're who we are. And if we honor them, if we believe in ourselves, we can build an America that's stronger at home and respected in the world.   So much promise stretches before us. Americans have always reached for the impossible, looked to the next horizon, and asked: What if?   Two young bicycle mechanics from Dayton asked what if this airplane could take off at Kitty Hawk?  It did that and changed the world forever.  A young president asked what if we could go to the moon in ten years?  And now we're exploring the solar system and the stars themselves.  A young generation of entrepreneurs asked, what if we could take all the information in a library and put it on a little chip the size of a fingernail?  We did and that too changed the world forever.  And now it's our time to ask: What if?   What if we find a breakthrough to cure Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and AIDs?  What if we have a president who believes in science, so we can unleash the wonders of discovery like stem cell research to treat illness and save millions of lives?   What if we do what adults should do  and make sure all our children are safe in the afternoons after school?  And what if we have a leadership that's as good as the American dream  so that bigotry and hatred never again steal the hope and future of any American?  I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta with young Americans who came from places as different as Iowa and Oregon, Arkansas, Florida and California.  No one cared where we went to school.  No one cared about our race or our backgrounds. We were literally all in the same boat. We looked out, one for the other  and we still do.   That is the kind of America I will lead as President  an America where we are all in the same boat.   Never has there been a more urgent moment for Americans to step up and define ourselves. I will work my heart out.  But, my fellow citizens, the outcome is in your hands more than mine.    It is time to reach for the next dream.  It is time to look to the next horizon.  For America, the hope is there.  The sun is rising.  Our best days are still to come.    Goodnight, God bless you, and God bless America.    urlLink johnkerry.com           ",0
"287","734562","Arts","           You're right -- success does affect my opinion.  I mean...there was a time when I thought Titanic was the greatest American film ever made.  Changed my life.  Then it made all that money, and boy did *that* change my tune!  And how about Gladiator?  My god, what a masterpiece!  Then the success, and the awards...I see a clip from it now and I'm filled with unbridled rage.  What a crazy monkey am I!  Of course, I saw both of these, so my point is undermined....but give me some credit -- the success or failure of any work has no effect on my personal taste.  What I am reacting to is marketing -- and I will be the first to admit that my choices are affected by marketing, usually to the negative, since if I see it everywhere, all the time, and I gotta love it love it love it, as has been and continues to be shoved in my face re: Greek Wedding, I'm going to be really turned off, even if it is f*ing Citizen Kane.  That may be irrational, and it may be unfair, but it's my choice, and I'm happy to blame it on the studio, and too bad for the filmmaker who let it happen, because if an artist puts his or her foot down, it doesn't have to be that way.  I don't like being treated like a six-year-old, which is what the studio has done and continues to do, and it's a shame that what may be a fine little movie bears the brunt of my reaction, but sometimes that's just the breaks in this devil's deal we call art and commerce.  Dance too close to media saturation, and you get burned.  A lesson for artists everywhere.         ",0
"288","734562","Arts","           Ben - If that was intended as a response to my question, it failed.  I'm not asking what an anti-Bush website thinks about it, I'm asking what my fellow bloggers think about it.  In response to the website, for us, the USA, to think that space will remain unmilitarized forever is naive.  Especially since out good buddies in the Peoples Republic of China are rapidly developing their own space program, and I believe have announced plans for a moon mission (though my memory is vague on that).  They see us as a threat, rightly or wrongly, and we must be prepared.  Someone told me that space exploration is alot like having kids; if you wait until you are ready, it will never happen.  I can see his point.  We, the human species, have been trying to solve some of these pressing social problems (poverty, injustice) for about 3000 years now.

"301","718029","Non-Profit","       May 3, 2004  I am back! Yes, the good me, the amazing me - the  real  me is back. I didn't manage to wake up at 5am this morning (I was awake until around 2:30am), but I still got up and followed my nutrition plan and hoisted myself on the treadmill for over 45 minutes (3.75 miles, 420 calories). I'm going to do my upper body workout with weights as soon as I take this little water/blogging break, too. The thing that always irritates me is how good I feel when I live the way I am supposed to live. Why, then, is it so hard to maintain? When I was six weeks into Body-For-Life, I felt incredible. Better than I had ever felt, and not just because I was losing weight and was on an emotional high. No, I could see wild changes in my body, even underneath the fat I still had to lose. I could see weird and wonderful curves taking shape in my arms. I had energy and stamina. My mind was clearer.   Even now, after more than two months off the wagon, I can still hoist Henry around and carry him indefinitely without feeling tired or achy - which Eug can't do. The muscle tissue is still with me. Diminished, perhaps, but there nonetheless. The body is a wondrous thing. So, starting today from the beginning, I will finish my first twelve weeks at the end of July. I don't really want to talk about my goals, but then maybe I should. The thing is, I don't want to have any personal conversations about what I'm doing. I have trouble discussing these things in person and doing so sometimes has strange emotional effects on me. So I guess I won't say too much more other than that I feel good to have done something today that makes me feel proud of myself. Enough said.  Now, let's see - when last I left you, illness was still afoot in our household. Thankfully, everything appears to have passed, but not without a trip to the ER for IV fluids (which deserves its own full-fledged rant, but I don't feel like dredging up all those feelings again). Henry is his charming, energetic self again. Xanthe looks bright-eyed and bushy-tailed once more. Eug and I feel great. Heck, if anybody wants to get together with us, you'd better speak up before the next wave of germs hits us!   There is one funny thing going on, though. By funny I mean strange - but in a perfectly normal way. Yes, you read that right: strange in a normal way, LOL. Henry is going through some kind of a fear period. He has anxieties about things that never bothered him before. He was walking with Eug through the Target parking lot yesterday (holding hands, of course) and he would get really nervous and yell in a very upset tone of voice at any nearby car - like he thought they were going to run him over. Nothing Eug or I said made any difference. He was genuinely worried. Then, he had a full-scale freak-out when our Terminix guy (hey, it's part of life on a slab foundation - it's you vs. the bugs) showed up and was walking around the perimeter of our house. Poor kid. He was wide-eyed and shaking, just like something out of a horror movie. I tried to be comforting but at the same time upbeat and friendly to show him there was nothing to worry about.   And Xanthe's making mobility progress! She sits like a champ for loooong periods of time, contentedly playing with toys. Best of all, if you give her something REALLY exciting to do, she will stand against the side of the couch, bathtub, etc. Whew. Thank goodness, I say.   I'm also thinking of getting a ridiculously expensive double stroller, because I can no longer stand what I've got. I told Eug I would be willing to sell off everything but the single Peg Perego Milano XL *and* consider this purchase good for both Mother's Day and my birthday gifts, unless I make at least $200 at the family garage sale this year. Can't say as I blame him, as the stroller I want is a whopping $545.00. But I am sick of having eighteen strollers for everything. I want one that does it all, and with no shitty squeaky wheels, broken plastic parts or seats that don't recline for sleeping children. I want quality and durability. And that, my friends, means the range of choices is indeed narrow if you're talking double strollers. Since I have learned the hard way that the ONLY way to go with a double is a side-by-side, but you still need your SBS to be no narrow enough for everyday use...well, that narrows it down even more. Which brings us to... urlLink The Mountain Buggy Urban Double!  Yes, I want it in the chocolate color, too. Yummy. I'm still of two minds about the fact that it doesn't have that whole front bar with cupholder crapola for kiddies. But we'll see. There's good reason people flip their lid for this contraption.  That's it for now. Thanks for stopping by.         ",0

"305","705633","Technology","           Hangover Star Ratings   1 Star Hangover *  No pain. No real feeling of illness. Your sleep last night was a mere 'disco nap', which is giving you a whole lot of misplaced energy. Still able to function relatively well. However, you can drink 10 bottles of water and still feel as parched as the Sahara. Even vegetarians are craving a bacon buttie with chips.    2 Star Hangover * *  No pain, but something is definitely amiss. You may look okay but you have the attention span and mental capacity of a stapler. The coffee you hug to try to remain focused is only exacerbating your rumbling guts, which are craving a Full English Breakfast. Although you have a nice demeanour about the office, you are costing your employer valuable money because all you really can handle is some light filing, followed by aimlessly surfing the net and writing junk e-mails.   3 Star Hangover * * *  Slight headache. Stomach feels crappy. You are definitely a space-cadet and so not productive. Anytime someone walks by, you gag because their perfume/aftershave reminds you of the andom gin-shots you did with your alcoholic friends after the bouncer kicked you out at 1:45 a.m. Life would be better right now if you were in your bed with dozen doughnuts and a litre of coke watching Trisha. You've had 4 cups of coffee, a gallon of water, 2 sausage rolls and a litre of diet coke yet you haven't peed once.   4 Star Hangover * * * *  You have lost the will to live. Your head is throbbing and you can't speak too quickly or you might honk. Your boss has already lambasted you for being late and has given you a lecture for  reeking of booze. You wore nice clothes, but that can't hide the fact that you either missed an oh-so crucial spot shaving or it looks like you put your make-up on while riding the dodgems, depending on your gender. Your teeth have sweaters, your eyes look like one big vein and your hairstyle makes you look like a reject from the class picture of Moss Side secondary modern school circa 1976. You would give a week's pay for one the following:   * Home time  * A Doner Kebab and somewhere to be alone  * A time machine so you could go back and NOT have gone out the night before.   5 Star Hangover * * * * *  You have a second heartbeat in your head, which is actually annoying the employee who sits next to you. Vodka vapour is seeping out of every pore and making you dizzy You still have toothpaste-crust in the corners of your mouth. Your body has lost the ability to create saliva, so your tongue is suffocating you. You'd cry but that would take the last of the moisture left in your body. Death seems like a pretty good option right now. Your boss doesn't even get cross and your co-workers think that your dog must have just died because you look so pathetic. You should have called in sick because, let's face it, all you can manage to do is breathe . . .Very gently.   6 Star Hangover * * * * * *  You arrive home and climb into bed. Sleep comes instantly; as you were fighting it all the way home in the taxi You get about 2 hours sleep and the noises inside your head wake you up. You notice that your bed has been cleared for take-off and is flying relentlessly around the room. No matter what you do you know you're going to chuck. You stumble out of bed and now find that your room is in a yacht under full sail. After walking along the skirting boards on alternating walls, knocking all the pictures off, you find the dunny If you are lucky you will remember to lift the lid before you spontaneously explode and wake the whole house up with your impersonation of walrus mating calls. You sit there on the floor in your undies, cuddling the only friend in the world you have left (the toilet), randomly continuing to make the walrus noises, spitting and farting... Help usually comes at this stage, even if it is short lived. Tears stream down your face and your abdomen hurts. Help now turns into abuse and it goes back to bed leaving you there in the dark. With your stomach totally empty, your spontaneous eruptions have died back to 15-minute intervals, but your body won't relent. You are convinced that you are starting to turn yourself inside out and swear that you saw your bum come out of your mouth on the last occasion. You lie there cold and shivering, with eruptions now occurring at 1 hour intervals. It is now dawn and you pass your disgusted partner getting up for the day as you try to climb into bed. You are abused again for trying to get into bed with lumpy bits of dried vomit in your hair. You reluctantly accept the advice and have a shower in exchange for her driving you to the hospital. The whole day spent (as hangover 4 star) you finally feel well enough to eat again on the following day, with the mention of alcohol making your stomach churn lasts for a week and publicly you vow never to do it again.   I'm about two stars today. Not bad considering.         ",0

"307","701683","Non-Profit","                 I've always wondered how to accurately express this unconditional love of Christ--so pure, so true, so powerful, so perfect, so overwhelming.  Well, for a time I was quite discouraged because there is really no way we can do such a daunting task.  Ya' know what I'm sayin?  However, I believe I stumbled across someone who has at least begun to pick the lock to this truth.  The fella'?...a A.W. Tozer.  Check this out...    I can do no more justice to the awesome wonder-filled theme called love than a child can grasp a star.  Still, by reaching toward the star the child may call attention to it and even indicate the direction one might look to see it.  So, as I stretch my heart toward the high, shining love of God, someone who has not before known about it may be encouraged to look up and have hope.    So beautifully put!  Trying to even  grasp  the understanding of God's love for us is hard enough...let alone explain it!  As Tozer put it, its probably a lot like a child trying to reach a star.  Its impossible.   However,  that child can reach for that star and thus turn our heads upward....just as we can focus on and even reach for Christ, which will cause some to gaze upward to our Hope...our Love...our Life.  Another thing, if that child stays devoted to the gazing at of stars and has the passion to learn all he can about those very stars...he'll eventually get a telescope.  Next he may buy a few beginner's books.  Perhaps even take a few classes in high school.  If the child continues with his love for the stars, he'll go to college to learn astronomy where he finds out all there is to know about the stars of the heavens.  His next step could find him among those stars as an astronaut.    The same goes for us!  Right now, we can only point to the source of the Love without really being able to fully understand, explain, or even appreciate it.  But just as the child with the stars, if we continue to feed our passion for that love of Christ we'll perhaps study it more...open the Word more...and do all we can to find ourselves right in the middle of His love!  The apostle Paul does a good job of trying to explain the unfathomable love in   1 Corinthians 13.    Read it.  You'll see he straight up will define it.  He says love is  patient, kind, polite, protecting, trusting, hoping, persevering.   But then in  verses 9-12  he reminds us that we'll really not be able to grasp it completely.  He wonderfully writes in v. 12,   Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face.  Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.    So let me encourage you, as you look into that murky glass to catch a glimpse of Love:  Keep it up!  Because soon we'll find ourselves like that child who found himself among those very stars that he could simply point to years before.  We'll find ourselves  face to face  with that Love...with Christ!  Gazing myself...                 ",0

"314","686878","Sports-Recreation","        REVAMPED - (mostly the last couple segments)   the anti-americanism in france occassionally has me absolutely livid.  there's really nothing i can do about it except be the asskicking-est goddamn lecteur these frenchies have ever seen, but it bugs me nonetheless.  that probably at least partially explains why i put back a perfectly good book so i would have enough money to purchase the bright read 'Captain America' t-shirt - might as well flaunt the fact that i'm from the US after doing my best to win them over.  'hey, he's not a bad guy and he's from the US!  they can't  all  suck...'  still, there's very little you can do here.  even when they like you, sometimes that crumbles away to nothing once they find out you're from the states.  my friend jennifer was at a bar talking with some guy.  they were chatting and getting along fairly well and eventually he asked where she was from - - - - and the amiable look and friendly demeanor melted away into this vicious snarl 'i  HATE  americans!!!' and he promptly refused to have anything to do with her.  i guess that alone wouldn't bug me overmuch - i mean, there are plenty of times the US pisses me off too - but to hold every single american accountable for the actions of a small portion (government, tourists, etc)?  that's just blatant prejudice.  you're view of someone shouldn't suddenly spin 180ï¿½ solely on an accident of birth.  what's worse is the gigantic hypocrisy of the sentiments.  all right, i'm perfectly willing to accept that the US is pretty darn hypocritical too when it comes to telling other countries stuff like 'oh you can't burn the rainforest down; it's precious!  the very thought of all that forest burning makes tears come to my eyes as i sit here in my nice plush Gas Guzzler 5000.'  but it's really fucking annoying when american music, TV, books, and movies are so eagerly sought after here while the culture that produced them is vilified.  AND it's not even like they understand the US...  actually, it makes me think of Mr. Griswold's description of the anti-masons.  'what are you?' ï¿½we're anti-masons.ï¿½  'what do the masons want?'  ï¿½we don't know - but we're against them!ï¿½   for instance, they have a sandwich in the local cafeteria called an 'american'.  why?  because it has mayonnaise.  it's like they think we inject it in our veins or something.  'american pizza' is so strange i can't even describe it.  burgers come with 'american sauce' which is some kind of bizzare blend of ketchup, mustard, relish, mayonnaise, and coca cola.  okay, so i made the coca cola thing up, but the sauce is unlike anything i've ever encountered previously.  it goes beyond that too.  people (and not just french people) are under the impression that everyone in the US has a gun - almost as though we're issued them at birth.  i don't think i KNOW anyone who owns a gun (excluding police officers, of course).  maybe someone i know does have one and i just don't know about it.  in fact, it's probably likely - but nowhere  near  everyone.  or the flag?  riiiight - there's some kind of 'children of the corn' impression they have about our flag; that we have some kind of cultish reverence for it.  first off, yes it IS a symbol and the government tries to promote it as such - but it's not like i go around saluting every american flag i see.  in fact, i doubt i've done the pledge of allegiance since 8th grade.  even before that, do you think the pledge  means  anything to a child?  it's not as though 99% of them understand what they're saying.  it's more like 'hey, after i say this they let me sit down again.'  however, i also admit that the american flag is much more prominent with this new wave of patriotism.  and yet, the only place i can recall seeing the flag on a t-shirt is here in france...on french people.  in regards to another relatively recent phenomenom, one of my friends was talking about people flying american flags from their cars/trucks and said something about 'driving along with pointy white sheets over their heads' and that 'the Klu Klux Klan is very patriotic.'  i don't think he believed me when i said they were one of the most reviled groups in the country.  and perhaps they ARE patriotic...but to what nation?  i always viewed them as having secessionist views given their allegiance to the confederacy.  sure, the flag's important to them, but it's the stars and  bars  flag.  and aren't patriots supposed to uphold and safeguard the ideals of their nation?  it's really sad to find out that other countries think the US has the same ideals as the KKK.  i think i'll stop my little cathartic rant here.  see you tomorrow.  same bat-time.  same bat-channel.

"320","670684","Student","       Looking for one-hit wonders?   urlLink This site  has probably the best archive of folks who only charted one song in the synthesized decadance of the 1980s.  Granted, a lot of these bands were cult favorites (Devo, Soft Cell), while others were side projects (Frida was from Abba, Joey Scarborough was a jingle singer who got lucky with The Greatest American Hero), and some of the names included are preposterous (Peter Schilling with only one hit?!  The Mary Jane Girls in the same way?!) but the collection of names that are so forgettable is amazing!  I mean, who remembers Rocky Burnette and  To'ing The Line ?  Or even Hayzee Fantazee?  Incredible!  More on my favorite music decade...I was at a Sam Goody on Wednesday with Brian when I saw  urlLink this  album.  I can understand U2, The Moody Blues, George Clinton & Parliament, hell, even Tony Orlando all on the Columbia Essentials label, but Twisted Sister?!  I hate to comment on items bombarded by the national media, but this Great White disaster in Rhode Island begets a question.  You're Great White, an 80s hair band that tours in small clubs.  Small clubs.  You get booked in the equivalent of a wooden barn that has maybe a 15 foot ceiling at the most, and you're on a stage 2 or 3 feet high.  Yet you set up Flash Pots that shoot flames 20 feet in the air?!  If I'm paying to go see Great White in concert, I don't give a shit about flash pots...there's got to be something else that is driving me to that concert.             ",0
"321","665500","indUnk","            Lately I've Been...     Listening to:  I moved my tapes out of my office on Tuesday afternoon, after I found out I was losing my job, so I haven't been listening to too much music this week. I did play the new Los Lobos CD I bought ('The Ride') and I had some tapes and CDs on in my room while I cleaned: Buddy Holly, Jefferson Starship, Eric Clapton, and the Smashing Pumpkins. Unfortunately, the Smashing Pumpkins tape got eaten... dammit.   Watching on TV:  Saturday: 'Saturday Night Live'; Sunday: 'The Sopranos'; Monday: 'Fear Factor'; all week long: 'The Simpsons', 'Everybody Loves Raymond', and 'Seinfeld'. I watched the old 'The Match Game' a few times this week too.   Right now, I'm half-watching the new version of 'The In-Laws' but it's not very good.    Downloading:  I downloaded a few songs last night, just stuff for the band. Oh, I downloaded Eddie Izzard's 'Circle' during the week as well. I tried listening to it last night, but I was only half-paying attention to it. I need to buy the DVD.     Reading:  Still nothing.     Jamming:  I had band practice Thursday, and we practice again this Thursday. Hopefully, we'll start working on a bunch of new songs, getting ready for the next gig (a new place, we're trying to get it set up for the 29th).    Working:  Hmmm... I think I worked about 31 hours this week. I believe I will get paid 8 hours for Friday, when I stayed home. I guess I'll find out on soon enough. I have three work days left and then I'm unemployed again. JP said I'm supposed to get paid for Thursday and Friday of this next week, free money. I certainly can use it. Hopefully, I'll be allowed to work part-time, but I'm not counting on it.   Buying:  I an Eric Clapton cassette tape box set, 'Crossroads', on eBay, for just $4.49. Sweet! I'm getting set to bid on another of those SNL books that I bought before, when the lady falsely advertised it as the 'expanded version'. This one is definitely the 'expanded version' ( update : I snagged it for just $4.34, shipping included).   Selling:  Nothing this week. I need to start loading up my eBay store soon... gotta bring in money somehow.    Eating:  I've been eating a lot of good food for dinner, but it's mostly been bad-for-me type stuff: Sonny's ribs, sliced pork, Stavros greek salad, Popeyes fried chicken, mashed potatoes & red beans and rice, and tonight, Mom made Chicken Divan. I've also eaten nachos and cheese quesadillas from Bradford, a cheeseburger, a meatball sub, and french fries from Kelli's (downstairs from where I work), a couple Publix roast beef subs, and cereal (Honeycombs & Sugar Smacks... aka Smacks). Not exactly food for fitness.    Feeling:    Mentally, worried as hell about my finances. I don't know how I'm going to be able to make ends meet. With the addition of the new doctor bill I got in today, I'm hurting to the tune of nearly $3,000 ($1,000+ to pay off the bank loan I took out before the emergency room visit, almost $700 left on the guitar I laid away before the emergency room visit, and of course, the $1,000+ I need to cover my emergency room visit).    Physically, my feet have been really sore lately. That's one of the real reasons I stayed home on Friday, besides being tired and just plain not wanting to go in, I needed to rest my feet. Otherwise, I'm pretty much ok.    Planning:  To start all over again, again. I'm not loving life right now.            ",0
"322","665500","indUnk","            Xerox Copy Of Yesterday   Just like the day before, I stayed up too late (3am) and I got up too late (12:30pm). Unlike yesterday though, I had a  helluva  a time getting to sleep last night. I couldn't get comfortable and I felt uncomfortably warm. I finally got up at 5:30am and checked the thermostat and of course, Mom turned the fan off. I wish she'd leave the goddamned thing alone. I don't know how many times I have to tell her that I notice the temperature change and that it makes it difficult for me to sleep. Fuckin-a.   Also like yesterday, I got a of tapes in and all of the cases are filthy as hell. Some of the tapes are quite nasty too, but it looks like the majority are just fine, and four of them were still sealed. I paid $18.25 for the lot (65 tapes), which is probably a little more than I should have spent. I don't feel like listing everything, so I'll list some of the ones I'm keeping for myself:  The Cars 'Shake It Up', Steve Martin 'A Wild And Crazy Guy', Ratt 'Invasion Of Your Privacy', Richard Pryor 'Live', Dire Straits 'Brothers In Arms' & 'On Every Street',  Tom Petty 'Southern Accents', AC/DC 'Who Made Who', Bonnie Raitt 'Luck Of The Draw', George Thorogood 'Maverick', Duran Duran 'Rio', and John Cougar Mellencamp 'Whenever We Wanted'.   I worked on re-casing and organizing tapes for awhile then I did a little cleaning in the hobby room, organizing bubble envelopes and other packing materials. I need to do some major work in there. Between my cards and my tapes, I could really use the room. I may work on it tonight.   I still haven't picked up my electric guitar yet. We have practice tomorrow night and I haven't practiced one lick, literally. I've just been getting up too damn late. I normally would practice in the late morning/early afternoon, but I'm sleeping past then. By the time I am ready to play now, Mom is home and I have to keep it down... too much of a hassle, so I just put it off. Not good.   Speaking of Mom, she's taking next Monday off from work to drive me around, trying to find a job. She has a ton of vacation time to use, and if she doesn't use it, she loses it, so I asked her if she could take a day or two and take me around to put in applications at a few places. I just hope there are more jobs in next Sunday's paper than their were in last Sunday's. It's really tough around here right now. I guess it's pretty tough all over, actually. Anyway, this means I absolutely  must  get back to getting up in the mornings again. I can't have Mom take the day off and then sleep in til after Noon. I guess I'd better hit the sack before Midnight tonight.            ",0
"323","665284","Technology","       Yes, sometimes I talk to God.  In my head.  Like today.  I was inside the fx on the way to work, flanked by 3 others.  One on my right and two on my left.  My bag is on my lap, left hand holding a biggie size Coke and my right holding a paper bag that contains fries from McDonald's.  Squeezed like that and maybe looking harassed while drinking and eating fries, I sighed in relief when one on my left stopped at City Hall.  More space for me and my bag and my elbows.  I hoped that no more passenger will hail this fx and squeeze in to make us four again, but then I thought that maybe it's the driver's first drive this morning so it's a pity if he doesn't earn and I said okay fine God's will.

She was a big smoker; even when I was little I remembered her smoking.  The cigarettes led to cancer (as they always do) and hospitalization.  She stopped smoking, but she didnt get that much better.  She came to stay at our house for a while before going to a nursing home.  She eventually came back and has stayed ever since.  Her condition wavered.  If I missed anything, my parents will probably correct me.  Expect a change in this post.    Right now: She can't walk.  She hasnt been eating or drinking anything for a while.  When she does, it makes her throw up.  She's just been sleeping.  My aunt (a doctor) came over to look at her.  The verdict was that she wouldnt have very long.  Now she's in the hospital to find out what we could do.  Chances are, she'll need 24 hour help and wont be able to get out of bed.  She is going to die here.  It's what she want, it's what my parents want, and it's what I want.  I never noticed how barren this house is.         ",0

"327","664485","indUnk","        urlLink  'A lot of times I look at this page and wonder musingly if this is the last post I'm going to make. If things will just sort of fade away and people will forget that I've kept journals. I wonder to myself if the visitors will stop visiting and one day I'll come here and see old words and my thoughts will echo in the emtiness that is the web. I'll look around and see myself alone, and maybe I'll have the courage to really say a couple of things that have been on my mind.  But most of the times I come here hoping to vent. Hoping to let tired thoughts escape my weary mind and instead dribble flows from the tips of my fingers and I spray out so many syllables with not one little ounce of feeling behind it.  A lot of times I think this is simply because I spend so much time these days feeling things. Things I never thought I'd feel. Things I was both afraid of feeling and didn't think there were any nerves left to soak it all up.  I guess honestly my past has never been very guarded from anyone who's ever really paid any attention. The fact that it left any scars is the last thing anyone would be surprised to hear. The daily fairy tale is a shock, and yet is a ray of light and hope in a life I'd of been happy to give up on so many times during so many years.  I can't convey how weird it is, to wake up groggy next to a warm loving body next to me. For a heavy arm to fling itself across my chest and flesh press into my flesh and be joyous. The heaven of being able to feel the wonder of skin against skin, for that waft of morning breath to drift across my nostrils and for my body to sigh in releif and drink in the little stink happy that it's even there. Okay so even the best parts of life have stench, but to be joyful about it is something I am happy with.  The saddness is still there though. I am surrounded by love, and still the saddness clings to me like dirt that cannot be washed away at times. I remember the hard times, although now they are faded as they never have been. Remembering how hard it was growing up in a home where love was a rumor and happiness was dubious at best and assuredly fleeting.  I find myself wallowing this week. I go through the motions but it is a definite effort and I can't quite explain why. It makes me thankful of the arms that hold me though the nights and the dreams I can't quite escape. Strong loving arms, that I only hope feel the love I have for them.  In the mornings I face a stranger in the mirror. I'm not sure who this person is. She goes with me everywhere though, and it's odd to know that this is the only person a lot of people here know. My reflection gazes back at me unflinchingly, the face somewhat familiar, hard in places and soft in others. And the eyes stare back at me and occasionally I look at them as if looking at a strangers eyes and wonder what those eyes have seen. But then they peer knowingly at me and I remember. I remember all the things those strange sad eyes have seen.  Mostly though, my eyes stare back wearily. I wonder when I'll give up all these ghosts. I wonder when I'll get past the scars. I wonder when I'll be happy inside my skin. I wonder when I'll be content. I wonder if my particular slice of heaven has a time limit. And then I wonder if my heaven might someday blow away like so much dust in the wind.  Then my eyes meet my reflection and I stand taller, straighter, and I look like stone and my thoughts fall out of my head as if rehearsed. If all I have is a moment, I'm going to try to live in it. I'm going to try to stay in that moment. I'm going to suck every ounce of juice out of the moment as if I were dying of thirst in the middle of an arid desert. And if my moment does end...maybe the moment will sustain me though whatever comes next. This is what I tell myself. This is what I want to beleive to be true.  This is what I think before I drift off to sleep.'    hm..so i suppose these are only a month late but hey!   lol, in any case, drew better start getting his ass to work...if only because as retarded as this might seem, i actually missed that bullshit. heh, so yeah, here they are.:P  they're a little silly and i've put on weight (oh my god!) but oh well, shit happens eh?                                                                                                             chicken dissing bitch!  :P           ",0

Find a new place to live that cannot be called a 'troll hole' 5. Become a real lady, not just sometimes. 6. Do something kind for someone else at least once a day. 7. Do my ironing left over from the summer. 8. Keep in better touch with Mum. 9. Get rid of at least 10 pairs of shoes. 10. Buy one new pair of shoes. 11. Eat healthier. 12. I've run out.

I passed the test.  Spent the whole night on lemonade and water, and actually managed to have a reasonably good time.  Saturday night was the birthday of a friend from work.  Unfortunately, I was the only person out representing work, but I had a good night nonetheless.  Fluffy's mates got him wasted (and I say it like that because I, in sober mode, took no part in it).  I have never seen him that drunk before.  By ten o'clock, walking to the pub in the evening, the poor boy was falling all over the place.  We managed to get him into the club, but he disappeared on us about midnight, and we assumed that he had staggered off home.  I found out yesterday that he passed out in the gents, and had to be rescued/evicted by the bouncers after the club closed.  A worrying development, when I go out and stay sober: I seem to get a little sympathy drunk.  I was actually wobbling a bit myself in the club, and I got a seriously bad case of beer goggles.  Up until now, I wasn't aware that you could get drunk by association.    I'm the guy who lives in the reptile house   So I finish my NaNoWriMo effort, after two hours of writing, and I go downstairs thinking I'll get myself some supper and watch a little television before bed.  It's ten o'clock.  Downstairs all the lights have gone off and my housemate has already curled up in his basket and gone to sleep.  It's ten o'clock!  Milkmen keep later hours than this.  I am forced to negotiate the ground floor in the dark, because the light switch is way across the room.  I'm beginning to think that Gilly is cold-blooded.  Ever since the onset of winter, he's been going to bed earlier and earlier.  He's practically hibernating.  He's also complains of the cold non-stop, mostly when it's not really that cold in the house.  I feel like I should be keeping him in a warm glass tank and feeding him insects and dead mice.

"343","621265","Consulting","           Being vertically challenged has never been more fun... fashion wise. I made some amount of research (while I was working here in the office) to find some decent tips for peeps out there who are clamoring for some good advice on dressing up if you feel you're a little, err... a little low.   If you follow the items I outlined it could help in some way... and it won't hurt. :)  Just go for a simple wardrobe. This will help you avoid standing out in a crowd.  Avoid designs and patterns. These break up your outfit's vertical lines that normally make you look taller. (applicable to jackets, shirts, or a pair of pants, etc)  Vertical lines in shirts, suits, pants, and sweaters help in extending the facade of a shorter frame or body.  A uniform top and bottom will make your body look longer. (i.e. if you're wearing blue jeans, wearing a similar blue shirt will make you look taller)  Essentially, clothes need to fit perfectly. Wearing something tight or loose will emphasize your physical flaw.  Jackets and blazers should fall slightly below your buttocks and not above it.  Avoid blazers or cardigans with more than 3 buttons. Remember that these are designed for taller men and will end up making you look shorter.  Never wear your pants too high. Wear them just above your hips for maximum results.  Buy pants that are low-rise (a short distance between the crotch of your pants and the top of the waistband). Levi's has them.  Avoid any kind of puckering around the hips caused by full pockets, tight and badly designed pants especially pleated ones. They will make you look wider, hence shorter.  Your pants should break just above your shoes so your socks don't show.  V-neck t-shirts and sweaters will also make your torso look longer.  Avoid tucking baggy tops because they will make you look like an ice cube (wide and short).  So there. Thanks to websites i was able to gather the information above. I have to say that was enlightening for me to. :) This is new territory. Hope this helps someone at least.         ",0

Flashmobs are sudden gatherings of people at a predetermined location at a predetermined time, who basically do something wild and creative together, and then continue their journey. A sort of postmodern version of a Blitzkrieg. Heidi Plympton from England took the initiative - she sensed God was saying to her to do a prophetic prayer and worship tour on three 'hights': Llanelli in Wales, and Glastonbury and Salesbury in England. A small core group prayed into this and gave a 'trumpet call' in their network. Whoever felt led to come, joined in and brought whatever God told them to bring. Some fifty people showed up. It was an experiment with a refreshing freedom in the Holy Spirit in which a special prophetic-creative synergy developed. Not something to talk about, but something to experience.

"346","619960","Communications-Media","           'Surely we need theologians with humility and imagination, and poets with the discipline and intellectual integrity of scholars.'   I like the way you phrased this  :)   Those of us who are gifted as stewards of faith communities in particular need to live out of both the head and the heart. This isn't an easy thing to do...  'What is a theologian supposed to do these days?'  You know, reading these posts I recognize the ambiguity of my own calling, really.. my ambiguous relationship to myself. I tend not to trust my left brain dominance, but in my insecurity I sometimes live out of that place. I've wondered whether my own journey on the road to wholeness will empower me to greater faithfulness, or whether greater faithfulness is really rooted in stronger connections.. a more faithful community. In other words, perhaps my own completion is more bound up with a local expression of the body. Perhaps the complementarity and wholeness that is really necessary for any local church is just that.. a corporate wholeness. 'If all were an eye..'  If all were left brained or right brained, if all were head or heart.. if all were poets, or theologians.. We really do need one another, our strengths and our weaknesses, but we all tend, as john pointed out, to think 'that is the true bug' or 'this is the true bug.' Its tough for the left brained people to really value the more process intuitive, more process oriented left brained ones. But until we walk in that kind of love and mutual honoring, I wonder if there is really hope for change..  'Is it the role of the theologians to keep us rooted in the Big Story while the poets shape 'new stories in faithful missional communities'?'  Maybe .. but I suspect its the role of all us to stay rooted, and shape those stories together as we live in the life of Jesus day by day.

"349","605396","indUnk","            I was going to give a hyperlink to this story, but the Marianas Variety doesn't understand the concept of permalinks.    urlLink Marianas Variety On-Line Edition :  Prices of betel nuts have more than doubled    By Gemma Q. Casas Variety News Staff   PRICES of betel nuts in the CNMI have more than doubled due to the ban on imports from Guam and fears of a possible shortage of betel nuts after Typhoon Sudal struck Yap.  Betel nuts now sell 25 cents a piece or $1 per package of four, said Isidro Cabrera, agricultural consultant of Northern Marianas College's Cooperative Research, Extension and Education Service.  Before the ban, a piece of betel nut cost 10 cents or lower.  Cabrera said the CNMI produces approximately 4.8 million betel nuts a year. Yet it still imports about 100,000 betel nuts from Yap every month and several thousands from Guam.  But since last week, betel nuts from Guam had been banned due to the fungal infection plaguing the island's southern betel nut farms.  The ban will last until August, unless extended or rescinded.  'If Guam continues to have a declining production because of the disease that it is experiencing nowadays, it's going to be a big problem for betel nut chewers. Another big problem right now is Yap. Yap supplements the betel nut consumption of the CNMI but as you know, it was struck by a typhoon,' Cabrera told reporters.  'Unfortunately, with the big typhoon that came to Yap, I don't think we will get enough supply of betel nuts,' he added. Guam's betel nuts are said to be affected with a fungal infection called phytophthora meadii that thrives in rainy weather and can be carried by the wind.  The fungus can easily wipe out an entire plantation of betel nut trees in a short period of time, said Cabrera.  Those who violate the emergency ban face $100 to $1,000 civil fine or a criminal penalty of up to $2,000 or six months in jail or both.   Inspection   Because it is the nearest CNMI island to Guam, Rota's betel nuts will be inspected, Cabrera said.  'We have to make sure that the betel nut trees there are not infected,' he added. 'If they (are infected) at least we could do something to prevent it from spreading to other islands.'  Cabrera said the Department of Lands and Natural Resources and NMC-CREES are collaborating on this survey, which is set for the next two weeks. DLNR said should the disease spread to the CNMI, there is no method to control it other than to cut down the infected trees and burn them.  Growing betel nut trees is a thriving industry in the CNMI.  Cabrera said about 55 percent to 65 percent of the local population chew betel nuts.  'Every year, more people chew. Small kids learn it from adults. Culturally, we will never stop it,' Cabrera said.  It takes about six months to harvest fruits from a betel nut tree, Cabrera said. Thus, sellers import from Guam and Yap during the lean period to keep up with local demand.  Palau also used to export betel nuts to the CNMI but it has stopped to meet the island nation's own demand.  Although growers only harvest betel nuts twice a year, it still brings in profit. Cabrera said a piece of land with 2,000 betel nut trees can bring in an income of $50,000 to $60,000 a year.  Scientific studies show chewing betel nut could lead to diseases, especially when it is mixed with lime, pepper leaf and tobacco.  (With reports by Haidee Eugenio)           ",0

I guess I ain't the target demographic for Cartier, Rolex, Tiffany & Co. and the rest of the ritzy stores in that little mall.  Despite the tony surroundings, the Joinus Restaurant seemed a bit rundown. It was certainly dark and claustrophobic, there is not a window in the restaurant. However the restaurant packed in the patrons for one reason: a great deal on teppanyaki. People on Guam know a good deal when it involves food. The price of any one of three set teppan menus is $10.99 - the options all include sirloin steak and shrimp along with a choice of chicken, salmon or scallops. I cannot remember the last time I ate teppanyaki, easily two years or more. I like teppanyaki too, but the closure of the Kurumaya Seahorse in 2002 set me adrift. God I miss that place. I spent many an evening there, relaxing after paddling practice, enjoying Tumon's warm sands and the fading twilight over the Philippine Sea. It is a crying shame the restaurant was closed down and the building demolished, especially since the developer never built a damn thing on that lot.

I think i was trying to catch up on lost disney channel time. however, much to my chagrin, by the time disney rolled around full time, mmc and kids inc were no longer in the mix. i think that scenario is also a good metaphor for my life in its entirety thus far. anyhoo. i forced myself to watch the disney channel despite the fact that pretty much all they showed was boy meets world and smart guy reruns, two shows which i thouroughly detest. but ho, there is a light at the end of this mouse-eared tunnel. that light is disney original movies. it all started one dark and stormy night. i was sick with a cold, and parked in front of the television one friday evening. my parents were out for the night because their social life is much more full and exciting than my own, and my brother was visiting. i, of course, had the disney channel in my regular channel flipping rotation and noticed that there was some sort of movie on. that movie, was entitled 'genius'. ever see it? well, i sure hadnt. i found myself completely enraptured in the film and disappointed to no end when a commercial would sneak up on me and interrupt my viewing. this particular film, if you could call it that, was about a young buck who was, well, a genius. this genius, who was about 14 or 15 and should have been in eighth or ninth grade, was actually attending college. not only was he attending college, as part of his scholarship this young lad not only had to attend classes, he also taught a class and had to put in time as an assistant to a mad-scientist type who worked in the basement of the school on a project involving molecular fusion or something equally ridiculuous. sounds plausable so far, right? well, as would any boy in his position, he realizes that even though he has all these great things that most people can only dream of, what he truly wants is to be liked. aw. so then on top of all his other commitments, he enrolls himself in the local junior high, but dresses up as a 'cool kid' complete with shades and rollerblades. he of course becomes the hottest thing since gameboy color in the eyes of his peers, and especially the girl of his dreams, who's father coincidentally enough, coaches his college's hockey team. cut to the end of the film, the hockey team is in trouble and our little genius rigs up some sort of virtual-reality/anti-gravity device that he puts on the players' skates. not making sense? well, it doesnt i assure you. of course the team wins the championship and the genius gets the girl and the respect of his fellow students alike.   reminds me of junior high, how about you? if it sounds completely ridiculous, it should. if it sounds completely implausable, it should. if you think its completely not worth your time, youre wrong. speaking from the point of view of a girl who is terribly well versed in the way of pop culture and has seen dozens upon dozens of award winning and critically aclaimed films, disney original movies are the cream of the crop. and if genius sounds good, just think about this...its probably one of my least favorite disney originals. have i peaked your interest? are you on the edge of your seat? do you want to know more?  yeah, i didnt think so. im sorry. this is why i dont update. i apologize from the bottom of my broken heart.

Yeah, he cancels half the tests for the year and half the entire course was made up of movies, but the classes he was there and actually taught were good. I can't believe I got an 88 first term in this class. Ah well, I redeemed myself.   2. The 'ZEE MARK IZ MEIN!' Award  English is hard. I can accept that. But having a teacher think 80 is the Holy of Holies makes it slightly more difficult. Only slightly. Okay, I lie. Mitsopoulos is a nice teacher, really. It's her Mark Nazi marking schemes that make us all weep.   3. The 'One to three, a, e, g, four, a to c, and 7 to 9' Award  How Voves assigns homework: she picks her three favourite letters of the day and three favourite numbers of the day and puts it together somehow so that it comes out as a string of questions for the day's homework. Needless to say, it's preferable to the lazy teachers who just assign 1 to 263257.   4. The 'Good morning to each and everyone of you' Award  Mirkopoulos is nice. REALLY nice. And REALLY easy. Her happy-ness (that's deliberate) and hand gestures make everyone feel safe from overly difficult things. She had to make the civics exam slightly harder, and it was as easy as invading  urlLink France .   5. The 'I wish I could get to know my brother more' Award.  Beswick is a depressed guy. He's easy. He's emotional. Apparently, he broke down into tears because of a reaction from his students to one of his tests. And he's away every other class. The man has problems. It's best to leave him alone.   6. The 'My dog is better than you' Award  Hybs is amazing. Hybs is smart. Hybs will make you look stupid. Hybs will create fear in you. Hybs will then mark in such a way that you will be rejoicing. Yep. That Hybs is crazy. One of the greatest teachers, evar.   7. The 'Everything that can go wrong will' Award  Music is so fun. But alas, there is always something going wrong. There's always some amusing 'you won't believe it' type thing going on in Ms. Moroz's life. I'm glad she's our music teacher and not some other schmuck.   8. The 'I'll bump you up to 99 and just to be fair, I'll bump everyone up the amount I bump you up too' Award.  Khorshichehr is a really good teacher. He makes computer engineering easy. Even better is the fact that he bumps the highest student in the class (me!) up to 99 and does the same for everyone else too. Ah yes, I like that. My average has never been looking better.   9. The 'Useless retarded hypocrite who should have been fired a few years ago but hey the stupid teacher's union has to protect the lives of dangerous stupids so we can't do a damned thing about but at least the principal and department head agree with us' Award.  Zayit is the most incompetent retard in the entire world. If I did not need to take computer science, I would have dropped it in a heartbeat. I do not care if I'm getting 100 in that class. The waste of time and intelligence in that class has been devastating. I will be seething with hate when I hear that accursed name.

As a Tolkien purist, I have several complaints.  As a movie fan, not so many, but, lord help you if you have not read the books or sat next to someone who could explain the finer points that are glossed over.  My biggest complaint is the fact that because they expanded on the Battle of Helm's Deep greatly (1/3 of the movie revolves around it - where it was one chapter out of about 12 in the first half of the book) and that they added the romance between Aragorn and Arwen plus a skirmish between the Rohan and Warg riding Goblins, they really only got through about 2/3 of the book.  Given the amount of fighting left to be shown in Return of the King, you can see that they will cut out several parts of the story.  Because of some of the modifications already seen, it does not appear that Aragorn will take the Path of Dead and bring the naval fleet up to break the siege.  They will also probably not address what becomes of Saruman and what happens to the Shire.  The greatly enhanced roles of Merry and Pippin (with Rohan and Gondor) do not appear to be occuring either.  Who will kill the Witch King?  I also think the tried to hard to set up the sequel.  The emphasis on Gollum's discussion of 'she' in regards to getting the Ring are totally transparent to those who have read the books, but not really sold well if you have not.All said and done, I enjoyed the movie, and intend to see it again (hopefully with Mr. Haley when he is back among the living), but am disappointed with the lack of trueness compared to FotR.

"387","578626","Education","                 We're back from our trip. It was very restorative in all ways.   We started out in Minneapolis. Eric was very good on the plane. However, I don't think I'll do another flight where he doesn't have his own seat. It's just too hard. We spent the first night at my uncle's house amid their clutter. But they are very loving and open people so we felt very welcome and wanted. They live inches from one of Minnesota's 10,000 lakes and we were able to go for a spin in my uncle's boat. Rich rode on the jet ski and he fell off. My uncle's house is in a fabulous location. The back walls are almost all glass and they have an un-obstructed view of the lake. However, the walls are covered in teak wood paneling and the floors have orangey carpeting. It is straight out of the 1950's. The formal living area has some type of stone floors, but they look like linoleum because of the flecked pattern on them.  the following morning we headed up to Laporte Minnesota about 200 miles northwestish. Once again Eric was a trooper for most of the trip. We stopped for lunch at a diner about an hour South of my aunt's house. He ate cheerios and I ate some very tasty strawberry pie with extra coolwhip. YUM!! We got to my aunt's house around 3, and my father's oldest sister was there as well. She was with her daughter Jennifer (who is 5 months pregnant) and her husband. Everybody was so good to Eric. My aunt Donna (Dad's youngest sister) had two miniature horses. They were SO cute.   We spent a lovely relaxing week there. We stayed at a cabin about a mile from my aunt's house. I got a pedicure at a salon in Walker, Minnesota called 'The Razor's Edge.' It was one of the nicest pedicures ever. The woman really took her time and said it was her favorite thing to do. She was five months pregnant and still working hard. I didn't realize until later that she was. I hope those chemicals they use for nails don't hurt her baby.  Eric was a superstar. He crabbed for his sleep in the middle of some fun moments and we had to leave. But my GOD he's a good baby.  After our week at the  urlLink Cry of the Loon Lodge  we headed back down to Minneapolis. We got to visit with the Kemper family. My friend Emily Schwartz now Kemper happened to be in Minneapolis from Houston at the same time we were there. The big news is that Eric had is first kiss with Emily's daughter Fronia. It was very cute. At two, she knows how to give a hug and a kiss, and she did and a lightbulb flashed above Eric's head and he grabbed her back and touched her cheek with his lips. Of course we had put all the cameras away by then. But it was still fun.  There's some huge news coming here next week. But I don't want to post it in case it falls into the wrong eyes...               ",0

"391","576311","indUnk","       Was just listening to some of the metallica i have.  I had their stuff on vinyl once upon a time.. all Metalblade releases.    Master of Puppets is probably my favorite Metallica album.  It seemed on the verge of doing something fantastic.  I've always thought this was Metallica at their best.  ... And Justice for All was good, but it was missing something that MoP had. (Cliff Burton, perhaps...)   The two albums prior to MoP were also great, but the production on them was weird.  They sounded like they were recorded in a big, tiled bathroom.    ( aside : When i worked at the car wash in town detailing cars, i'd usually have my bass or an acoustic with me.  On my breaks i'd sit and jam in the bathroom, which had superb acoustics for an acoustic guitar).    Among bass players, especially the ones who primarily focus on metal, the debate rages: Burton vs. Newstead: Who's Better?  Well, Cliff is dead, so obviously we can only imagine how much further he might have come with his playing.  Some people regard 'Anesthesia (Pulling Teeth)' as   The Best Bass Solo Ever, In The Universe. Period.   I think at the time it came out it was pretty special.  It's fun, and kind of hard to play.  I know if we're playing somewhere and i goof off with some of the lines in that, there will be a small knot of 30-something dudes gathered around to watch.   always .  If i stop, they're devastated.  Newstead is a different player.  Not better or worse.  His lines, usually buried deep in the mix, are not especially complicated, but the simplicity is what gives them their power.  It's a phrasing thing, making the music breathe.  Y'know, instead of doing notes to fill between kicks, you lay down a note on each kick, or in between them, or something.  That's Newstead's style, where Burton's was to fill up the spaces.  Newstead used 'the spaces in between'.  (Tam asked what was important in bass playing once, and all i could think of was 'the spaces in between')  So, really, you can't compare to the two guys.  One's dead and the other guy plays differently.    Newstead's stuff with Echobrain was pretty cool.  He sounded comfortable.  He sounded like he was really digging what he was doing, and i'm really interested to hear what he brings to Ozzy's band.  As well, i'm interested to hear Rob Castillo in Metallica.  From the Funk of ST to the grind of Metallica... neat.    .      ",0

Barbecue used to be a regional delicacy, a Southern thang. Now it belongs to all of America and you can find really good 'cue just about anywhere. Even Gaithersburg.  Same's true with what used to be called Southern literature.  It's good and it's nationwide.  Take Lee Smith's new novel, 'The Last Girls,' published by Chapel Hill-based Algonquin Books in September. It has all the trappings -- a clutch of alumnae of a fictitious Blue Ridge Mountain women's college, a trip on a riverboat down the Mississippi, a dead woman named Baby.  There was a time when everyone would have hailed the book as a fine Southern yarn.  That time is gone.  The New York Times, the Miami Herald and the Boston Globe all reviewed Smith's work -- favorably -- without once calling it a Southern novel.  Sure enough, as you read it you realize that these women -- with their lost opportunities and retrofitted dreams -- could have come from anywhere, and you begin to wonder if there even is such a thing as Southern literature anymore.  The question comes up at lunchtime as Smith meets a few of her friends -- Louis D. Rubin Jr., Shannon Ravenel, Fred Hobson and Lucinda MacKethan -- at Allen & Son.  Rubin is the founding editor of Algonquin and spiritual godfather to many writers.  Hobson is a humanities professor at the University of North Carolina and MacKethan teaches English at North Carolina State. They, like Smith, were students of Rubin when he taught at what is now Hollins University in Virginia. This group knows the South, and literature.  Ravenel, who helped Rubin launch Algonquin, asks him if he has seen a certain new book of Southern photographs. He says he has. 'I almost threw up,' he says.  The problem, he says, is that it's a trumped-up book written for tourists. He makes it sound like the literary equivalent of tourist traps, such as Gatorland or snake farms.  Rubin, 79, who edited the 1985 landmark work 'The History of Southern Literature,' wears a short-sleeve plaid shirt. For lunch he has a slice of peanut butter pie and a cup of coffee. He has hearing aids in both ears.   When it comes to talking literature, he's as sharp as ever.  Hobson points out the ever-increasingly multicultural complexion of the South. 'There's been an influx of Caribbean and Mexican and Asian voices,' he says. 'It's not just a black and white thing anymore.'  Rubin says the region has changed so dramatically in recent years, it has lost its sense of a shared history. That past was treated as myth. 'I don't know that the myth is still important,' he says.  'The past is not as important,' MacKethan says.  Smith adds, 'The past is not as agreed upon.'   Maybe the past is, at last, past.  Folks used to agree on a lot. That there was such a thing as Southern literature, for instance.  William Faulkner. Eudora Welty. Richard Wright. Tennessee Williams. Thomas Wolfe. Truman Capote. Carson McCullers. Reynolds Price. Zora Neale Hurston. Katherine Anne Porter. Robert Penn Warren. James Dickey. Flannery O'Connor. Willie Morris.   Those dogs could hunt.  Granted, they wrote in different styles and with varying degrees of success. But there was still something there. Something solid and familiar and identifiable.  Something Southern.  For one thing, there was a common theme playing through most of the stories: the Defeated South.  Around the time Walker Percy accepted the National Book Award for his 1962 novel 'The Moviegoer,' he was asked what made the South different from the rest of the country.  We lost, he said.  Percy was perhaps the transitional Southern writer -- with one foot in the traditional South and another in the post-traditional South. 'The Moviegoer' was as indebted to the European existentialist literature as it was to Faulkner.  For another, there was a graceful prose style -- in the fiction and the nonfiction -- a gentility reflected in the culture.  As the South has been swallowed up by America, all that has changed. The region has lost some of its manners and moorings. Irate drivers honk at each other in Jackson. You can buy the New York Times in Mobile. There's sushi everywhere. Faux moonshine, Mason jar and all, is sold -- and taxed -- in liquor stores.  John Shelton Reed, former director of UNC's Center for the Study of the American South in Chapel Hill, says, 'You're right about there not being a central theme anymore.'  How did this come to be?   In the beginning, American and Southern literature were one. J.A. Leo Lemay wrote that 'American, and Southern, literature began when Sir Walter Raleigh sent four major expeditions to Virginia.' The first was in 1584, led by Arthur Barlow. As the exploring party neared land, Barlow wrote, the air was alive with a sweet fragrance, 'so strong a smell, as if we had been in the midst of some delicate garden, abounding with all kinds of odoriferous flower.'  From the get-go, Southern literature was flowery.  Others believe that Capt. John Smith, who wrote his 'True Relation of Occurrences and Accidents in Virginia' in 1608, got the ball rolling.   But a definably Southern literature did not emerge until after the Civil War, a mythmaking confrontation in the minds of many Americans.  The first Southern literature was, in the words of critics, local color.  Characterized by quirky characters and rampant vernacular, works of local colorists were extremely popular throughout the South between 1865 and 1910.  Writers such as George Washington Cable and Thomas Nelson Page groped about for a regional voice. Using already-weary cultural cliches and lots of down-home di'lec, these men and other three-name wonders including Ruth McEnery Stuart, John Esten Cooke and Joel Chandler Harris spewed out stories about Southerners' peculiar ways of living and thinking and speaking.  The tales were lapped up like collard greens by readers across America, and implanted many Southern stereotypes in the popular mind. With the exception of Harris and his tales of Uncle Remus, these local colorists and their works are largely forgotten.  Then along came Faulkner and others, and between 1925 and 1985 the South produced some of the greatest literature in history.  By Faulkner: 'The Sound and the Fury' in 1929, 'Light in August' and novellas including 'The Bear' in 1932, 'Absalom, Absalom' in 1936, 'Collected Stories' in 1950 and 'The Reivers' in 1962, a body of work that won him the Nobel Prize.  By Eudora Welty: 'A Curtain of Green' in 1941, 'Delta Wedding' in 1946, 'Losing Battles' in 1970 and her autobiographical 'One Writer's Beginnings' in 1984.  By Richard Wright: 'Native Son' in 1940 and the memoir 'Black Boy' in 1945.  By Tennessee Williams: 'The Glass Menagerie,' first produced in 1944, 'A Streetcar Named Desire' in 1947 and 'Cat on a Hot Tin Roof' in 1955.  Literary movements -- such as the Fugitives and the Agrarians -- flourished in the South. It all happened in such a short span of time.  Thomas Wolfe died in 1938. ('You Can't Go Home Again' was published in 1940.) Zora Neale Hurston published 'Dust Tracks on a Road' in 1942, and died in 1960. James Dickey's 'Deliverance' was published in 1970. He produced little prose of much significance after that.  By the mid-'70s, the great run of Southern literature was coming to an end.  In 1974, John Egerton wrote 'The Americanization of Dixie: The Southernization of America.' His thesis: Because of mass media and rapid transit and the immense changes brought about by the civil rights movement, the once segregated and separated South was being thrown into the blender with the rest of the nation. Southern literature was part of the new cultural margarita.  Impatient with being asked the same old questions, Walker Percy interviewed himself in Esquire in 1977:  Q. You're not interested in the South?   A. I'm sick and tired of talking about the South and hearing about the South.   Q. Do you regard yourself as a southern writer?   A. That is a strange question, even a little mad. Sometimes I think that the South brings out the latent madness in people. It even makes me feel nutty to hear such a question.   Q. What's mad about such a question?   A. Would you ask John Cheever if he regarded himself as a northeastern writer?   Q. What do you think of southern writers?   A. I'm fed up with the subject of southern writing. Northern writing, too, for that matter.   Apparently Percy was not just speaking for himself. Since 1985, most books written by Southerners and/or set in the South can be boiled down to: American stories with a Southern accent, such as Smith's, and the local-color variety, such as Anne Rivers Siddons and anything by Fannie Flagg.  Here's an excerpt from a chapter called 'Uncle Floyd Has a Fit' in Flagg's new novel, 'Standing in the Rainbow': 'Two days after Christmas,' she writes, 'the phone rang. Betty Raye, walking by, picked up and to her surprise it was her mother. Minnie Oatman was on the other end, calling long-distance from the office of the Talladega, Alabama, Primitive Baptist Church and she was hysterical.  ' 'Oh, Betty Raye, honey, something terrible has happened, brace yourself for bad news.'  ' 'Momma, what is it?'  ' 'Honey,' Minnie sobbed, 'we lost Chester last night. Chester's gone and your Uncle Floyd is locked hisself in the men's room, blaspheming the Lord, and he won't come out.'  ' 'What men's room?' said Betty Raye.  ' 'Over at the seafood place. One minute we was happy without a care in the world eating fried shrimp and the next thing we knowed Floyd was running around the parking lot, screaming like a banshee. In the time it took to eat twelve fried shrimp Chester had been snatched right out of his little suitcase in broad daylight and was gonded . . . kidnapped just like the Lindberger baby.' '  Chester, as it happens, is a Scripture-quoting ventriloquist's dummy.  There is really no such thing as contemporary Southern literature.  'It's like we're back to local-color writing,' says Bryan Bremen of the University of Texas. He says some contemporary Southern fiction is 'rooted in almost a kind of cartoon version of what we think of as New Orleans, or what we think of as Georgia.'  Bremen says that this is the case because 'geographic boundaries have certainly become more fluid.'  Hal Crowther, Lee Smith's husband and a columnist for a Chapel Hill newspaper, has given a lot of thought to Southern literature.  It is often defined, he says, by 'the morons in New York who think that everybody has an outhouse. You cannot exaggerate the ignorance of some New York editors.'  He admits, 'There are people down here writing who play right into the hands of editors.'  But the traditional idea of a work being distinctly Southern is no more.  'We have to radically change our idea of what is Southern,' Crowther says.  Every year Shannon Ravenel edits a collection called 'New Stories From the South.' To make her selections, she pores over more than 100 different magazines and some 200-300 stories with Southern settings.  This year's anthology contains tales by writers living in Italy, New York City, Denver, Iowa City, Madison, Wis., and other far-flung places.  'I no longer say 'Southern writers,' ' Ravenel says.  We've come full circle.   As it was in the beginning, Southern literature nowadays is American literature. And, on occasion, vice versa. Something is gained by the passing of a 'Southern literature': Most books by and about Southerners are no longer treated as curiosities. They are judged as American works.  And something is lost: For a while there, books by and about Southerners explored -- and expressed -- the deepest extremes of the human heart and soul. Like other canons of great literature -- Irish, Russian -- Southern literature changed the way we look at the world.  There are older writers -- Smith, Ernest J. Gaines, Pat Conroy -- who continue to write powerful American novels that happen to be Southern.  Mississippian Donna Tartt, riding a tidal wave of publicity around her second novel, 'The Little Friend,' doesn't want to be called a Southern writer. 'It's not pleasant to be lumped into a group of black writers or women writers or gay writers,' she told USA Today. 'Why be part of a group simply because of the circumstances of your birth?'  And there are younger voices, such as Silas House, Tony Earley and Tayari Jones, who at one time might have been called Southern but now are not so easily pigeonholed.  Walking her dog around Hillsborough, Lee Smith is not quite ready to give up on the idea of Southern lit. 'It's more oral,' she says, 'more speakerly than writerly.'  Southern prose 'comes from the conversational' and 'avoids abstraction,' she says.  'In the South, people just talk all the damn time,' she says. 'Every kind of information is presented as narrative.'  But, she adds, it just might be 'more a difference between urban and rural.'  She stands in the crisp daylight and speaks of the swift-changing South. Even her little town is going through a metamorphosis.   She points to a line of stores. 'There's a new espresso shop,' she says, 'right next to a live-bait store.'    2002 The Washington Post Company         ",0
"394","554681","indUnk","       Adam Haslett  A stranger no more  Adam Haslett balances law school with explosive literary success  David Wiegand, Chronicle Staff Writer Saturday, September 21, 2002  2002 San Francisco Chronicle.   URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2002/09/21/DD222445.DTL&type=books       There probably aren't too many Elis running around New Haven these days who think of Yale Law School as a kind of career halfway house, but that's what Adam Haslett is doing in his final year of classes there. For three days of the week, he's focusing on criminal and appellate law at Yale. The rest of his time is spent back in his New York apartment, working on his first novel and, in essence, preparing for next year, when he will devote full time to an out-of-nowhere literary career that's made him one of the most talked about young writers of the year.   Tall and lanky, with a retreating hairline over a wide forehead, brown eyes and a sharply angular nose, Haslett, 31, is still a bit stunned at the reception his debut book of stories, 'You Are Not a Stranger Here' (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday), has received since its publication this summer. Not only has the book drawn critical raves, it was also recently chosen by author Jonathan Franzen ('The Corrections') as the second selection in the NBC 'Today' show's fledgling on-air book club. So far, there are 100,000 copies in print, a fairly amazing number for a first book of stories by a virtual unknown.   The nine stories in the book represent an unusual breadth of human experience, much of it at least initially disturbing: A man travels to England with his wife with the idea of committing suicide and meets an old woman who   is tending to a dying youth in a room that reeks of the ointment she spreads on the boy's ravaged body to ease his pain; a psychiatrist believes that he can help a woman whose now-dead son severed the fingers of one of her hands during a crystal meth binge; a teenage boy invites repeated physical and sexual brutalization by a school bully in order to unleash his repressed grief over his mother's suicide.   While some might simplistically call the stories sad or depressing, Haslett isn't defensive when he disagrees.   'I don't find them sad at all because for me the saddest thing is compulsory happiness, the notion that a happy ending is something we have to have,' he says, sitting in the window seat of a Noe Valley Starbucks earlier this week. 'I don't think stories have to have happy endings in order to be stories that contain a kind of redemptive quality.'   While Haslett's stories may not fit the Aristotelian definition of comedy, their characters all undergo some kind of transformation, usually through contact with others who, often unwittingly, enable a kind of benedictive catharsis. The teenage boy is finally able to grieve; the suicidal man, whose wife is constantly afraid of leaving him alone for fear of what he'll do, finds solace in the company of the dying boy whose time is also growing short; the shrink reaches a new understanding of his own pain once he accepts the lonely mother's resolve to live with the loss of her son because it is now and forever a part of who she is.   'Depression is really like a total lack of emotion in a way, and I feel that if anything it's the opposite of depression or numbness that is the definition of true sadness,' he says. 'These people are flooded with feeling.'   Haslett, the youngest of three children, was born in Kingston, Mass., to a businessman and a schoolteacher. His brother is a music journalist living in Cambridge, Mass., and his sister, with whom he stayed during his Bay Area book tour, is a documentary filmmaker at Stanford. During the equivalent of his junior high years, Haslett and his family lived in England, where his father was born.   'I was just a kid, then,' he says. 'At first I didn't want to go, and once I got there, I didn't want to leave. I did the whole British prep school thing,   with the shorts and the tie.'   He still returns to the Scottish Highlands, where his stepfather lives, and several of his stories are convincingly set in England.   Haslett began writing fiction as an undergraduate at Swarthmore College, where he happened to take one seminar with Franzen. After college, he found himself trying to choose between writing and what he calls 'a reliable life' in a solid profession, such as law. He was able to defer Yale while he studied at the Iowa Writers and the Provincetown Fine Arts Workshops. Today, he says, 'it's still an open question' as to whether he'll ever practice law, now that he's making a name for himself as a writer.   Following its English sojourn, Haslett's family returned to upscale Wellesley, Mass., where his widowed mother still lives.   And now her handsome, single, gay son is the literary toast of the town and finishing his law studies at Yale. On the surface, Haslett's is an enviable life. One might even go so far as saying his has been a life of privilege and opportunity.   But a suggestion of something else begins, haltingly, to emerge when he is asked about his late father, who suffered from manic depression.   'It definitely impacted the family. It was a formative experience,' he says,   adding that 'there were times when he got to a point where he couldn't work.'   He struggles for the right words for a second, admitting that he's never really talked much about his father's illness before.   'He was in psychiatric care. He wasn't necessarily always wanting to be in the care.'   Although mental illness figures in some of Haslett's work, 'there's nothing really literal [from his past] in the stories.'   'I feel more liberated as a writer when I find things that are 45 degrees off to the side [of his own life], so that some of my experiences flow into them and shape them.   'I feel lucky to be able to write. It's the only thing I've ever done that sort of integrates the past with what happens in the present, and what could happen in the future. There aren't many activities in life that can do all of those things, and writing is one of them. So when it goes well it feels like a privilege.'   If so, it's a privilege Adam Haslett has clearly earned.   E-mail David Wiegand at dwiegand@sfchronicle.com.   2002 San Francisco Chronicl          ",0

On 9/11, I remember that I pleaded with God that Bush and the rest of our nation's leaders would treat the situation with integrity and forgiveness.  Now, all I see is preemptive wars and a McCarthy-esque hunt for terrorists; it just seems like Bush's administration has only fed the reasonings of its detractors, of all the terrorist groups.  What actions could our nation's leaders possibly take in order to prove all of these people wrong?  A deeper fear for me lies in the possibility that our current situation points to darker times ahead.  It doesn't seem like the situations in the Middle East are improving.

Isaiah 61:10-11  I studied this passage during a study break last Wednesday, and it blew me away.

With the soil and sprout analogy, I conjured up this image in my head of the roots anchored in the ground, and the water and nutrients seeping into them.  Just as the soil feeds and infuses life into the sprouts, so does God infuse us with His ingredients of life.  Then righteousness and praise may become characteristics of us, His redeemed.

"400","546236","Law","           Boston Globe-- urlLink Veteran retracts criticism of Kerry .    But yesterday, a key figure in the anti-Kerry campaign, Kerry's former commanding officer, backed off one of the key contentions. Lieutenant Commander George Elliott said in an interview that he had made a ''terrible mistake' in signing an affidavit that suggests Kerry did not deserve the Silver Star -- one of the main allegations in the book. The affidavit was given to The Boston Globe by the anti-Kerry group to justify assertions in their ad and book.  ***  Yesterday, reached at his home, Elliott said he regretted signing the affidavit and said he still thinks Kerry deserved the Silver Star.  ''I still don't think he shot the guy in the back,' Elliott said. ''It was a terrible mistake probably for me to sign the affidavit with those words. I'm the one in trouble here.'  Elliott said he was no under personal or political pressure to sign the statement, but he did feel ''time pressure' from those involved in the book. ''That's no excuse,' Elliott said. ''I knew it was wrong . . . In a hurry I signed it and faxed it back. That was a mistake.'  That isn't the end of the story since Elliott later in the article says:     Elliott, in the interview yesterday, said that based on the affidavits of the veterans on other boats, he now thinks his [positive] assessment about the Bronze Star and third Purple Heart may have been based on poor information.  ***  But he said: ''I simply have no reason for these guys to be lying, and if they are lying in concert, it is one hell of a conspiracy. So, on the basis of all of the information that has come out, I have chosen to believe the other men. I absolutely do not know first hand.'  Couple thoughts:  the retraction of the Silver Star charge is obviously not helpful to the Swiftees--but while Elliott may reconsider his opinion--as yet none of the others have.  And that is, to a large extent, what this debate is--a difference of opinion re: the 'quality' of Kerry's record.  In Elliott's mind, Kerry's conduct warranted a Silver Star--in the Swiftees' view, it did not.   Now, combine that with the fact that Elliott still harbors doubts about Kerry's Bronze Star and third Purple Heart and it's not clear that this will seriously undercut the Swiftees.  But as I said, it certainly doesn't HELP.  But of course, a lot of this is dependent upon what the book says--if the book has additional evidence regarding the Silver Star; then that could mitigate.  If not, it won't.     UPDATE :  Via  urlLink Drudge  comes this press release from the Swiftees  urlLink saying Elliott stands by his earlier claims :   The following statement from Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is in response to an article appearing in the morning edition of the Boston Globe (â€œVeteran Retracts Criticism of Kerryâ€) which implies that one Vietnam Veteran wishes to retract an affidavit he signed regarding John Kerryâ€™s actions during and after Kerryâ€™s time in Vietnam. The signed affidavit can be seen below.   'Captain George Elliott describes an article appearing in todayâ€™s edition of the Boston Globe by Mike Kranish as extremely inaccurate and highly misstating his actual views. He reaffirms his statement in the current advertisement paid for by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, Captain Elliott reaffirms his affidavit [see below] in support of that advertisement, and he reaffirms his request that the ad be played.   Doesn't look like this is over yet.   UPDATE 2 :   urlLink Human Events Online  has a second affidavit, dated today and signed by George Elliott, it reads:   'Had I known the facts, I would not have recommended Kerry for the Silver Star for simply pursuing and dispatching a single, wounded, fleeing Viet Cong'  Well, ok then.

"401","535158","Law","         ECONOMISTS ON THE TAX CUT  I didn't analyze the tax-cut-as-stimulus idea the same way the economists did, but it seems  urlLink I did catch the major logical flaw  in President Bush's argument, which ended up in the  urlLink Washington Post : Some members of Congress support tax relief but say my proposal is too big,' Bush said in his Saturday radio address. 'Since they already agree that tax relief creates jobs, it doesn't make sense to provide less tax relief and, therefore, create fewer jobs.'   But few economists would argue that tax policy is so straightforward. Taken to its extreme, Joel Slemrod  [pictured above] , a tax economist at the University of Michigan, said that Bush's argument would support eliminating taxes altogether for the sake of job creation.   'Logically, the statement that more tax cuts are better is certainly wrong,' Slemrod said. The economics seem to indicate that the economic state of the country is not just a question of how much money is put into the economy, because over the course of the Bush Administration losses have been exceeded by recent tax cuts and huge spending.  In the long run (say, 4 years from now),  urlLink the article  also said, the Bush Administration tax cuts would raise interest rates and lower savings rates and, due to higher return for investment income, there would be less jobs created.

"402","535158","Law","        BIG PLANS  I'm planning a big trip and I don't know if I'm even going to be able to do it.    Ah, the things you do with your time when you have nothing to do.  I spent a significant part of the day yesterday reading trail reports and planning a trip to the Skyline Trail, a big, wild traverse above the Quinault River in the Olympic Mountains of Washington.  This is the one that got away, the hiking equivalent of that gigantic bass the guy at the diner is always talking about in movies.  I've hiked all over the Olympics, and this is the one place I really want to go.  And I don't even have enough money to buy a ticket home right now.    So I called up my brother, woke him up, asked him when he'd be able to go.  He said after the 23 rd .  'Great,' I said, 'Oh, and Happy Birthday.'  I let him go back to sleep.  I called my Dad, got his work answer machine.  Said I'd call tonight. [Never actually called]  I read the trail reports.  They all said there were tons of bugs, the way was impossible to follow after the first few cairns, there's tons of snow, ice axes are necessary in places, the trail goes up and down and up and down again, you have to wade a river, and the approach has lots of blown-down trees.  Sounds great.  Then I looked up some flights on the Internet.  Beeee-ooh-wee-oooh.  The internet's up.  I open up four windows: travelocity, cheap tickets, expedia, orbitz.  After looking at a couple flights on each of these sites I soon have twenty windows open and I'm stretching my computer's memory to its limits - you know, the point at which fonts don't work right any more and you can't click between sites easily?  I find a great flight.  $305, National to Sea-Tac.  I look for dates on the calendar-thingie the site's got.  No flights on my dates, or the next three, or the previous three, and so it goes, until about two hours later I realize I can get flights for $320-$340 at about the end of August until the beginning of September, which is about ideal - there'll be enough time for the snow to all melt that'll melt, I think.  Then I think my Mom will want to see me.  So I guess I better lengthen the trip.  I then realize I've been on the couch all morning in my bathrobe and it's 1pm.  I peeled myself off the couch like a piece of velcro and showered.  I even went the extra mile to shave so as to feel like a proper human being.  I went down to take care of an insurance thing and bought some stuff at Safeway.  Salsa material.  I came home and made the salsa.  Rudimentary stuff, I just sort of guessed what'd go in there - roma tomatoes chopped up about the right size, most of an onion, a bunch of cilantro.  I cut up a lime in eighths and squeezed the juice into the mix.  It tasted all right, but I didn't eat it.  I had decided to go running.  One of the trail reports about the Skyline Trail emphasized that 'You cannot be in good enough shape.'  I've been running for a few months now and have lost a good 15-20 pounds.  I like it somewhat; the running definitely gives me more energy and a sense of accomplishment, which is always good to have.  But I realized I'm going to have to pick up the running to get in good enough shape to survive the Skyline Trail.  Plus every bit of weight I drop is weight I won't have to carry up a mountain.  So I took this crazy route up north in a drizzle, running up to Van Ness street on the trails and then cutting over to a trail I'd never taken before, along Melvin Hazen creek - you're basically running alongside this stream that goes down a ravine, and then suddenly there's Connecticut Avenue.  The trail got even steeper on the other side, but it was nice scenery.   By this time I'm sweating like crazy and my shirt weighs 100 pounds from the sweat and the drizzle.  I tried to squeeze it out, but there was no way to fix the problem.  But I'm not taking off the shirt until I have the washboard abs.  So basically never.  So I ran down the hill to where the trail came up alongside Rock Creek and then I ran on the hill on the side of the river, which was pretty steep and I swore I was going to fall off the hill after tripping on some roots.  I cruised along the trail for a while til it crossed the Creek, and I ended up on Beach Drive, running in a tunnel somewhere near the National Zoo.    I ran down to Whitehaven/Dumbarton Oaks cutoff and headed up the hill, promising I'd be done once I got to the top, and I'm telling you I was.  I walked up the hill to my apartment and I'd been running for more than an hour and a half.  I was sweat-soaked and burned out, but I felt good.  Maybe if I run like that every day and don't eat a half-tub of ice cream like I did an hour later I'll be in shape for the Skyline Trail.  Now if I could just afford a ticket.         ",0

I realize this will reduce my free time to absolute zero, but at least my bank account won't be there, as well, right?  Right.  So yesterday I scouted airfare to Louisville (yeah, Kentucky Derby!), Belize (yeah, Jason!), and a few other places.  And I had no way of knowing at the time, but after watching the video of Sasha in Kenya helping the Lost Boys, I really want to go there for a while.  Yeah, I know... me.  In Africa.  Weird.  Anyway, it won't happen, I'm sure, but it's a fun thoguht to entertain, no?  Mary's doing well so far in Moscow.  She's met up with a couple friends from the Middlebury program, and they're giving her, I'd imagine, valuable insight into what to do while she's there.  She's living with an older lady, much like our Yia Yia, who loves to feed her at all hours of the day.  Heh.  My friend Katie introduced me to some really great music last night... Joey Eppard.  Really awesome stuff.  I've been listening nonstop.  Check out 'Static.'  And anything else you find, for that matter.  Went to the Cape this weekend with Nate after the BU show.  Hyannis Sound board meeting was this weekend, so Slick, Rellz, Dave Petrelli, Judd, Rob, Townsend, Bonk, Mikey B, Largay, Dawg, Wrobz, and Fozz were all in attendance at Rob and Damia's house.  Great, great weekend.  Nate and I got there too late to catch Fozz and Largay, but were psyched to find Garvey, Garvin, Becky and Caroline there.  100 days to go.  Tomorrow we hit double digits.

I have worked very hard at buying dvd's without hubby finding out, and now I can't watch any!  I really need to go buy a new one, but, that would require me to go and pick one out...I haven't decided what features I would like.  Right now, we have a disk carousel...which I was originally very excited about...other than my movie obsession, I have a music obsession...which reminds, me...I need to turn on some music, hold on.  Okay, I'm back.  Anyway, the disk carousel doesn't automatically bounce to the next disc once one is done.  That sucks.  So, I am not sure I really need that feature since it doesn't do what I want anyway...then, after I do buy one, I have to try to figure out the wiring again...now, hopefully, this will be very easy.  Hopefully, the same plugs that I used on the broken one will just need to be put into a new one.

I knew I went to middle school with him (4th or 5th grade)...he remembered where I live!  I guess we rode the same bus, which I didn't recall.  Once again proving this town is way too small!  Last weekend was another wedding.  This time, one of hubby's roommates from college.  It was pretty fun.  Met some of the rednecks from up north who cracked me up...  Well...the layoffs have started.  My boss still thinks I will be okay through at least the summer.  It is going to be so hard.

A lot of my friends are aliens, so if they lose their jobs, they have 30 days to find a new job or else they have to leave the country...the man at work.  It's just sad to watch, and I worry about these guys.  Some of them are holding that rod awfully tight...I pray they can deal when it happens...

The twilight hike was programmed to demonstrate how the forest changes from day to night...the types of animals that come out, the different sounds...the way our eyes adjust perfectly. We had no flashlights or lanterns, but could find our way without trouble. At the end of the hike, the Harvest Moon was rising over the forest. It started out low in the sky, rotund and orange-yellow. Within fifteen minutes, it had gained significant altitude and was blazing white. One of my fellow hikers lent me her binoculars to get a closer look at our magnificent moon.

"433","470861","indUnk","                 Before I discuss the big thing I need to discuss, there are two things that I need to get off my chest immediately.  I couldnt possibly go forward with this entry without clearing my mind of these thoughts first.  1) Sometimes life is funny.  Sometimes it is absurd.  Sometimes Monica Lewinsky ends up as the host of a television show called  Mr. Personality .  Truth is, I hate every being of HER personality so much that I wish she was the one wearing a mask.  I wish I didnt even have to blog about her.  She doesnt deserve the space I have to offer.  But after her ranting and raving on last nights episode, I thought that it was only fair that I write a short paragraph about why she deserves to never EVER be on television again.  First off, she sucks.  Literally.  Bitch is internationally known for having presidential jizz on both her mouth and her clothing.  Whatever opinion anyone has on this subject, the truth remainsshe is a worldwide jizz eater.  Second, you have entertainment talent??  I mean WHAAA??  Most hosts of reality television have no talent as a rule, but MonicaMonica seriously shouldnt even be allowed to get a headshot.  Why WOULD SHE?  Shes a jizz eater.  Not an entertainer.  Thirdly, as I sit and watch Monica Doublechinsky talk to the other members of the show, I am appalled at her lack of interesting things to say, but mostly at her lack of class when addressing the suitors.  When one of the contestants quit due to the pressure of the game (FUCKING LAME!!), Monica FREAKS out and gives the whole group the most annoying and condescending lecture on being a man.  We have rules, people, and you must follow them.  If you dont want to be a part of this process anymore, be a MAN and wait until the selection has made.   And lastly (fourthly), she takes herself so fucking seriously that I cant possibly hold down my anger laden vomit.  When she does anything, but stand there statuesque, I find myself scraping my fingers down the side of my face.  MY GOD I HATE THIS WOMAN.  Mostly becauseGET THE FUCK OFF THE TELEVISION!  You arent an actress!  You are someone who was made famous because of nonsense.  Now wipe your mouth and go back to your cave.    2) I happened to catch the E(!) True Hollywood Story of my one and only love, Nell Carter, this weekend.  Not much of the special shook me up, but then during the last two minutes of the show, they throw in a HUGE secret.  Nell Carter is a lesbian?  Lesbiawhaaaaaa???  WHO KNEW!  Surely not me.  And I AM a lesbian.  I dont get it.  Why are some people tortured for their sexuality and some people are just left alone?  Nell had a very difficult life and I am not saying that she should have been tortured.  But how did it slip by me that she was lesbionic.  I still sit here shocked and am a little upset that she didnt tell me about it when she was still alive.  Nellieoh Nellie.  Had I only known who you truly were when you were still alive.  Sadness fills my heart.  OkI feel much better now.  Is it wrong to say that I wish Nell Carter was alive right now instead of Monica Lewinsky?   Yes Joe.  Yes, that is wrong to say.  Last night Paul and I did something that we havent done in months!  We hooked up!   UM!  I KNOW!  See, this is how it all went down  Paul and I begin watching  The Simpsons  at 6:30pm.  We are getting along wonderfully; laughing, hugging, playing who can stand the longest pinch.  I called my Pot Guy because Paul was in the mood to smoke a fatty joint with me.  I wasnt much in the mood for getting the pot, but was trying to be as amiable as possible.  As we were joking around, I happened to notice that he was sporting a pretty hefty boner.  I thought Nows my chance.  I can use this opportunity to get us over the weirdness of starting back in with our long lost physical relationship.  I gently began playing with his dick, wondering if he was going to pull away from me, as he does every time I begin to turn the moment sensual.  It indeed was the right moment.    Here is what happened next:  Joe:  (fingering the shaft of his cock) Can I kiss you? Paul:  I dont know if we should do this. Joe:  Can I kiss you? Paul:  Ok. Joe:  (Begins to kiss Paul lightly on the lips, all the while playing with his cock and balls) Paul:  (Kisses back, but body language indicates that he is nervous and uncomfortable)  Eventually, the moment escalated to my kissing him down his chest, onto his stomach, and then to his boxer briefs.  I begin nibbling on the outside of the cloth and he relaxed.  He gave in to me.  I stripped off his boxers and began giving him the most amazing blow job that I could give.  He started breathing heavier and faster and I began going to town.  I wasnt at all worried about pleasing me.  My hope was to get our relationship back on track.  Having not been intimate with him over the last two-three months has certainly placed us in a very awkward position in our relationship.  As I am about to get him off, the phone rings.  The Pot Guy.    I groan and pick up the phone and tell him where to meet up with me.  Paul immediately stands up and says:  Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today.  My jaw hit the floor.  I stood there, not knowing whether to cry, or to punch him in the face.  I slowly put on my shoes, grabbed the money, and head out the door.  During the entire walk to and from meeting up with Pot Guy, I kept running his comments over and over in my head.    Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today. Well that was that.  And when you get back, I wont be horny anymore.  So were done for today.  By the time I got back to the apartment, I was fuming angry.  I walk in and sit down on his bed, next to him.  I sit quietly staring at the television.  Paul:  Whats wrong? Joe:  Nothings wrong. Paul:  Please tell me whats wrong. Joe:  Paul, what do you THINK is bothering me? Paul:  Ok.  I shouldnt have said what I did before you left the apartment.  It was wrong of me. Joe:  Yes it was wrong of you.  I feel so embarrassed and betrayed by you.  You are making no effort to improve this aspect of our relationship.  At this point, we say we are in love, but if we dont start making love soon, we are done.  I am not going to spend my time trying to make my boyfriend want me when he has no interest in it. Paul:  I do want you.  I just dont know how to get back to the place that we were at before everything went wrong. Joe:  Everything didnt go wrong.  You just gave up.  I am 25 years old Paul and I get hit on DAILY by people. Do you think that I have no libido at all and just dont care about being intimate with people?  Cuz if thats what you think, then you are sorely mistaken.  PaulI am going to cheat on you.  I am.  We fix this or you come to grips with the fact that the next time an attractive male hits on me, which will be SOON, I am going to take him up on the offer, and I am not going to feel bad about it.  I have tried with you over and over to help in whatever way I can.  But its not working and all you do in reciprocation is shut me down and make me feel bad.  I am done.  Paul sits on the bed staring at me for awhile and eventually puts his hand on my leg.  Paul:  I want to work on this with you.  I need to take this slow.  I dont want you to be with anyone else, but I dont know if I can give you what you want right now. Joe:  As long as you understand the point I am trying to make.  I laid next to him on the bed and we began to kiss and touch again.  Our cocks sprang to attention and we cautiously played with each others members.  (members = lame term for COCKS)  As we began to hook up again, I felt him start to pull back.    Joe:  You said you wanted to take this slow, so lets just each masturbate.  We can do it together and we can make it casual and easy. Paul:  Ok.  I would like to do that. Joe:  Can we kiss while we do it? Paul:  Yes.  And that we did.  We came together for the first time in months last night.  He was very happy with the way things turned out and I pretended that I was to.  When I was in the bathroom cleaning up, tears pricked at my eyes.  I wasnt as happy with the outcome as he was.  Its a first step and it will hopefully get better from here.  But if it doesnt  If it doesnt, than Paul and I are going to have to have another talk about his willingness to participate in our relationship.    All in all, it was a step in the right direction.    Too bad Monica Lewinsky had to go and ruin everything when she showed her fat head on my television.                   ",0

How did you contact the particular company? Describe the interviewing process. Did you work part-time or as a contractor/consultant with the company before being hired? How long was the process from your first contact with the company to your first day of work? Describe your emotional state during the process. Were you anxious? Excited? Stressed? Impatient?

"444","449628","indUnk","        Effectiveness Tip of the Week    The Delicacies of Delegation   Parents, managers, and people in general have trouble letting go, and when they do, it's gofer mania!  'Hey, you!  Go for this and go for that.'  It's pretty hard to supervise even one person when you are involved in every move he/she makes.  Effective delegation focuses on results, not methods, and allows others to use their imagination, free will, and conscience to get the job done.  Here's some advice:   Desired Results.  Clearly articulate what needs to be done, not how to do it.  Describe in detail the desired result so that the other person virtually sees it.  Guidelines.  Make sure there are parameters within which people are to operate.  Point out potential failure paths -- what not to do versus what to do.  Resources.  Help people understand what human, financial, technical, or organizational resources are available to them.  Accountability.  Set up standards of performance that will be used in evaluating results and when those evaluations will occur.  Consequences.  Specify what will happen, both good and bad, as a result of the evaluation. Effective delegation -- gofer it!    ",0

All I have to do during my remaining days here is go around post getting signatures from different areas of administrations to out processes so I can leave. Showing up to the morning accountability formation is the only obligation I have to the company now, which kinda sucks because I have to get up at 6:00am every morning to walk to formation stand around for like thirty minutes then go back to my room to go back to sleep for another two hours, get up and do what ever else I have left. Which isn't a lot.    I am almost done, so I usually end up sitting in my room watching TV or play video games with Ryan. He gets off work at 2:00pm every day so it works out okay for us to have the whole rest of the day to spend together.       My birthday is coming up on Saturday. I'm pretty excited, although I'm not sure what Ryan has planned. He has bought me presents and has been excited to give them to me.    I will be turning 24, funny I don't feel older.

"461","4293254","Student","       I can't believe all the crazy things that happened this past weekend. The weird part of it is, is that everything is working out okay, I guess. It seems interesting the way Sofie called me a blabber mouth a while ago, and then wonders why she 'bothers' me. I guess why Sofie suddenly comes to mind is because of all the people invovled in this situation I think she could be the one to 'handle' it better. I understand where Drew came from, yes he did break a few bonds, but it's not like John didn't already know who liked him. It's rather obvious. The thing is, is that I don't think people realized how close John and Nicole were because the way everyone is acting right after they broke up is insane. I don't know this is just my opinion, maybe I'm rather confused. All I know is I care about John and I hope he takes his time recooperating. love,Nikki     ",0
"462","4288811","indUnk","       My ex-gf really wasnt worth. I just know it, but i cant accept the fact. I could have given her everything. I had my exs in the past, but never felt this way before. She has her way of realllly (and i mean realllly) hurting a person's feelings. She has a polite manner but it feels like it suits the case of 'dont judge a book by its cover' sort of thing. She has some sort of mood swing which really puzzles me till now. She would say something today, and would say the opposite tomorrow. She would always say to me that she wants to fix our r.ship and so on, and being a complete  urlLink J@cKa$$  the next day. The irony...  After so many fights, even out of a r.ship (i lost count) .  We're still at it. Ive never been this patient in my life. I resorted to sending her notes, calling her which ends up with her throwing away the note, not picking up calls. Till 1 day, she decided to be smart enough and actually listened (yay!) . It isnt worth . It ended up the same thing everyday. Its just a continuous cycle which will never end .  Fast forward, yesterday she text messaged me. Probably enjoying herself seeing my sadness taking over. It ended up wit me saying something like 'grow up!', just trying to knock herself into conciousness. She could get angry and doesnt expect me to get any emotional feelings from her manipulating it.  A lot of things actually happened in our r.ship , and i wish i could express it, but i dont think there would be enough time for me ... Basically , she feels powerful or some sort that i go to her everytime (to fix things u know) even in our r.ship . She doesnt feel wrong that she could break all the rules but i have to follow hers. Sry, but enough is enough . I have my limits.  She did a lot of things to me . That includes backstabbing , heartbreaking , + many others.Which affected my friends and so on...

Why? I ask myself this often. I enjoy it. It is a doorway to another dimension on this earth and takes me far away from the stresses of daily living. Why don't I put pencil to paper more often? Where could it take me if I made it my ultimate goal? If I committed myself to every artistic whim, every request and every idea I've ever had, how many drawings and paintings would I have? How many would see and how many would want my art? Imagine.  There is a part of everyone in the mind of an artist, I as an artist, take it and translate it onto paper in a perfect vision and the people see themselve without ever knowing it and never ask why.  my best friends and family, those that are around me that I care deeply about.

Since paper & pen are not always handy I decded to go to the virtual route.  I've been thinking alot about lists and writing my thoughts down.    This session I talked about the wall that I feel.  The wall that I feel when I want to let go.  Like last friday when I was out dancing with Dante and I could not just let it go and dance.  I feel this wall when I want to talk to people sometimes, like this morning when I put the  gate up on Daves room so Rocky won't attack Dante when she comes over.

"473","4253344","Education","            Why are we Human are so stubborn? We have this habit of realising out mistakes yet we will repeat. Similarly, when we know something is wrong, yet we will do it. A guy friend of mine ever told me, he knows that sometimes it is wrong to do something, yet he will tend to make that mistakes, but what he can do is to avoid making mistakes. This is indeed human nature of making mistakes repeatedly, but it is a matter of out self control and our own self in preventing outselves from making the mistakes. I reckon the tendency to make a mistake can be controlled by out will. The intention or desire to do something is one thing, but whether you will do or not is another issue. In my previous article of 'Feelings', it is out brains that control what we do, however, if we let the feelings control, there will just exist the greater likelihood of making mistakes. I have a friend telling that he had so many regrets and he said he is meant to be like that and never be a good person. However, I always believe 'there is will, there is a way'. This is a matter of whether or not you have this determination. There is so many things in life that we can accomplish, it is just a matter of whether we want to make it happen or not. We may not make it a perfect one, yet we try and that effort will be appreciated. Of course, Do not give yourself so much pressure in doing a good job, what is important is doing what is like and what is right. Just be yourself! Dear friends, you all are special in your own way! That is why I appreciate all of you, every single one of you is my good friend. Knowing you all is a matter of fate and this is something that we cannot ask for. Just have a look at the world population, there are so many people. Yet we can get along together, I really treasure this friendship. ",0
"474","4242079","Student","           Ok. A few things to get straight here. So you think it's sad about how I sulk about my ex-girlfriend. Take a look at my last few posts...it has been quite some time since I've actually written about her. Sure, I still feel some feelings of sadness, but look, THEY'RE NOT FUCKING ON HERE, RETARD. Fools around with others eh? Yeah, so it was a mistake. It was done out of lust and anger, and I apologize to those who got hurt. So unless you're her, then it doesn't fucking concern you. And besides, I didn't sleep with her and tell her I didn't like her like that. I slept with her and told her it happened way too fast and I wasn't ready for that. Then she left and found Chad or Dom or whatever his name is. I am very happy that she's happy with him. SO SHUT THE FUCK UP IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE WHOLE GOD DAMMED STORY. Yes, I was holding hands with Nikki a couple days ago. And yes, I kiss her occasionally too. So sue me for trying to move on with my life (isn't that what you want me to do, is try to move on, DUH!). She knows where I stand, and where she stands. We're being careful not to let things get out of hand before I'm ready for anything serious. So again, if you don't know the whole fucking story, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT! By the way, Nobody else here seems to have a problem putting their name, regardless of what they have to say. If you're going to talk trash about me, fine, maybe I deserve it, but at least have the decency to reveal your identity. Even if it is only to me, I will keep your name off the site if you just drop me an e-mail containing your name.   in response to a previous anonymous commenter  i personaly think its sad how he sulks about his ex girlfriend and then fools around with others, telling them he likes them, then acting all confused and not forgeting about the past and not giving the other girl a chance. In fact i think its sad how he sleep with another girl, tells her he doesnt like her like that and leaves her in the dark. Starts bitching about his ex some more of how much he wants her back while a couple days ago hes holding hands with ANOTHER girl. Not his ex, nor the girl he slept with. Yeah i say hes got some issues to work on.          ",0

"476","4234196","Education","   Just posting a little update regarding the day.  We had a staff meeting this morning to review the procedures for the start of school with respect to the death of Mr. Bird.  There will be a general meeting in the gym for 8th and 9th graders to discuss his passing and there will be a number of crisis team members on the grounds to talk with teachers and kids as needed.  I then met with Guy and two teachers that will be teaching Computer classes this year.  Neither teacher has much experience with computers at all and I was pleased that, as we went through most of the terms and procedures, as well as the programs that we will be covering, that I knew most of the topics of the 'curriculum' already.  I had an idea about my goal for the classes and my participation this session.  I ran it by Guy and he is all for it.  The North Fork Lab, our classroom, has a couple of faded bulletin boards and some ancient Apple 'think different' posters on the walls.  We don't even have Apple computers anymore.  I would like to use our computer graphics class to have kids create some computer artwork to start a gallery in the lab.  They do it in the Media Center, I think it would be great thing for the lab, as well.  I will work this into the classes later in the year, if possible.  Talked with Randy, a math teacher, about Guy.  He told me the story about how Guy met his wife (Randy set them up.)  He says that Guy is a great teacher, sometimes unorthodox, but that he gets great results from his kids.  Guy does not seem to have any written lesson plans or syllabi, he just knows what he is going to teach and he teaches it.  Alot of the progress in his classes appears to be the students branching out on their own and learning how to do things.  This will be a neat process to watch.  At the moment, Guy is off taking care of some 'coaching' stuff, so I am set free for awhile.  I may try to find Jay and see about lunch.  I saw Stephen here this morning.  I think that he is observing social studies procedures with Megan, a PP13 graduate, for the day.  I will be back here at 1:00, when we have to get the classroom ready for tomorrow.  This mostly will involve moving the CPUs for each workstation into place, cleaning up, etc.        Time for lunch. ",0

"480","4224880","Tourism","       just wanted to get everyone's attention.  this was going to just go in the comments section since if you haven't read ziks' post: 'wheel in the sky keeps on turning', you will be totally lost.  however, it got really long and i feel math should always make the main page.  so ziks,  close, young skywalker.  starting hands, check.  there are indeed 10810 ways of getting 2 cards to a straight flush...of a particular suit. gotta multiply by 4 to cover all of the options. luckily in the world of probablility almost everything is multiplied so we can do that at the end. 4 * (10810/270725) * (946/1533939) is 9.8501e^-5  but wait, what about this scenario:AD, 2D, AS, 2S  then you have 2 chances to get the straight flush from the board.  there are (5 c 2) times (5 c 2) ways to get this stroke of luck given 2 specific suits. since it matters not what 2 suits are paired, we can multiply this by (4 c 2). so this is 10 * 10 * 6.  we can plug that 600 into the system to get (600/270725) * (946/1533939) * 2(twice as many chances to complete the flush) = 2.7336e^-6  of course, before adding remember that we already covered 1/2 of these 600 options earlier so divide by 2 first.  final probability: 2.7336e^-6 + 9.8501e^-5 = 101.2346e^-6  this yields .01012346%  of course that number doesn't mean too much since you never go into a hand looking for a straight flush of that calibur. the 946/1533939 (.06%) is the one that you should think about when choosing to bet to the sky in hopes of catching it on the river or whatever it is in omaha.  of course it's up to .12% if you have a double draw. time to get the deed to the house!  as far as your other concern, as long as the cards are face down and no one else can change the 5 cards that get dealt to the board, it doesn't matter where you sit or the number of people. it's like saying what are the odds of getting the ace of spades after i take one face down. you can either look at it as 'what's the probability of card 2 being the ace of spades,' or the long way: prob of you getting it if i have it plus prob of you getting it if i dont have it. if i do, 0% + if i dont (51/52 * 1/51) or 1/52. this type of thing happens on a much greater level than i have time to explain at the poker table. but if you can't see the cards and no one can change the table's hand based on what they see, it doesn't matter.  it's the same reason why you ALWAYS take the second door in 'Let's Make a Deal.' Always, always, always.  for those unfamiliar, captain douche would offer you a prize behind one of 3 doors.  he'd let you choose one door, but before opening it, would open one of the other 2(always empty) and then ask if you want to change your mind. you'd think its 50/50, but it isn't.  the difference here is he knew which door to open since he knows where the prize is. there's no chance of him actually opening the prize door.  the easiest way to show this is that if you always switch, the ONLY time you will lose is if you picked the right door the first time.  and the odds of that happening are only 1/3.  math = wonderful. now to see if raytheon'll pay for me to get a piece of paper allowing me to teach it on the side.

"483","4217848","Student","        I've been thinking a lot lately about trying to be something you aren't. You know, 'Ugly Duckling Syndrome.' These days, everyone seems to be masquerading a little too much lately. And, even worse, they seem to be stepping out from behind the mask as something I never imagined them to be. Not that it's a bad thing (well, not all the time), but so often things are different once we realize that our brethren were never really one of us. Or, rather, we were never one of them. When they turn out to be so much more complex and beautiful than we ever knew, we are humbled that we ever doubted them. Yet all too often I've found that people were much uglier inside than I had deemed them.  Some of us have an awful tendency to conceal so much of what we are to find another part of us that we know isn't there. What we are REALLY doing is just trying to impress someone, or fit in when we know that if someone cared about us, they would accept us for what we are. All these little games we play only complicate things, especially when we didn't know we were playing a game, or, worse, when we knew but didn't care.  Not feeling accepted or loved is one of the worst feelings in the world. Believe me, I know. Still, it's worse to feel like the only reason anybody cares about you is because you are being what they tell you too.     Keeping it real, Hunter M. ",0

"486","4208064","Consulting","             'What do you mean you are still going to talk to him?' This is how it all starts when it comes to my wife with concern in my 'Friends.' Here I will give a brief over view. I have two friends that I consider my 'bestest good friends' as a matter of fact my first son is named after them Jayson and Jaycob. Jake on one hand is a reserved well thought out kind of person (he rarely makes good decisions in life for himself in the past anyway) and then there is Jayson the loud obnoxious, egotistical, arrogant,pompous, pig.... You get the idea. He from what Jake and myself can gather has to have a mental condition, for he is absolutely convinced that every woman either wants him or he has been with and on top of that he tries to live like we did in high school (drink all night, hook up with just about anyone, fight just for the fun of it, among other things I rather not reveal at this point ;) ) . But, all that aside he is still like a brother to Jake and myself, at least that is what we consider each other as. So here is the deal, Jake and myself both have relationships and Jason does to but the difference is that he has little respect for his girls feels and is more then happy to talk about all the woman he has been with right in front of her. That is no biggie because that is his relation and whatever he does there is fine. The problem comes in when he disagrees with someone i.e. our misses. He is an @$$ hole and tends to go off with a vengeance. While Jake and I have grown to deal with his horrible behavior they have not and then as if they are not pissed enough at him then they come to us talking about how they hate him and expect us to do something. This is the part where it gets sticky. He is our 'Bro' and I know he is a total @$$ hole, but you know what he has been there when no one else was and for that I will never stop talking to him nor will Jake.

Which is why my ramblings will be a secondary part of this experiment. :-)  This blog is not about me; it's about what I go through on a daily basis. It's about antiquated Latin phrases and English words that don't mean what they should mean. It's about... LAW SCHOOL.  From the millions of pages I read each day, a few choice thoughts or phrases  pop out  at me. They are words that made me stop and think, or chuckle, or often even cry. These are the words that grab my attention during the day, and keep me up at night. They are published in my case books, and said by professors and students in class. They are law school.

I'll put more commentary.      Meh.  Maybe later.      In other news:       LOWELL, Mass. (AP), Aug. 21    - A man apparently on a cocaine binge died after he stripped naked, ran through a restaurant stabbing himself with a pen and tried to electrocute himself during a violent struggle with police.    ``Apparently, there was a witness, a girlfriend, who has indicated to us that he took cocaine intravenously, and this may have created this bizarre behavior,'' said police Superintendent Kenneth Lavallee.     Richard Wheeler, 33, of Lowell, went into the DoubleTree Hotel early Friday, grabbed a pen from the front desk and ran into the restaurant, said Verdell Ekberg, spokesman for DoubleTree's parent company, Procaccianti Group of Providence.     ``He was hurting himself, stabbing himself with the pen,'' Ekberg told The Sun of Lowell. He said Wheeler was not a hotel guest.     When police arrived, Wheeler - who had stripped naked - attacked the officers.     During a struggle in the restaurant kitchen, Wheeler tried to grab the officers' guns, threw a coffee carafe at an officer and urged police to shoot him. He also tried to stick his fingers in electrical sockets, police said.     `They attempted to restrain him as best they could,'' Lavallee said. ``They were able to do that, but it was after some time and a protracted struggle with this gentleman.''     He was taken, screaming and thrashing, to Saints Memorial Medical Center, where he later died.     An autopsy report was awaiting toxicology test results, but the death did not appear to be a homicide, said Melissa Sherman, spokeswoman for District Attorney Martha Coakley.     Three officers were injured, Lavallee said.       Silly Richard.  Crack is for kids...    (Does that count as commentary, Sophie?)              ",0

The Paris-based media watchdog demanded 'an immediate explanation' for the move on Saturday, saying it was 'extremely concerned about persistent episodes of censorship in Iraq'. Police ordered al-Jazeera's employees out of their newsroom and locked the door on Saturday night after the prime minister accused the pan-Arab satellite channel of inciting violence. 'They have been showing a lot of crimes and criminals on TV, and they [send] a bad picture about Iraq and about Iraqis and encourage criminals to increase their activities,' Iraq's interior minister, Falah al-Naqib, said. Al-Naqib said the closure was intended to give the station 'a chance to readjust their policy against Iraq'. Prime minister Ayad Allawi cited the hoax videotape broadcast by the channel on Saturday that appeared to show an American being beheaded as an example of the coverage he opposed. 'I am worried about these people,' he said. 'I am not worried about whether al-Jazeera will like it or not.' A spokesman for the channel today said it showed just eleven seconds of the hoaxter's tape and went to great lengths afterwards to discuss how it had been duped by the American who had put the footage on the internet. Mr Allawi brushed off criticism of the move, saying that the network's coverage of kidnappings encouraged terrorists.     I think that this is a dangerous precedent to begin, yes, they have a different view. But isnt that what news stations are about? Different news stations provide different views.              ",0
"497","4192173","Technology","             The Rollercoaster I am on called ComicCon continues to run me ragged. I won't bore you with my true reasons for being here, thats part of my OTHER life, but I will tell you that it is exciting and exhausting to the extreme. I wouldn't trade the opportunity to be here for anything, its that much fun!  First off: Irene is down in DC, but is a winner here in SD as I have not only gotten her a rare NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS item (Kubrick related, of course) but she about to be the proud owner of a personally autographed lithograph by her fave artist, Mr. Michael Turner. I don't know Mr. Turner very well, but I appreciate his going to the extra step to personalize the autograph for my significant other. I think she's gonna be happy...  While working as well as searching for gifts for the nephew, cousin, and girlfriend, I took the opportunity, as I do every year here, to make some time for myself and attend the annual STAR WARS presentation along with 6,999 other people. This is always a highlight, especially when there is a new movie on the horizon. I'll skip over the details, you can always find them on the SW website, but being there for the first announcement of the new movie title, REVENGE OF THE SITH, at the end of the presentation, was something special for a diehard like myself. However, this is just where the fun begins...  Immediately after announcing said title, Steve Sansweet, the Lucas 'guy' who gives these presentations, displayed a new tshirt with the new movie title/logo on it and announced the shirt would be onsale in 'Five minutes at the Star Wars Pavillion' (which is huge, fyi). Well, you dont say that kinda of thing to 7,000 insane fans, who all then RAN, and I mean RAN to get the tshirt. I didnt rush as I had calls to return, but when I made it to the line, there were literally THOUSANDS of people in front of me. In fact, Con security had to cut the line for safety reasons and of course, I was part of the line that was cut. RRRRR.  Frustrated, I went on my way, not realizing I was walking past the back of the pavillion where said shirts were being sold. The securtiy people were so busy forcing people against the wall that they basically left the SW salespeople/cash registered unblocked, so yours truly had no problem walking RIGHT UP and buying a tshirt within 3 minutes and before they even let anyone get there!! In my perverted mind, I am the first person to ever buy a REVENGE shirt, but I know its not true, but ALLOW me the moment, ok? I got lucky here and was so scared that they were gonna bust me that I ran off as soon as I purchased the shirt. Within seconds, someone from Lucasfilm had grabbed me. I was ready to give the shirt back, but it was actually the girl working the register giving me my change!! I was so excited that I split before getting my money. While I am a sith badass for cutting thousands of people on line, she would make an honorable jedi for bringing me my change. Cheers to Lucascashregisterchick.  My other highlight of the evening: While on my way to dinner with a wonderful TV actress who I grew up watching and having a major crush on, I was stung by a bee for the first time in my life. It SUCKED. I don't recommend it. Especially when dining with TV stars. However, it was a great conversation piece, especially when putting a bag of ice on my swelling neck. Fortunately, no allergic reaction. Yet. Pray.  So its back to the Con for a bit tomorrow, then off to LA again for the week. I'm tired, but I have seen the wookie planet and thats enough to make me happy and sleep well.   Goodnight, all!  F           ",0
"498","4189191","Arts","                 Assertions made but not proved.....  I have been having an ongoing debate with a friend from Australia. Do Creative Writing Schools help?  I have not taken any sides on the subject really, though I have been arguing from the side that they don't. More due to friend's assertions that they do. The matter would have ended in a single e-mail exchange had I agreed.  But do they really help? I gathering of people interested in writing is always valuable, it helps in knowing the different ideas, helps you make up your mind about yours. But other than that, could anyone really teach you how to write a good novel or a short story.   What first is a good opening, a good novel, a good read. Hard to say with the amount of diversity available. Like how Justice Stewart described pornography really. When I read a good opening, I know it. When I read a good book I just know it.  To me a novel, literary fiction and not the genres, has been something that comes from the heart. A novel should be a moan of anguish, a scream of exasperation. A lullaby, a giver of hope. How then do you ask someone to moan in anguish or scream in exasperation? How do you teach a mother to sing a lullaby or a preacher to fill you with hope?  I attended a brief session on Creative Writing lately. What I learnt from there was of little value. Because what was being taught was how to catch an agent's attention, a publisher's eye. All very good, because without that what you are writing might just remain a pile of paper in your cabinet. But are the publishers really looking for just that. If they indeed are, good writers are in great trouble. Innovation would stop and if innovation stops, progress stops as well.    Writing to me has been a purely inward process. I have not found any help outwards for it. But then I would have loved to have a few people with whom I could have debated or conversed about many aspects of writing from time to time. Discuss if A were telling a story of B and C how best to handle the narrative, part first person, part third person. A really diverse debate on that would have done me a lot of good. A collection of people in a writing school then might be of help. But if I were asked to share a half done work, a part of a bigger work I would balk, it would be akin to having someone examine and critic a single spice that was used in preparing a complex dish.  When a friend asked if I would mind sending him the first and second draft of the novel I was writing I had to reply I would. I would be almost like strolling in a shopping mall with your fly unzipped.   Any thoughts on this, anyone?             ",0

"500","4187516","Education","                 One reason columnists and comedians will be sad to see President Bush go is because of the loss of actual quotes to write and joke about.  He's a cornucopia of material. For instance yesterday the President spoke to a rally in nearby Annandale, Virginia.  As reported in The DailyPress.com (Hampton, Virginia):   'Bush criticized Kerry's plan to eliminate the tax cuts for those making more than $200,000 a year, saying that the 'the rich in America happen to be the small business owners' who put people to work.    Bush also said high taxes on the rich are a failed strategy because 'the really rich people figure out how to dodge taxes anyway.'    Kind of reminds you of the clip in Fahrenheit 9/11 where the President talks to his supporters, '...The Haves and the Have More,' at a black tie dinner. If I follow his logic we should do away with many of our laws because criminals figure out to dodge them anyway. Hmmmmm.   However there's a statement in the last paragraph of the story by a Bush supporter at the rally.  Talking about Kerry supporters who were protesting at the rally, she said,   'I just look at them and smile,' she said.  'They're damn lucky to be in this country because they would be backslapped if they lived anywhere else. I just pray that they will open their eyes.'    I have to agree with her that it is a privilege to have the freedom to express ones feelings, but I get the feeling that she's one of those people who think it's OK to express ones feelings as long as you agree with me.

I wonder if any of the other boardies (people on the Slingshot 57 message boards) will be at the concert tonight. By the way, the concert is at Christ United Methodist Church in Indianapolis. The cost is something like $5, but we'll have Mom with us.                                         *some time after that*      Yay! Mom's home. We'll be leaving in a few minutes. Oh I hope we get there all right.  Unfortunatly, we aren't very familiar with Indianapolis.  Oh well, God will get us through it.                     *after being in the car for 2 hours and 30 minutes*      Are we there yet? Where is this place?  We've done 3 U-turns so far.   Not to mention Mom just tried to get directions to the church at a Subway drive-thru!  Man, that was the so embarrassing, but it was also funny in a few ways. I wonder what they thought of us. *Gasp!* What is that?! Why is there bunches of blow-up things over there? Oh look! There's a sign! *girlish scream* It's the church!!!!! Woohoo!

Nick played a beat on his drums that made Paul dance. Do it again!!!!! Please?! Ah man! That's not fair. Oh well, maybe at the next concert.                               *after the show, talking to the guys*      'Sarah, you should go by 'SBD.' That way we can call you 'Silent But Deadly.' After all, you don't talk much in person,' said Ben and Paul agreeing to torture me with my name as long as we live.                                              *to the present*      Well, we got home much easier than we did going there. Now, I sign off as 'Silent.' So I don't fully allow people to make fun of me. My theory on that is 'Silent' for I don't talk much in person, 'But Deadly' for my extreme craziness with silly string and on the message boards. After all, I am the top #1 poster on there.

So I got home last night from work, and got ready to leave for shopping with mi madre. I had a pair of pants that I had to return to Victoria's Secret but they wont take them back at the stores that are in the mall so the 'kind lady at the counter' told me that I will have to pay (more spendage!! yay!!) to ship them back. I thought about telling her where SHE could ship have them shipped to, but only because I've already paid close to $60.00 for these damn pants.       .So then we left. I went into American Eagle and saw all of the amazingly cute sweatshirts... but I was reminded of Marie's words about how sweatshirts dont look flattering on anyone so I didnt buy one... but not because I didnt think that I wouldnt look flattering in it. I buy sweatshirts cause they're more comfortable than anything else. :D But I already have a few... and... they were $50.00.       So then we go through the Bon in search of a bathroom for my mom when I found a clearance rack. YAY for clearance racks!!! I didnt find anything that I really wanted but it was still worth a look. So then we left.       We end up at Old Navy and I went crazy. I got... three shirts, a jean skirt, and a pair of pants. Hey I know girls out there are going 'thats not even CLOSE to how I go crazy in a store' but see... I hate shopping to begin with. AND I NEVER buy skirts. Ever. And I hate shopping for pants... well I just hate shopping in general. So in all I got all those plus a courderoy coat at Costco and I spent under $100. :D Not quite as good as thrift shopping, but still I got a LOT of stuff for under a hundred. :D      Now I get to do the fun shopping. hehe.. shoe shopping!! I dont know how well a jean skirt and tshirt would go with bright pink conversish shoes... but I'll check it out. haha.    Today I get off from work an hour early... they have a dentist appointment, and then I'm going to the thrift store, the gas station, the bank, and the photo shop-- Knox. Spending more money!! yay!! BLEH. At least I get paid at the beginning of next week. Im going to do something with Cassidy tomorrow-- we still dont know what, and then on Friday my six months are up!! yay!!! Sorry I probably wrote about that yesterday and perhaps the day before, but it's exciting. To me. And to Andy probably- since it means we can take longer drives. :D      So- music. I know that some of you out there are really into music. DUH. If you're not then you're an insane (possibly republican) person. Ok so here's some good music to download. If you do not have the means to download then contact me through msn and I'll send it your way. Ok here's a list:       --  The Killers -- On Top, Smile Like You Mean It, Mr. Brightside, Andy You're a Star (maybe I just like this one because of the title--- I dont know if I'd like it so much if it was 'Fred You're A Star' or something like that. Anyways-- moving on) a few others of which I cannot currently remember.    --  Elefant -- Good band- no idea where they are from or any info at all but I like them. They played at the Neubus too but I missed it. Ok: Makeup, Tonight We'll Dance, and Misfit. Misfit is my favorite but Makeup is rather good also.    --  Polyphonic Spree -- I havent listened to these guys to know too many of their songs, but I like 'Light and Day' and someone told me that its on the soundtrack for 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' but I cannot verify that as I have yet to see the movie.    --  Modest Mouse, Postal Service & Death Cab For Cutie -- They are all in the same genre according to Rollingstone.com, but Postal Service and Death Cab for Cutie actually both have the same singer. Interesting eh? Anywho-- They're all really really good bands and so any song of theirs you download is going to be good. For Modest Mouse I would recommend: Float On, Ocean Breathes Salty, and well.. I would just recommend every single song on 'Good News For People Who Love Bad News' and 'Baron von Bullshit Rides Again'. The latter is one that you can only BUY off of modestmousebootlegs.com but it is a VERY good cd. I love it.    .Ok thats it for now about music.    George W. Bush is gracing us with his presence in Medina. For those of you who do not know what Medina is, or WHERE it is, all I should have to say is this: Bill Gates Lives There. You may think 'Medina is hell then?' but what you SHOULD gather from that piece of info is that it is in Seattle. The portion of Seattle that all the rich foggies live. This is a community that refused to pay taxes for the local libraries or police force- because they have their own. HMMM. I think this is funny though because see... Melinda Gates wanted to sign up her two children for library cards at the Bellevue Library (I have spoken to the librarian she spoke with also which I think is hilarious) but they REFUSED to give her library cards, because Medina residents do not pay taxes towards King County Library System. So she was refused. There is a sign on the wall listing the 'Gates Foundation- Bill and Melinda Gates' as a major donator to the Bellevue Library. But they still didnt get their cards. Because their community doesnt pay taxes.       These people are damn rich and they wouldnt let their taxes go towards the libraries. Payback's a bitch aint it Melinda??       Anywho-- sorry for this being so long to all of you out there. Ok so George W. Bush is gracing us with this presence in Medina. Im taking my eggs. Jamie and Andy have heard of this story--- ahem 'plan'-- of mine. I'm going to take raw eggs to a George W. Bush speech, and just chuck it at him in the middle of it. I figure, I've only got a few more months in which to do it because I'm not 18 yet so... the law may treat me nicer if I get caught.... my parents support this also by the way. I think my mom thinks that I'm joking but now that he's in Medina--- how could I pass up the opportunity!?!?    There's a new name up there---  -Jaime--  my friend who shares my name, who I chat with about sex, books movies and music. We kind of just hang out whenever. He's in Whistler right now too. I know that Jamie deserves a much better paragraph than this about his character- but I have confidence that his character will come through in my stories about our adventures. Jamie-- when you get back we're doing the vodka/seagull thing ok? No but's.    So I guess that has brought me to the end of my rant for this morning. So far only have of my charge has awoken. He wants to go work on 'his road' by the 'woods' aka play boat. Talk to you all later!!    Favorite quote from yesterday: [Andy] Thats what I love about you.    [Jaime] That I'm a smartass?    [Andy] It's 109173841098237% better than being a dumbass.      Yay for Andy and Jaime conversations. LoL. Bleh I need to seeeeee Andy.  :( I didnt even get to talk to him last night... damn. Anyways--- kid got out skateboard. Must be off.      ",0

I don't mind listening, helping or sharing advise. But I think I take on the burden of their problems sometimes. Especially if I care for them. I want to help and free them of their pain somehow. What can I do really? Just listen, I guess. Thats all most people want. To get things off of their chests. Is it my personality that makes people gravitate towards me when they are feeling the pressures of their lives? Maybe its just that simple fact..I listen. I need to come out of this doldrum. I took on the burden of someone's problem last night. But there is nothing I can do. Seriously. I did my duty as a friend. I listened, I gave my advise. That helped him a lot and he appreciated it. So why do I still feel blue about it? Empathy is a strong emotion. If only it were sympathy I felt.  Thats an easier emotion. That one rolls off your back once you are done with it. Empathy sticks with you. Ok..now who do I talk to about my blue mood? Thats another one of my problems. Lord I seem to have many. I hold emotion in. It does eat at you but I can't seem to release it. I have been getting better, but not where I should be. I think I feel intimidated by my mouth not being able to formulate logically what my mind is thinking. I KNOW what I need to say, but it always comes out wrong or backwards or not the way I want. So therefore, it stays tumbling around in my brain, making me crazy.               ",0

"514","4168305","Student","       I haven't posted for four days, so thought I'd better write another entry before I stop alltogether.  I got a call today from a careers advisor at my school. Didn't catch most of what she said as I was tired, but she asked if I was coming back to sixth form and what subjects I was doing. She also asked if I was going to school to get my GCSE results. Dunno why she called... It was pointless really. Think I said 'yes' to most of what she asked as I was tired, even though it was around 2pm...  I was just lying in bed day dreaming when she rang. She well fucked it up. I was thinking about Jamie, and how things will be when he moves here. He gets his A Level results this Thursday. Pretty sure he will have done fine, so not sure why he's worried. If he doesn't go to Leeds Met, he'll go to Sheffield. It's not that far...  I'm friends with Wendy now, though we apologised to each other online. She asked if I wanted to go to town this week, but I don't know if I can be arsed. There isn't really anything there to go for. I'd rather go do something like go-karting or paintballing... Or to a theme park. I sooooo wanna go on some rides.  I really really wanna go to Blackpool Pleasure Beach! And the London Dungeon! Grrr. My sister has said when she starts her new job, she'll save up and take me to Blackpool. Knowing her she'll drag me where she wants to go though - she's 23 by the way. Leanne and Wendy have also said they'll go with me, but Leanne won't go on trains... Don't think I'm getting a coach to Blackpool unless getting the train is really expensive.  Oooh that reminds me, they have a fair at Roundhay Park on Bonfire Night! Yay, can't wait. The rides aren't that good, but this year hopefully Jamie will be able to come. They have a really nice fireworks display. It's just getting there that's gonna be a problem. Maybe dad will drop us off... that's if it's not just me and Jamie alone. So may have to ask Wendy and Leanne to come.   Hmm, what else do I have to say? Ooh I can't wait to get my GCSE results. Dunno why, they're bound to be bad. Guess I just wanna see friends really. And I'm still hoping for an A* in ICT! Plus a few B's. Some C's. And two or three D's. Pleeeease don't give me anything lower. I'll feel so stupid because I know if I'd tried hard enough, I could've got all my results C's or higher.  Anyway thats about it for today...     ",0
"515","416458","Technology","       Our WebDAV love affair?  A while ago my company met WebDAV, we spied it across a crowded room and knew instantly that it was the technology that we want to be with, forever. Thus followed a whirlwind romance and a very quick marriage.   Now we have been together for 2 years and the honeymoon is definitely over, but unfortunately we've had kids and now divorce seems as problematic as trying to work around our issues. We have a mistress on the side, SOAP Web Services, to provide what is missing from our relationship with WebDAV. What is to be done.   At this point I should make sure that you understand that I am in no way having a go at the people who have worked tirelessly to bring the WebDAV family of specifications to the point that they are at now. The work they have done is great, on a standard that doesn't have anywhere near the support that it should and one that has been implemented in a bad way many times.   The IETF WebDAV group began officially on March 20th 1997, there is now the core WebDAV specification, DeltaV versioning extensions specification, Ordered Collections, Access Control Extensions and the in progress DASL Searching specification. Pulled together these form, on the surface at least, a well rounded set of specifications, however 2 years is a long time to get to know something.   We started working with WebDAV because our company had instituted research days, once a month, for all the developers. We each got to try out new and interesting things as long as they were something to do with what we do, which is build online information systems with a heavy focus on use of metadata. One of our developers was exploring the idea of layer new interfaces onto the CMS aspect of our server software. He got FTP working, then Telnet and finally tried out WebDAV.   It was a good fit, we have resources to which we allow people to attach metadata, which is exactly what WebDAV gives you. Straight away we ran into 2 problems, the first was that there is no way in WebDAV to supply to the client application the definitions for each of the properties. Secondly there is no agreed way to pass around multiple values for a property. A property can simply contain  &lt;xs:any/&gt;  element.   So we designed extensions to WebDAV for this, which worked well, and completed the implementation of the core specification. We skirted around having to implement the immature versioning specification by simplifying the view over our versioning and relating these through metadata. We used the HTML &lt;ol/&gt; and &lt;li/&gt; constructs for the multiple values, which was a work around proposed by the Dublin Core group. This was the basis for our first release.   Since then we have gone on to expand on the metadata definitions extension, we've move the multiple values constructs over to using the SOAP specification array concepts and implemented DeltaV versioning, Ordered Collections and DASL searching.   To a degree all of this has worked. I say to a degree because there are problems with these specifications. You need only look at the changes in the recent revision to the core specification to begin to understand how much needed clarification. There is not enough integration across the specifications, our implementation of the DeltaV specification had to skirt the lines across 2 of the different implementations flavours to be able to lay on top of our versioning system, which isn't that unusual.   There are missed opportunities, such as the lack of a definition of what a Principal is. In the LOCK specification the lock owner is a URI to information about this user. In the versioning specification there is also talk about users and URIs to information about them and finally in the Access control extension there are Principals, with WebDAV paths to them. However these Principals, and the WebDAV path/URIs, are in no way specified as being the same as the other user URIs. We have assumed this, and gained so much more out of it.   User handling is perhaps the area of greatest weakness, there are others mostly stemming from the specifications not quite explaining things enough (could of course just be me being thick). But yes, user handling is the worst, again not really WebDAV's fault, mostly from the awful way in which HTTP authentication works. We have ended up plugging these gaps with Web Services.   So I guess my advice is that WebDAV worked well for us, it got us up and running fairly quickly without having to design a comms protocol ourselves, but we have spent a long time tailoring and extending it to meet our exact needs, generic though it is you just cannot use it as the sole protocol for an entire system even though it might look like you can at first.   WebDAV and us will not be getting a divorce anytime soon, but I will definitely think twice the next time my eyes meet those of such a lovely technology across a crowded room!          ",0
"516","416458","Technology","       So I'm sitting here at work on a Saturday reading Kieron's blog. I'm not a great blog reader, or in fact poster as you can tell, but Kieron is a mate and I found his blog by accident which makes it more fun to read.  Anyway he's been posting thoughts on the turn of the year and it's something that's always plays on my mind. I guess I'm far too fucking introspective for my own good, but then it's a hobby that you can do anytime, amyplace which is always nice. So how's this year been? Well....  ... it's been the 'Year of the Matt'. Now don't get me wrong, it's not some massive ego trip, quite the opposite. The previous year had been soooo bad that I felt I had to do something big to turn things around. It all started last New Years Eve, I was trudging up a hill about to be very sick (you should know that I don't drinnk this was just from getting ill) looking back over a year where I split up from a fantastic girl because I'm crap at relationships and am affraid of commitment. A year where I'd thrown myself into my work, not spent anywhere near enough time with friends and family. A year where I'd simply lived day to day on a diet of junk food, coffee and cigs. I was well on my way to a heart attack before 30.  So I decided to turn it around. I quit the junk food, no more burgers or chocolate or pizzas. Joined a gym, much to the ammusement of my friends and tried to generally get my shit together.  Has it worked? I hear you all cry, well I guess that's why I'm shit scared about next year. You see you can do all of this for yourself, and feel a lot better about it, but when it comes to getting out there and trying to be a better you with other people it's a whole other matter. I'm not sure if things are better or not, I guess next year will tell.         ",0
"517","4161674","Student","             Remember when TV movies didnâ€™t suck?  It was back in a mythical time called the early 1970s. Why, I remember having to walk twenty miles in a blizzard just to pay the cable bill. Barefoot even!  But it was worth it. And Iâ€™d do it all again in a heartbeat just to get another glimpse of Marcia Brady. TV was wonderful then. Conflicts always came down to a simple matter of black and white and were easily solvable in a thirty to sixty minute time slot. Just like in real life.  Television was the â€œplug-in drug.â€ And Americans were darn happy about it! It allowed us to ignore things like the Vietnam War, the changing roles of women, civil unrest, and Ringo Starrsâ€™ solo career.  Teachers would often scold that TV was making us into a nation of idiots. We ignored them and continued doing multiplication with our fingers. Ralph Nader warned us that TV was molding us into a unthinking nation of consumers. We scoffed at him and went right back to making out our Christmas lists. In September. Psychologists counseled us that TV was going to give us short attention spans.  Sorry. Where was I?  Oh yeah. TV movies. Unlike the 1980s, when every single madeâ€“forâ€“television film was about some mean disease disrupting some nice womanâ€™s perfect life, the networks of the 1970s made movies that entertained. You know, stuff that would make a viewer proud as a peacock!  Doesnâ€™t the following list of films just send you into a groovier, happier place: The Feminist and the Fuzz... Satan's School for Girls... The Ghost of Flight 401... Where Have All the People Gone?... Well, I could go on...  How about Nightmare in Badham County... Shark Kill... Cotton Candy... Sweet Hostage... Killdozer...  Want more? The Sex Symbol... Bad Ronald... Terror on the Beach... and the subject of todayâ€™s review Scream of the Wolf.  A made-for-TV werewolf movie? How can you go wrong? You canâ€™t -- especially when you have the winning team of Peter â€œMission Impossibleâ€ Graves, Dan â€œDark Shadowsâ€ Curtis, and Richard â€œTwilight Zoneâ€ Matheson on your side!  The film opens on a lonely, mist-shrouded country lane. Not in Transylvania, but somewhere almost as scary -- Northern California. In a really freaky pointâ€“ofâ€“view scene, a werewolf chases down its first victim -- a hapless salesman looking for a phone.  The next day. Cue 70s funk music with horns and that guitar that makes a sound like whichâ€“aâ€“choo whichâ€“aâ€“choo whichâ€“aâ€“choo. Cut to an arial shot of five police cars speeding down the road to the body of the victim and his demolished convertible.  I have a few observations to make about the (never named) townâ€™s ineffectual police force. The murder occurred late the previous evening. In this shot, the bright sunshine and direction of the shadows leads me to believe that it is obviously midday. Was it really necessary to risk life and limb racing down a serpentine mountain road with sirens blaring 12 hours after the murder occurred?  I can only surmise that speeding around and running the sirens makes this collection of Barney Fifeâ€™s feel like real Gâ€“men or something. Because there isnâ€™t a single shot, no matter how mundane, of police cars in the entire film when the sirens arenâ€™t yelping! My favorite example of this is when six cars and 1 highway patrolman shut down the entire street, pull into city hall, and walk inside to give a press conference. I pity the poor souls that work third shift in this town.  Another thing I noticed is that this tiny little town has a huge police force. One time I counted eight cars, a dozen uniformed officers, and numerous bloodhounds at the scene of a murder. Donâ€™t get me wrong -- Iâ€™m a big proponent of more police protection -- but property taxes must be awful.  But having a police force the size of Hannibalâ€™s army doesnâ€™t do the slow-witted sheriff any good. So he does what any good law enforcement official would do in his situation: he consults an expert, in this case â€œMr. Weatherbyâ€, a writer of wildlife books... Not to be confused with that other Mr. Weatherby, the rotund principal of Archie fame.  Sometimes the lead casting of a film is pure magic. Can you imagine anyone other than Clark Gable bringing Rhett Butler to life in Gone With The Wind? Or some hack actor like Ronald Reagan replacing Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine in Casablanca? I now proudly submit to this list Mr. Peter Graves for his groundbreaking role of Mr. Weatherby in Scream of the Wolf.  Alas, no one else could have brought such life and sparkle to lines such as:  â€œHave a little coffee.â€  and  â€œSure, come on!â€  Plus, heâ€™s so cool in this movie frost started to form on my television. He gets to drive a showy red sports car. He lives in a palatial bachelorâ€™s pad on a cliff by the Pacific Ocean. He even can ignore his girlfriend for weeks at a time and get back in her good graces just by flashing that winning smile of his. Did I mention that he gets to drive a showy red sports car?   Man, I wish I was Peter Graves.  Since bit players in horror movies stubbornly continue to put themselves at risk with the full knowledge that a killer is on the loose, more people die. My vote for best victim is the guy who goes walking down the same exact road as the first murder the very next evening. (I actually had to play that part of the DVD over to make sure that it wasnâ€™t intended to be a flashback.) Honorable mention goes to the couple making out in the trailer. Their approach to, uh, petting, seems to be wrestling around like bear cubs on an old blanket. And because this is a made-for-TV movie, the only item of clothing that is removed is their socks. You just canâ€™t make stuff like this up, folks.  Peter Graves points out to the police that the murdererâ€™s tracks always change from four footprints to two in a just few steps. Even though this information will have the average four-year old screaming at the screen, â€œItâ€™s a werewolf, people,â€ neither Peter Graves or the police make that connection.  But one person does make the connection: Peterâ€™s girlfriend played by Jo Ann â€œhowâ€“do-you-prounounce-my-last-nameâ€ Pflug. She pieces the whole mystery together and even spills the beans on the twist ending not only once, but TWICE in the first half of the movie. Look for those scenes and marvel.   Is Scream of the Wolf worth the four or five bucks the DVD will run you at a department store? Iâ€™d say yes. It isnâ€™t Citizen Kane, but it is a pleasant way to zone out for 78 minutes and delivers some fun shocks along the way. Even a dozen unresolved plot threads and a silly trick ending canâ€™t ruin it.  Anyway, have you looked at TV Guide lately? The best thing on tonight is Whatâ€™s Happening to My Knee? One Womanâ€™s Battle with Osgood-Schlacter's Syndrome of the Tibia Tuberal!          ",0

After visiting the Mormon Temple and driving near Columbine, Colorado last night, there is a whiff of weirdness in the air.

"523","4145578","indUnk","            Today was boring...nothing happend, not at all o.O  I slept really long (approx. 11 hours) but I was tired again soon. Don't know why...Am I short of sleep?? I really can't tell ...  Today, Teresa and I wanted to go to the Grottorailway. It's a little drive with a dragon-train and built for kids but it's too expensive. Since I'm over 14, it would cost me 4,40euro and that's too expensive right now.I told Teresa that and she can't afford that as well so we canceled the trip to the Poeslingberg. Maybe another time...  I dunno really know what to write but I'm bored so I want to have a little activity.  Sweetbox is so great O.O *is listening to Human Sacrifice* *adore* MOOOOOORE O____O  I hope my lastest Yesasia Order (MINMI - imagine, Twins - evolution, Chihiro Onitsuka - This Armor) arrives soon, maybe - with a lot of luck - this week but that would be too good to be true. Hope the 25th of August comes soon b/c I preordered Mika Nakashima's new DVD and it will release on this day and as good as I know myself I'll cancel the order more than one time and order again with another cd .... (Ordered Twins - Girlpower to pass the 49$ mark and get free-shipping) And I know I'm going to be concerned about money but I should always keep in mind that my birthday is on 30th of august. If my grandma ask what I want for birthday, I think I ask her if I can have the Mika DVD...One money-sorrow less ;)    I wanna be creative =/ I wanna paint a really beatiful picture, not only expressionless things...Hmpf...that sucks...I love art ...   Today I watched the first 2 episodes of CNN's new show 'Amish in th City'. It's really interesting if you ask me. 5 or 6 amish people - all around 22 - go to L.A. and live with 5 or 6 people from big cities. When the Amish are around 20 they are allowed to go away from the Amish-live to see - this sounds corny - the world. It's called 'Rumspringer'. They go to a city and see all those stuff they don't have and than they can decide if they wanna be an Armish for the rest of their life or wanna go away from it but I think that's kind of a hard desicion for them because if they decide to go away from the amish-life they hurt their family and stuff (I don't know much about this group...so please correct me if I'm wrong). I'm exiced what's going to happen in the next few episodes.  Aaaand I watched the two last episodes of 'The Simple Life 2'. lol, I think the whole show is stupid and senseless but since 'Gilmore Girls' ended in June (or July? o_O Don't know exactly...It's been ago too long ...) I had to look for another show and so I thought I could watch The Simple Life xD  Does anyone know 'Desperate Housewives'? loooooool, this show is SOOOO great but it's a pitty that there's only one episode :| ... That SUCKS ....    Okay, that's for today...Maybe tomorrow is more interesting than today..I wouldn't mind =/                      ",0
"524","4145578","indUnk","       Today I was thinking of my fav celebrities. I mean not only japanese singer. All.  I came to this decicion:   1. Ayumi Hamasaki & Julianne Moore  Ayumi, the greatest singer on earth. Her songs have so much power and I admire her for the point that she's writing her own lyrics. And Julianne Moore. I've NEVER seen such an gorgeous actress like she is. She plays her roles with so much feeling. Gosh, I love this 2 woman.   2. Mika Nakashima  Mika, my dearest Mika :)  She's such an gorgeous singer. When I list my fav singers, she's always on 1st position with Ayumi because her songs are so individual and beautiful.   3. Keanu Reeves & Robbie Williams  Keanu Reeves...yes...I haven't seen much movies with him. First of all I saw 'Matrix'. I thought he was good looking and playing well in this film but when I saw 'Sweet November', I saw a completely different face of him and of his talent. Keanu is great, no matter what. Robbie is  an AMAZING entertainer. He fits well with EVERY form of music. There aren't much of these musicians, they're really rar but Robbie is defentitly one of them. And I think he's hot. He has the little something.  I think that's it. I like a lot of celebs but those are the important one :)  Have I ever listed up my fav movies? oo (I'm in list up mood xD Sorry for that)   1. The Hours  I often mentioned it. It's just an great movie. I can't say why I love this movie...you have to see it yourself. It just kicks as in such a way !   2. The Shipping News  Only a few people know this movie...It's a great pity. This movie is just...wow. I was really impresed of it.   3. HERO  I NEVER saw a movie like that. Wow. I think the story itself of the movie is kinda sketchy but the dialogs and statments are so meaningful. And the beautiful colors. You should all see it !

"526","4142035","Student","       What's the big friggin' deal???  I've heard all kinds of arguments against gay marriage. A child needs both a father figure and a mother figure. Gays aren't able to love each other like straight folks, so they can't offer a child the same love a straight couple could. Marriage is a heterosexual institution, and them homos are edgin' in on our territory!!!  And my personal favorite: They're just getting married for the TAX BREAKS! What kind of freakin' idiot would dedicate him/herself to another individual and work to live out the rest of their days with them just to get a fucking tax break? The pay off is not worth the effort! Even the supposedly morally-devoid gay population of the world knows that. And if certain gay folks DO get married for the tax breaks, I doubt the validity of their existence.  When are people going to drop this? Here's my argument: Homosexuality isn't the problem. Marriage is. Marriage is a great example of government support of the crossing of church and state, which is a big no-no in America. And the religious ritual of marriage is encouraged by financial support from the state to the married. There are other ways to support people who want to have families or be married.  Derrick declares: from this day on, there will no more marriages! (note: not official law in the United States)     ",0

"528","4136438","indUnk","       Human trafficking is a problem that affects most of the countries today. It supports sex slavery, sweatshop slavery, official corruption, gang violence and terrorism. It is  urlLink a major problem in Israel , but it is likely more of a problem in many other places, such as  urlLink Finland .

In the US, following the 9/11 attacks various controversial measures, such as the much talked about USA Patriot Act were adopted.

And hence the question begs asking, why is the administration pushing through laws limiting its citizens' rights while at the same time not protecting the borders properly,- which is not only its right, but also one of its few original constitutional responsibilities from the very beginning, for if protection of borders is not part of 'common defense', I wouldn't know what is.

"529","4131984","Student","               I have officially become a nerd. I just spent 4 hours of my life reading some random guy's diary of his trip to Eurpoe. He had the coolest webpage and all his friends had cool weboages so i decided i want a cool webpage! I am always open to feedback.  Perhaps updating this thing (assuming I can figure out how it works) will keep me busy online.  I figured it out.  Today rehersal kind of sucked. Not for any real reason, it was just one of those long rehersals where not much gets done. All in all though I think that Pippin will be a really good show. I am just a player but I get to do a lot of fun dancing which really excites me. So far I am in the 'dance break' of Magic to Do, I have a trio dance with Amanda and Jen in the middle of Glory, and a pointe dance with Amanda, Claire, and Sam for With You. Not to mention the whole show is Fosse choreography, some of it original. Natalie lifted it right off the video. So all this dancing has been keeping me on my toes! hahaha that was a dumb pun, sorry.  I went to breakfast with my mom this morning at the Tumwater Valley Bar and Grill. It was quite enjoyable. Although, somethimes she is relaly judgemental about my friends. But I still love her. She starts her new job at TriWest tomorrow. I think she is really nervous that she will hate it. I keep telling her that she won't, and I really pray that she won't too. She only left her company so that she could live here and not in Sacramento because it was too damn hard to not live with her family. So I am really praying that she doesn't think that she has made a mistake by leaving HealthNet.  And I can't stop thinking about him. It sucks. Seriously. WHY! (At this precice moment I am contemplating whether or not I put this link in my profile, and whether or not that decision affects what I write.) Yes I think I will change the subject now, for fear of total rejection and humiliation. Not that he even has my screenname.  There are no longer kids at CTE, and I miss them already. Wow, hear I am trying to impact there life when they really have just changed mine. Its funny how much you can learn from kids when you are trying to teach them. Here are some funny kid quotes: 'Do you belive in Gawd? Gawd created all the aminals.' That was actually said to Joe but I love it. 'Caitlin! Make him turn around!' About 15 showcase girls refering to Rick and there obsession with him. 'You look sexy like that Caitlin' James in front of 120 Arts Fewstival kids. Way to go. By the way, I looked 'sexy' when I would put all of my hair in front of my eyes and put my sunglasses on. The kids loved it! Ahh, the simple joys. 'No way, my muscles are bigger!' A five year old boy named Blue, to another five year old boy named Adam. I could go on and on, but seeing that it is 1:36, I am tired. But I won't be able to sleep. Man, I need to buy more Tylenol PM. That will solve all my problems, not that I have any real problems.. at least I'm not in Sudan.  Oh! Also today, Richelle came over and we watched the first 5 episode of Season 4 of Sex in the City. Good show, good company, the good life.

"531","4128252","Education","   I have toyed with the idea of creating an online journal for a while now. Of course, I want to be somewhat creative, instead of just laying down all the complaints and whining that I seem to accumulate throughout my day. So, time will tell exactly what this blog will evolve into.  I read a cool quote in Wil Wheaton's new book 'Just a Geek', part of which was 'scream without raising your voice' from a song by U2 (hence the title of my page). Things have happened lately that have given me cause to reflect on that thought.  You have to understand, I am a big guy. I mean, like 6'2, 235lbs big. I have a deep voice and it...ummm...carries quiet well. Anyway, I can say just about anything and people think I am 'raising my voice' or 'yelling'.  I am also a High School Principal in a small Texas school. Now, I doubt that anyone has really warm, fuzzy memories of their school principal. Usually, we are the bad guys, the discipline givers and privilege takers away. Couple that fact with my stature and demeanor, and I sometimes get a label of 'abrupt and heavy handed'. Now, I have a great rapport with most all the students and teachers. They all know I have an open door policy and they can, and do, drop in any time. Moral is up, scores are good, discipline works and we are progressing in a very rapid fashion to being one of the top schools in the area.  However, apparently, a teacher that left ANOTHER FREAKING CAMPUS this summer had some 'issues' with me that, for the life of me, I can't connect her to me or to my campus at all. Anyway, she whined to the right people within the community, who whined to the right school board members in the community, who talked to the Superintendent, who, in turn called me in to tell me that everything was bad. I need to be hold teachers accountable, without hurting their feelings. I need to have discipline on campus, but I need to 'overlook' certain things and certain students. So, all the work I have done over the last several years and, especially over the last year, was completely invalidated.  Now, here is something people may not have figured out about me. I love what I do, I mean, I truly love it. I have never had another job that was so fun, fulfilling and motivating. I have a job where I get to take risks, I get to lead and I get to make a difference. I love it so much that I am willing to put up with the endless paperwork, the irrational and irritated parents and the apathetic teacher and/or student. I can even handle all the neverending criticism from people who should either try the job for a day or shut the hell up. Unless you know the job, you have no idea how to do the job.  Now, not only am I fighting a battle to maintain positive public relations with the community, but now I get to put on a horse and pony show for the 'Powers That Be', all of which have no idea what my job means or how tricky it is to establish a balance of stucture vs. comfort. Ah well, it will just be another challenge and another opportunity to 'grow as a person and as a professional'. This year I will 'cry without weeping, talk without speaking and scream without raising my voice'. See, now wasn't that positive??  O.K., so apparently I am going to whine a little within these hallowed halls. Sorry about that. I'll be a happier-go-luckier-blog-poster-er in days to come.  ",0

"533","4126109","indUnk","            5. Jay Schroeder 4. Rob Johnson 3. Tony Banks 2. Danny Wuerffel  1. Heath Shuler    First of all, let me say that I was at the game where Lawrence Taylor forcibly passed the torch from Joe Theisman to Jay Schroeder. I'm actually glad I was there and not watching it on TV, because there were no replays in the stadium. We had no clue how bad Theisman's injury was. We also had no clue that it was the beginning of an era of unsteadiness at quarterback for the Redskins.  Jay Schroeder (besides having a phonetically incorrect name...) was not good. He wasn't good with the Redskins. He wasn't good with the Raiders. He wasn't even a good baseball player (just ask the Toronto Blue Jays).  Rob Johnson has a target on his back. Or he smells like pork chops. I'm not sure which, but big defensive lineman start salivating when they see him in a game.   As much of a target as he is, at least he usually holds onto the ball.  Unlike....  Tony Banks has 73 fumbles in 89 games.  Are you kidding me?  This guy's in the NFL?  Danny, Danny, Danny.  Small hands.  Wears a glove.  Has an arm like a Girl Scout.  Must have incriminating photos of Steve Spurrier.  That's the only possible explanation I can see for the OBC continually turning to him.   And what is there to say about Heath Shuler that hasn't already been said?  The third overall pick in the 1994 draft, between Marshall Faulk and Willie McGinnist.  His career numbers:  49.2% completion percentage, 3691 yards, 15 TD,  33 INTs .  Wow.  He was worth every penny.              ",0
"534","4125935","indUnk","        watch Backdraft, or recall it.  No, no the sex scene on the firetruck, but when they'd open a door and that ball would burst through.   Yah that deadly and beautiful ball of fire.  Think about anything you've seen where an airplane door or window goes out way up in the air.  (think: Fight Club, U.S Marshals)   Think about it for a minute.  Think about the sound it makes.  The rush, the roar, the pulling you may feel.   Think about it.   Think about opening a heavy door against the wind.   I did something last night that I regret.  I had a curiosity that I did not want to ignore.  Not all curious urges need be acted on.  My life is an ongoing example of that fact.    I will not give details much.  That is not what maters.  Once again she is greiving for me, this grand firend of mine known fondly as 'Spirit Chick' (which reminds me she needs a new name as that one was given nearly 10 years ago when it was cool to be called a chick).  I wrote the account down in my journal, half asleep so I recalled not what I wrote until this morning when I read it.  I'm glad I did that, wrote in my sleep.  I was honest then, honest with myself.   In the Lion King, Mufasa appears in the clouds and tells Simba 'remember who you are.'  I have a hard time remembering how important it is that I remmber who I am and who I belong to.        To put things simply, I went on a 'ghost hunt' with some friends and with my love.   The place we went is well known in this area and beyond to those who belive in the spiritual things.  Troy Taylor thinks  it is a portal.   Who is Troy Taylor?  He writes books.  He has exspenive equipment.    urlLink http://www.prairieghosts.com   if you want to know.   My issue is not really as much what happened, but that it actually happened.    My spirit feels....raw.  Like it's been raped, or road rash or sunburn or all of the above.  Rape is more accurate.  I think that we experienced something last night that very few people ever have.   I can honestly say I have never been so terrified in my life.  Yes I've been scared.  Like the night I walked through the streets of Cuenca alone.  Or the time I had that spider on me, sticking it's web to my skin.   God doesn't leave me....I just get away.  Think of it like a little kid.......a little kid with its mama at the mall.  Mama doesn't leave the kid, kid wanders off.  It's happened to you...I know it has...you get surrounded by strangers, can't see mama.  You know how that feels, to look up and she's gone.           OK take all the sensory images I have given you....hold them in.   Don't call me crazy...believe this or don't.  But don't call me crazy if you don't believe.  Parallel to our puny pathtic vapor of a life on earth is the 'spirit world.'  I cannot speak for my 2 friends or my love when I say this.....you'll have to ask them.   But I really really really feel that last night, sitting in the back of my friend's Stang....that the door to their world flew open and they swarmed us like a swarm of bees.  I felt them all over me, pawing me in my very soul.  Like a little kid whose mama isn't left, just on the other side of these strangers.  The noise?  Like wind, laughing, screaming, grumbling, terror.  So, no more ghost hunts for me.  My mind is left with questions.......this is not the first time He's made me privy to that world.  Not the last.        at least I know Uncle George is NOT there.....        ",0

"551","4109616","indUnk","                 I have to apologize in advance to anyone who considers Bill Clinton their hero, because I just don't get it!  I was at Indigo at Bay and Bloor yesterday and there were people EVERYWHERE to get their copies of his book signed.  It was like he was a rock star!  There were helicopters hovering over the store.  Craziness.  And then today in the paper, there's a picture of him hugging this woman and all I could think was 'Well, there's a prime groping opportunity, Billy.'  I wonder if he DID grope her...now that woman can write a book if he did.  I believe that George W. Bush's unpopularity is linked to Bill Clinton's popularity.  Not that Clinton wasn't an all right President, but I didn't see him do anything amazing.  Of course, when I heard about Monica I couldn't bring myself to pay anymore attention to him anyway.  I'll never look at cigars the same way again.  And this post has officially taken a turn for the worse!   I got a great surprise at work today!  I entered a CSI trivia contest months ago and I finally got my prize pack today!  I got the new board game, some books and stuff and, the best part...a CSI maglight!

You see, I was only about a year old, first learning how to speak, how to walk, how to not bash my head into things when I crawl and look behind me at the same time, when I took a big trip.      Yup... a big trip.  Right down the stairs through the door and onto the kitchen floor.  One year olds can't walk.      Since that time, I have never been quite the same.  According to the TV, it is not normal for children to wear underwear on their heads and yell 'ZOOOOM' whilst they run through the house naked.  But I'm getting off topic, I didn't do that untili I was 21.       Ahem, yes, well... at one years of age, my first faceplant was not on a skateboard, nor was it much of a trick, nor was it very impressive, nor did it land me a girlfriend... nor...  oh you get it.

I found the humor to be uncreative and idiotic... attendance was less than fifty, and the majority were under 25... I can only assume that they knew some of the cast, as the entire  audience found the film to be uproariously funny!

My Top 5 Past Halloween Costumes    5.    Hula Girl  complete with grass skirt, scary Cher wig, and Flower Petals affixed to the boobs (thanks pasties, rubber cement, and Leah!)   4.  Bridget's  Gypsy  costume with the glittery gold see through pants.  I was decked out in this outfit one Bloomington evening at the Bluebird where a pretty well known IU basketball player said one and a half months post 9-11, 'Hey, heard of anymore terrorist attacks lately?'  My gypsy ass almost kneed him in the jewels for what was quite possibly the saddest and weirdest pickup line I've EVER heard.   3.  My mom went crazy with the fake blood and gauze, and I guess I was a cross between a  zombie  and a really ugly made-up fourth grader.  This costume/Halloween happened to coincide with the recent San Francisco earthquake, so I was staggering around with an Oakland A's baseball card wrapped in the gauze and I was saying I was a SF earthquake victim.  I'm surely going to Hell for that one.   2.  When I was seven or so, Mom sewed together the coolest  Minnie Mouse  costume, or was it Mickey?  Okay, so I looked part mouse, part mime, but I had so much fun doing my Mickey impersonation at every doorstep.   1.   Groucho Marx .

I don't know if it's the latest trend everywhere, but in the place where winter boots are least needed, Uggs are all the rage.  As soon as I say that, I'm sure they'll be deemed uncool, undeck even. ;)  I've seen them worn mainly with a short skirt, chubby legs, fake tan, and a gut.  Believe it or not, L.A. reminds me a lot of IU ; lots of large, spoiled, Fendi toting girls gabbing on their cell with one hand while shittily maneuvering out of their illegal parking spot right in front of the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf.  Who has the time to park, let alone find a metered street parking spot.  Besides, Daddy still pays for all of my parking tickets.  Ugg.  Wow.  I'm in a saucy mood today.  Maybe it's due to the pigeons that roam freely in this food court, nipping at my exposed toes under my stool.  I've never seen so many angry lunchgoers swatting and kicking the hell out of the little critters.  This table of women eating their taquitos let out the hugest yelps and belted the little pidgie in mid-air.  No, she didn't wash her hands after that.  Nequa didn't want her taquitos to get cold.  Have you seen Subway's attempt to become Atkins friendly?  They have a bacon cheddar mayo goo wrap and some other condiment/meat/cheese ridden wrap.  They look horrid.  They should call it the heart attack combo meal.  I'm still leery of the whole Atkins fad, and I think exercise, avoiding caffeine, drinking lots of water, and eating balanced meals is the way to go.  I'm not quite sure of the Wolfgang Puck Express that I'm sitting in front of.  Seems to me that the food was overhyped and overpriced to begin with, but now add the word 'express' to it, and it's the most expensive, bland, slowest fast food with a lot of attitude behind the cash register.  The tourists still come in droves, after all, it IS Wolfgang Puck.  A guy just wiped out while trying to stand on the first step of a descending escalator.  He was too enamored with his reflection in the porn mirrors that surround the area.  It's amazing how many people check themselves out upon stepping off the escalator up here, and it's not always the casual glance either.  So far we're averaging about 7 out of 10 random folks giving a deep stare at themselves.  I admit to doing the 'look' at clothing stores.  Put a mirror anywhere, and I think people subconsciously saunter over for a peek at how they're looking.  I can't finish my sandwich.  I think I'll give the rest to the pigeon who's currently trying to make meal out of my toenails.           ",0

It was with  Do You Kiss Your Mum With That Mouth  &amp; to be honest after Saturday I thought it was on the cards. Iâ€™d actually forgotten how blissful the afterglow is, how sweet that cigarette tastes. After the cuddles & stuff I went back to my room to get dressed. Once the door was firmly shut I silently exhaulted to myself. I imagine I must have looked like Stuart â€œpsychoâ€ Pearce after he scored that penalty in euro 96! Then I needed a tune. â€œLetâ€™s build a homeâ€ by The White Stripes (Listen to it &amp; youâ€™ll understand) was my choice & it was perfect. I am considering writing to my MP to see if it can be made law that all sexually active women have their tongues pierced.

"577","4071623","indUnk","               My First Juiced-Up Experience!  So last night I went and got â€œjuiced upâ€. I have to say this is my first time and I found that I was alittle lost.  I mean good grief they have nicknames for the Starbucks staff. As I was sitting back and listening to everyone talk I decided that maybe I should share what I learned last night, that way you wonâ€™t be so lost when you go and get â€œjuiced upâ€.  Since Iâ€™m real good with list I thought a top 10 list would be appropriate. Remember this is all stuff that I learned last night while sitting at Starbucks for an hour and half with these people.   10. Thereâ€™s a girl staff and guy staff. Last night we had the girl staff plus one guy. 9.   There seems to be two favorite Starbucks employees among the group. First thereâ€™s Starbucks Sarah and then thereâ€™s Smokie Smokerson. I had the pleasure of seeing both girls last night. 8. Smokie Smokerson seemed nice and looks pretty normal. She got the nickname because every time she has a break sheâ€™s always looking for an ash tray. I was also told she has a boyfriend that picks her up from work and he wears a white hateâ€¦they like to call him White Hat Guy. Grant described the hat as a beret type hat, but not! (whatever that means) 7. Starbucks Sarah is the gothic looking girl. She actually talked to us while she was taking down the umbrellas and seemed pretty nice. I think she also gave Ken a drink on the house. We tried to get Ken to go flirt with her but he wouldnâ€™t. 6. Stalkersâ€¦ as I sat there last night I realized that I was with a bunch of stalkers. They all know so much about the people that regularly visit Starbucks and they really donâ€™t talk to themâ€¦.I was getting alittle worried and creeped out at the same time. 6. Grantâ€™s Girl. She did NOT show up to Starbucks last night!  If you donâ€™t know Grant thinks this girl that wears glasses and a sweater is kinda cute. I do want to add that Grant is NOT stalking the girlâ€¦.Rosey is. Rosey knows everything about herâ€¦well ok not everything, but she sure knows alot for never talking to her. 5. This group goes to Starbucks way too much! When Grantâ€™s order was ready they said â€œGrant your orders ready.â€  That was the big time for this group! 4. Starbucks gives free water. I know thatâ€™s not interesting but hey itâ€™s good info to know! 3. Grantâ€™s Girl again. I just would like to add that this group knows what time she normally visits Starbucks.

To tell the truth it was not so good as I had expected, but still not bad for aspiring. As always this kind of movies made me think of a lot of things, such as the passion of making a band I used to have and the days I was learning guitar. Somehow later I quitted. I guess I really didnâ€™t have enough patience to learn such 6-string thing. Maybe I should have started doing it when I was younger not now when itâ€™s all too late. Well but I still love music.

"581","4063812","Sports-Recreation","             Pedro Martinez is now the heart and soul of the Boston Red Sox.  Such a bold statement can be made because his biggest competition, Nomar Garciaparra, was dealt to the Cubs several weeks ago.  Along with this trade came lots of accusations and insults tossed back and forth between Nomar and Red Sox management.  The Nation became split on the Nomar issue, and this allowed Pedro to become the number one player in the hearts and minds of Sox fans.  Pedro is held in such high esteem because of his phenomenal results throughout his career.  This is especially true when looking back at his magical run from 1998-2000.  In that three-5year period there was no better pitcher on the planet, and some would argue that it was the most dominant stretch by any pitcher in history.  To illustrate this point, here are his averages in those seasons:  20 wins, 30 starts, 5 complete games, .778 win %, 221 1/3 innings pitched, 11.55 K/9, 7.03 K/BB, 2.23 ERA, .196 AVG against, .543 OPS against  With Martinez virtually unstoppable through all this, Red Sox fans were ecstatic.  The feeling was that you were witnessing pitching history every 5 days.  Then in 2001, it all changed in a big hurry.  Pedro was diagnosed with a frayed rotator cuff and he was done for the season.  Martinez elected to rehab the injury instead of having it surgically repaired, and worried Sox fans wondered if heâ€™d ever be the same.  In the two full seasons since then, the team was very cautious with the use of Pedro.  It seemed as though 100 pitches became his new limit, and he was given an extra day of rest whenever possible.  Pedro was still good, but not the amazing fireballer he was before the injury.   As time went on we saw him rely more and more on his breaking pitches and less on his upper 90s fastball.  In the current season, Pedro only reaches the mid-90s a few times a game and for the most part they top out at 94 mph.   Martinez was forced to evolve as a pitcher but the results were still fairly close to his career numbers.   With that said, the only nagging question was his durability.  In  2002-2003, Pedro averaged about the same number of starts as he did before getting hurt but there was a big drop in his innings average.  He pitched approximately 13% less, which is close to one inning per start.  In the eyes of many, that was a big problem.  People couldnâ€™t see the value in having an ace that had a hard time making it to the 7th inning when his salary kept escalating: $13.5 million (2002), $15 million (2003), and $17.5 million (2004).  So Pedro came to spring training this season and added more dark clouds to a murky sky.  His velocity was barely hitting 90 mph, and he was getting knocked around in almost all of his starts.  Even before the first game of the season, the hot question for the Red Sox was â€œWhatâ€™s wrong with Pedro?â€  The fans and media wanted to know if we were going to see enough innings and pitches to make his record salary for a pitcher worthwhile.  Would we see the 6 1/3 inning Pedro who hadnâ€™t reached the standard 200 IP in the previous two years, or could it be possible that we might once again have the workhorse who regularly went 7+?  From the start it looked like we were going to get the former and not the latter.  And then a funny thing happened.  Martinez spoke candidly with the media about the fact that team doctors told him his arm wouldnâ€™t be at its post-injury peak until three years after the initial problem.  That statement, coupled with the weather warming up around the league, seemed to be the jumping off point for Pedroâ€™s season.  His fastball was back up to where it had been the previous couple of years, and it seemed like maybe the fragile Pedro was gone and the Pedro of old was back!  Before we get our hopes up, letâ€™s take a look at how Martinez has fared so far this season.  Through August 17th, Pedro has made 25 starts without missing a single one.  Assuming the rotation stays the same the rest of the way, Martinez should make 8 more starts.  If the Red Sox make the playoffs (which is a distinct possibility since my glass is always half full), then he will probably not make his last start to be saved for the ALDS.  With that in mind, weâ€™ll say he makes 7 more starts.  That would give him 32 starts for the season, which is one less than his career high.  At the same time, Martinez has also pitched 166 2/3 innings, for an average of 6 2/3 per start.  Projecting that out through 7 more starts would give a total of 213 1/3 innings pitched on the year, which would put him just below his career average (by about 5 innings).  Based on all this, which Pedro do we have this year?  Optimists will see that he should eclipse the standard 200 IP plateau for the first time since his injury.  Theyâ€™ll also mention that barring any freak injury he wonâ€™t miss a single start.  This makes you start to think that the Pedro of old could be back!  On the other hand, there is the fact that Martinez is averaging 12 less pitches per start in the three years after he got hurt than the three before.  Plus, his IP/start this year is still pretty much the same it has been the past two seasons (6.67 versus 6.54).  This would make some people say that itâ€™s still the same new and not so improved Pedro.  Otherwise, Martinez has been fairly consistent from 1998-2004 in several other important pitching statistics, most notably his AVG/OBPSLG/OPS against.  His K/9 and K/BB are down slightly, but that is attributed to points that were made earlier about him not being as much of a power pitcher anymore.  His ERA the past two years were microscopic as always, but this year itâ€™s a little high due to a couple of early season beatings he took.  With all the information above it looks like we have a new and different Pedroâ€¦you could say that he is middle-ground Pedro.  Heâ€™s taken some of the attributes from each â€œhalfâ€ of his career and combined them this season.  He can now be counted on to pitch regularly and dominantly, but not as deep into games as he had in the past.  Is this Pedro worth the money heâ€™s being paid this year?  Not quite, but if the Sox can sign him for $12-$13 million for the next few years then middle-ground Pedro is good enough for me!  Realistically, this still keeps him in the upper echelon of starting pitchers in the league.  There are still only a handful of pitchers who can match Pedroâ€™s skillâ€¦even if he isnâ€™t quite the same as he used to be.

"592","4046696","Communications-Media","        This morning I was awoken by the sound of pumped-up-to-the-max   urlLink  Klezmer    music. Evidently the teachers at the yeshiva elementary school across the street, which is run by the Belz   urlLink  hasidim   , had decided to give the kiddies (who, it seems, do not get a summer vacation) a morning of dancing in the playground. There they were, dressed in collared shirts buttoned to the top and tucked into dark trousers that were belted under their armpits, long sidecurls and ritual fringes bouncing as they danced wildly. The corpulent, bearded, black-clad rabbis surveyed them indulgently, no doubt as glad as their charges to have a break from the classroom.  At first it was charming, in an atavistic sort of way. I padded around my apartment barefoot, humming to vaguely familiar melodies with lyrics that varied between yai dai dai and cheeri bim cheeri bam. But after an hour I was clutching my head. Oy vey! Please, let it stop! It's too hot for all this noise!  I was saved by the  alte sachen  man.  Several times each week, an Arab guy from Jaffa appears in my neighbourhood, riding a horse-drawn cart and shouting repeatedly  in Yiddish,  'alte sachen' (old things). People lean out their windows and call out for him to come and take away their leaking refrigerators, broken-down furniture and worn-out clothes. Presumably, he sells the stuff somewhere. But why does the Arab junk collector call out in Yiddish? My theory is that the original Tel Aviv junk collectors were Yiddish-speaking Jews from Eastern Europe, and the cry 'alte sachen' became a sort of trademark.  Anyways, the kids at the Belz yeshiva, who do speak Yiddish,  love  the alte sachen man. As soon as they hear his cry they rush to the schoolyard gate and press their faces between the bars as they shriek out 'alte sachen! alte sachen!' For kids who spend at least 8 hours per day in the classroom from the age of 4, and who aren't allowed access to television, cinema, secular literature or the physical outlet of sports, I guess this is a major source of entertainment.  So they were distracted from the klezmer music, and the rabbis, I guess, didn't see any point in continuing. They went back to the classroom and I had some peace and quiet.

"593","4046247","Student","        As of late this morning, we understand that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has overwhelmingly won a critical referendum on the continuation of his rule. The result of this referendum, which the OAS and the Carter Center appear to be in the process of certifying as free and fair, must be respected, so long as it is clear and evident that Mr. Chavez leads Venezuela by the mandate of the Venezuelan people.       Mr. Chavez is the dreaded enfant terrible of the Venezuelan upper class, a combination of populist and revolutionary. His mission involves removing the elite from positions of economic power and influence throughout the country, and using the state oil company, PEDEVESA, Petroleos de Venezuela, to fund expanisve social programs.       We can debate the good and bad points of the Chavez regime all day long. It has its positive aspects. Clearly, Chavez has done more to lift the Venezuelan people out of poverty than his incredibly corrupt predecessors, like Rafael Caldera and Carlos Andres Perez. I couldn't see either of those two leaders making a sincere attempt at doing anything to alleviate the misery that stalks much of the nation, which, like Nigeria, its African counterpart in OPEC, has learned the difficult lesson that oil is, as an analyst in  Foreign Affairs  put it years ago, a curse for developing countries, a reinforcer of social stratification and an invitation to waste and massive spending on vain infrastructural superprojects and unnecessary military equipment. The elite in Venezuela, much like the elite throughout Latin America, have in Hugo Chavez the leader that they deserve; his Bolivarian Revolution is an answer to their oppression of centuries, to their historic rape of the land, the Indians, and the African slaves, and to their right wing dictatorships and their flimsy, oligarchic democracies. If the Panamanians have a saying, that  'cada pueblo tiene el gobierno que merece ' (each people has the government it deserves), it applies to some of those Venezuelans today who stomp and who cry, as they witness the dislocations at PEDEVESA and elsewhere, engineered by the Bolivarian leader.       My friend Nadia Buchai, whose Ukrainian Orthodox Church I am looking forward to attending, tells me that when she was in Venezuela, there often were electrical blackouts. Imagine that: electrical blackouts in an oil rich land! And why? Because, according to Nadia, the rich in Venezuela believed it to be beneath them to pay electricity and water bills. Noblesse disobliged.      Such anecdotes, as well as first hand experience of how wealthy  criollo  whites throughout Latin America treat and refer to 'the Indians,' do much to explain 'Chavismo' to me, by casting Chavez's social programs in a specific social and historical context, itself imprinted in my conscience.      Now, I do not idealize Chavez. He holds the dubious and stupid distinction of being the only world leader to visit Saddam Hussein after the Persian Gulf War. His massive spending, touched off by the high price of oil and responsible for some of the referendum votes in his favor, reminds one of the enormous superprojects embarked upon by Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo (1976-1982), who believed that massive oil deposits discovered off the coast of the state of Campeche, in the Gulf of Mexico, would provide the funds to purchase Mexico's pathway to prosperity.  Once the price of oil declined, Mexico set off an international wave of default on foreign debt that ruined the country and left many destitute, with no choice but to emigrate!!!        Yet Chavez was elected democratically, and now that his election has been reaffirmed, the opposition must respect the results. There should be no emulation of Pedro Carmona's briefly successful 2002 officer's coup.    Both sides need to bring some civility to the table of Venezuelan political dialogue.      President Bush should cooperate with Chavez. Venezuela sends us 1.5 million barrels of oil daily.     The two are at opposite ideological poles, and the Bush Administration has traditionally taken a haughty attitude toward Latin governments that are not pliant (I'm thinking of the record of former Bush adviser Otto Reich, as well as of statements made by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, who told the Brazilians that they could trade with Antarctica if they did not support the FTAA). Statements made by Ari Fleischer during the unfolding of the Carmona coup, which intimated (and was widely interpreted as intimating) support for the coup plotters, damaged Bush's credibility in Venezuela and the surrounding region.

Speaking of going back to school, I'm so glad I'm out of here in a few weeks.&nbsp; I'm not being given any large scale, long term projects to work on at this time for obvious reasons, but just got called upon to help complete the writing of a training manual for a system I know nothing about.&nbsp; Talk about the blind leading the blind.&nbsp; Oh well, it's a paycheck for the rest of my time here.&nbsp; What will drive me crazy before my end here is this chick with the loudass mouth in the office next to mine.&nbsp; Shut the hell up already.&nbsp; She reminds me of MiMi on the Drew Carey show, except her blue eye shadow isn't quite as dramatic as MiMi's and her hair is brown.&nbsp; I can't concentrate effectively with her running her trap non-stop.&nbsp; Actually, speaking of the office, we have quite a mix of people in our department.&nbsp; There's Mimi the loud mouth, there's Petunia the Pig (looks just like Petunia in human form),&nbsp; Marge Simpson's twin sister's missing triplet, complete with bad attitude, cheap cigarettes, fried hair and raspy voice, the 5th Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (again, looks just like a Ninja Turtle personified, his skin even looks green), and Jaba the Hut.&nbsp; Where are all the pretty people?&nbsp; Help!  I go to the oral surgeon today for a consult on my wisdom teeth.&nbsp; I'm actually amazed I kept up with my referral form this long (nearly a month!) without losing it.&nbsp; I believe that calls for a celebratory ice cream.&nbsp; Maybe not.&nbsp; I'm kind of skeered of going to the surgeon today.&nbsp; They're not even going to be doing anything today and already I feel a big knot in my stomach.&nbsp; Oh well, worse things have happened.

"599","4035457","indUnk","                 I now have a greater sense of admiration for web designers.  Yesterday was the third day at my temporary summer job. I work for one of the departments at my school. During summer most of the student employees are unavailable, and a skeleton crew runs this office, which is usually not a big problem. They're busy, but they can handle it. However, this year the staff realized that, in addition to their usual duties, they had to update their website. For some reason the university decided to change servers (or something like that), and all the departments have to migrate alllllllll the information from their existing, respective websites, to the new one. Every link, every picture and graphic, must move. Here's where I come in.   Rather than hire a professional and pay them up the ass per hour, they hired lil' ol' me to do the job for less pay. Still, the Fates were smiling down on me as this job was basically served to me on a platter. Fortunately I have a little experience with web design, fortunately I was starving for a job, and fortunately I was on campus.  So I've spent the past 3 weekdays migrating all the stuff from one place to the other, making sure the links work, etc. Then they tell me I also have to update the site, which meant making brand spanking new pages and adding more photos. I never realized how tedious such a job was. I spent most of Monday creating new icons. I spent all of Tuesday cropping photos to make sure they fit exactly right on the page. Yesterday I started redesigning the home page- not an easy task. Today...I don't know yet. I do know that my mouse hand and wrist hurts and I have a headache everyday (though this may also be due to my contacts). I worry I might get carpal tunnel, but I can't stop working. It's amazing that my eyes and right wrist still have enough strength to write for this blog regularly.  To think what I'm doing is small potatoes compared to what real web designers do. How do you guys do it without givng yourselves carpal tunnel? DO you have carpal tunnel? How do you combat it?  I had no idea how tough and tedious it can be to design a site. I have to give you all props *salute*.         urlLink Read more!       ",0
"600","4034739","indUnk","   ....nah!  I'm a bad girl.  Sweetie thinks I'm an exhibitionist.  I don't know if I am just totally immodest (a tramp) or if he is a complete prude.  I think he is such a huge perv that goes peeking in other people's windows and he can't imagine that the rest of the world isn't just like him.  Perhaps I just don't give a shit about the rest of the world's hang-ups about the human body. It's not like I'm walking naked to get the mail.  I always make sure I'm covered when I step outside and if I want to walk around the house naked I close all the blinds.  I cannot be naked on the stairs because there is a huge window with no treatments but the only ones who could see in that window would be our neighbors across the street, with binoculars.    I've checked.   Not really but I do remain covered on the stairs.    It's our bedroom windows that concern him.  Our room is hot and I am always warm anyway.  So I like to be naked in my room and have the windows open a little.  I keep the blinds down low enough that no one could see me without being on a ladder or stilts right outside my window.   I just don't think I am blatant enough that anyone is going to notice me sitting naked by my window and I don't think that everyone else in the neighborhood is all that interested in getting a look at me.  And it might be a big  boost to my ego except I know him better than that.  ",0

"602","4033906","Government","                 During my childhood, a majority of my friends parents (referred to as Yardbirds) worked for Puget Sound Naval Shipyard (PSNS).&nbsp; These kids were often teased due to what their parents did for an occupation, which included such jobs as welders, pipefitters, shipfitters, and riggers.&nbsp; I too joined in the bantering because their parents would come home from work filthy and smelled of diesel fuel and oil.&nbsp; Their faces were smudged with grease and had calluses covering both their hands and feet (steel-toed boots are not 'feet friendly').&nbsp; They had bad hair-dos, wore overalls, and flannel shirts.&nbsp; Never in my wildest dreams would I have succumbed to such an occupation, or so I thought.   I remember my father having me and all my sisters take the test to join the shipyard's Apprenticeship Program back when I was 18 years old.&nbsp; My one sister, who was a single-mom of two children, jumped&nbsp;at the chance, my other sister and I were urged to, which we did with reluctance.&nbsp; A couple weeks after the testing was completed we all got our letters that my father was impatiently waiting for.&nbsp; My oldest sister scored the highest (102% with 10 extra points added for being a disabled veteran), my middle sister failed to no one's surprise since she was asking us what a fraction was the night before the test, and I passed with decent scores (86% with 70% being passing).&nbsp; After you receive these scores, you submit them to the different shops of the yard that you desire to enter.&nbsp; My eldest submitted to all of them, my other couldn't submit at all, and I told my father 'I not doing it, I'll NEVER be a shipyard worker', which was the end, or so I thought, of the whole thing.   Funny enough, seven years later with a few low-paying crappy jobs under my belt, I re-applied.&nbsp; I was eight months pregnant and the application administrators looked at me as if I were insane, but I knew the process took a long time and the window of opportunity was now.&nbsp; After seeing my sister (still a single mom) purchase a home, buy a new car, and live well with barely a child-support check, I was all for taking another look at the shipyard.   I re-took the test, receiving a 97%.&nbsp; This really helped.&nbsp; I had my choice of 12 different careers to choose from.&nbsp; Why did I pick rigging?&nbsp; It was a new field for women at the yard.&nbsp; The Rigging shop was the last of a dying breed of 'Men Only' type occupations.&nbsp; The men who interviewed me told me that with the aid of mechanical advantage (i.e. chainfalls, shackles, air hoists, cranes, winches) anyone could lift anything.&nbsp; Both breaking ground on a new field for women, as well as moving the impossible interested me enough to make it my top choice.&nbsp; A few weeks later, I got the call.&nbsp; Apparently, they chose me as well.&nbsp; Along with 11 other people I became part of the&nbsp;Class of 1999 Rigger Apprenticeship at Puget Sound Naval shipyard.&nbsp; So, there I was, the mother of a beautiful 16-week old son and the 19th woman to become a Rigger at PSNS.  Boy, was I in for an eye-opening experience...               ",0
"603","4031020","Marketing","   Weight: 290  Food: I don't even want to GO there.  I always seem to have my most poignant revelations after I've eaten an insanely huge meal. It's also very easy to promise myself all the things I'm going to change when my stomach is full. When I'm hungry, I could care less about changing my life -  I just want to eat .  I don't hate thin people. I also don't admire them. I truly think people are just people, and everyone has their quirks. I have to admit though, that sometimes I wish my 'quirk' wasn't so damn visible. I mean, you've got your anorexics, your alcoholics, your nymphomaniacs, your drug addicts and your fattys. For the most part, these people can pretty much hide their problems and either work them through personally or literally kill themselves over it.  Except the fattys.  No, we have to not only eat ourselves miserably into oblivion, but the whole damn world knows it. And then the world makes fun of us for it. Even Paris Hilton would have to admit that sucks. Except she doesn't know what it feels like so she could probably care less. Hell, I could care less about her problems, so who can blame her?  I walk around every day advertising that I have a problem. So what do I go and do? I start a blog, so I can talk about my own big fat ass. What a genius thing to do.  Actually, jokes aside, the point of this blog is to help put my weight back in my face. A few years ago, I moved to a separate city after graduating from college. A year and a half after starting my first job, I started losing a bunch of weight. I started out at 263 lbs., and then I lost 55 of them. Yep, I held steady right around 208, and I stayed there for a while, waiting for my next 'losing spurt' because it happens in cycles of determination. Actually, even at 208 I was quite fit. You could see my abs, I was in a size 18, which is just 4 sizes larger than the average woman, and I could run a few miles per day. I was large, but NO ONE would guess that I was over 200 simply because my level of fitness was so high.  Then my dad got sick and I moved back to Chattanooga to run the family business. My hometown.  The city that made me want to eat in the first place because all my problems started here.     It was a good decision. I think I accomplished what I set out to do. My father died, and I was here for my family when it happened. But here it is, exactly 2 years and 6 weeks after I moved back home. Not only did I eat my 55 lbs. back, but I added 29 more. The fog is lifting and realizing what I did to myself is very devastating.  That's why I'm more determined than ever to beat this thing. As you can see from the first week, I'm a serious creature of habit, and it's very hard for me to change my patterns.  But once I do, there's no turning back.  I did it before.  I can do it again .  In my heart, I know I've already won this battle. But the journey is the fun part, so I hope you can join me.  ",0

"606","4022928","indUnk","              I know what I forgot to tell you yesterday. The most pervasive symptom of all â€“ fatigue.  If you donâ€™t suffer from it you donâ€™t know what it is. Iâ€™m sorry, but itâ€™s true. I tell people my fatigue is up and they tell me how tired they are too. Not even close. I can have a great nightâ€™s sleep and wake up barely able to move because of fatigue. Iâ€™ll feel fine. But my body wonâ€™t agree.  Letâ€™s see. Think of the day you were the most tired in your life, completely exhausted. Now multiple it by about 100 or so, now youâ€™re coming closer. Still itâ€™s different. My muscles want to respond but they canâ€™t. Just... canâ€™t. Now apply that to other things like breathing and youâ€™ll start to get the idea.  MS does this to you. Medication can too. Thatâ€™s my problem at the moment. The drug I take for the TN is up a substantial amount and its biggest side effect in me is fatigue. Itâ€™s been a frustrating few days. Guess thatâ€™s why I started this really. Writing always gives me focus. By the time this gets out to you Iâ€™ve worked and reworked it and cleared my head (mostly.)  So today was really going to be about my kids. Theyâ€™re 19 (girl) and 16 (boy) and weâ€™ve been through a lot together. Take the â€˜typicalâ€™ teenager, compound it by adding a divorce and then toss in MS. I wonâ€™t sugar coat any of it. It was hell on wheels for a while. My daughter went through the usual mom hating stint multipled by some insane factor and her denial for the first year or two of my MS.  I canâ€™t say which kid it was harder on. They approached it so differently.  For my daughter the MS was rough because weâ€™d done everything together for all of her life, including Girl Scouts â€“ you know, hiking, camping, cookie sales. Iâ€™d been healthy and active and that changed very quickly. Add to this, I was diagnosed the same year her dad and I divorced and she hit her teens full blast â€“ hormones and all, and she was a terror. Things got worse for a few years and I wasnâ€™t sure we would survive it. And then she grew up. Youâ€™d be proud to know her, I know I am. And one of the nice side effects (yes, there are good ones, just usually not with medication) is that sheâ€™s become active in my healthcare. Itâ€™s been hard for her at school and out of state. But when sheâ€™s home, she goes to the doctor with me and my tests when she can. She wants to know all the details and to be a part of my support system. We talk. We talk a lot about everything. I love that we're friends again.  My son took it all differently. He was young and angry with his dad, so he became my protector. It was sweet but worried me some. I didnâ€™t want him to not be a kid cuz he felt I needed help. Six years ago this was all adjustment. A diagnosis without any idea of what it really meant. What that caring has done is to make him a strong and compassionate young man. Now, he wants to know whatâ€™s going on, but less is more, he doesnâ€™t need all the details unless theyâ€™re important to know, like what my meds are and their dosages. Heâ€™s gone a lot of the time. Heâ€™s 16, what do you expect?! And getting him to help around the house is like pulling teeth. But he makes sure I know where he is (usually) and when Iâ€™m really bad he pops in every now and then to check on me. Heâ€™ll be around more once school starts as his sister will be gone again. They seemed to have worked it out between them. I donâ€™t think they talk about it much. I know they worry a lot.  I try to be strong for them, but Iâ€™ve learned that itâ€™s ok to have a bad day, to cry, to be frustrated or scared. That was hard to accept for myself. But sometimes Iâ€™ll walk in the door and just sit down and cry. One or the other or both will come and just sit with me, put their arms around me and be still. God, how did I get so lucky? That's not to say we donâ€™t have our moments. But theyâ€™re normal (is there any such thing?) teenage moments, not 'Oh my God, my mom has MS' moments.      We constantly learn new ways to make things work. We talk. In truth, I think that having MS has helped to keep communication open through these years where so many families struggle.           ",0

Or  even this:    But then I see this:   And at first glance I'm thinking, a coffin? For a kid's birthday?  What would you write on top?   'Here's to one more year closer to DEATH Timmy!'  'Life's a bitch and then you die kid!'  'Pretty soon you'll have one foot in the grave. Enjoy it while it lasts!'  What the hell? Then I noticed that the caption for the cake said it was a treasure chest. And I'm soooooooooooo relieved!    ",0

"620","4004835","indUnk","       I was doing a little research into Gus Triandos, and I came across this blockbuster trade that went down on 11/18/1954 between the Orioles (who had just finished their first season since moving from St. Louis) and the New York Yankees.  The Orioles traded Bob Turley, Don Larsen (who pitched a perfect game for the Yankees in the 1956 World Series), Billy Hunter, Mike Blyzka, Darrell Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski for Gus Triandos, Willy Miranda, Gene Woodling, Harry Byrd, Jim McDonald, Hal Smith, Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert and Ted del Guercio.  This was an important trade because it brought a lot of new blood into the Orioles franchise and helped the team to establish its own identity.     ",0

"623","3993110","indUnk","       Heather, Leana, Chris, Amy, Fitz and I played Texas Hold 'em on Saturday night. Amy and I are terribly similar. Our attention span is, oh, 15 minutes long. I can usually hold out a little longer, but Men's gymnastics was on NBC for the Olympics, and I just dropped all my candy in the pot and went to the living room to watch. We play with Starbursts and Hershey's miniatures. I found it rather difficult to play with Leana, because she is lactose intolerant, which means she can't eat chocolate. So she kept betting away all her Hershey's and her Reese's because she couldn't eat them. We didn't know if she was betting because she had a good hand or because she could eat the chocolate. Eventually Fitzy took it all. We took home a big bag of candy, and I ate it until I thought I was going to be sick.  So I started working out again last week. I have read, and I believe it is true, that it is easier to stay motivated if you have a goal. So I thought I would get on a plan to train for a tiathlon. I found a 21 week program online. So I started training last week. And by training I mean running. And by running, I mean walking. My husband is very sweet and walks with me, even though my legs are about half the length of his and if he walks at my pace, he's is barely doing more than standing still. But, it is still sweet.

Here's some facts about hornets/wasps: Like bumblebees, the wasp colony dies in winter and the newly mated queens hibernate. In spring, the queen builds a nest, made from 'paper' composed of chewed wood fibres, in hollow trees, roof spaces, compost heaps etc. Larvae are fed on insects. In summer, wasps seek out sources of sugar and can become a nuisance especially at picnics. Wasps can sting and will defend their nests with vigour.   In several hornet species, no workers are produced. Instead the female lays its eggs in the nests of other wasps, where the eggs hatch and the young are fed.&nbsp;&nbsp;   However, wasps are beneficial - one worker wasp can collect over 100 aphids in one day.   100 aphids!

"628","3984529","indUnk","             (On a lighter note this time...)  I've been fortunate to associate over the last few weeks with two puppies.  One is a 10-11 month old Chihuahua that my neighbours/owners of the house where I live just got for their six-year old son.  His name is Knuckles (and you have to ask the six-year old, Dylan what the name represents), and the other, when I met him two weeks ago, was a five-week old cocker spaniel, Samba.  For those who know me, you know how much I love dogs.  Puppies melt my heart immediately, espeically when they are friendly, and lick me, and these two tend to do that whenever they see me.  I see Knucles almost every day.  He is quite self-possessed, but being a puppy, and having been rescued from a less-than-ideal environment, was cautious the first day.  Since then, we've been 'kissing cousins.'  He always runs up to me, lets me scratch him, and licks me wherever he can reach.  I usually get down as low as I can so he can lick my face.  I mean, hey, if I don't have a man doing it, I might as well get the love from the puppy, right?  Well, Knuckles has two housemates of the four-legged variety, an elder border collie, Pasha, and a cat called Barry (we still haven't decided if he was named after Barry White or Barry Manilow, and probably never will: this was another example of Dylan's naming).  My relationship with Pasha has been a cool one: she is very protective of her owner (Melodie), and usually barks when I approach Melodie or another member of her family; however, when she is in the yard by herself, she is perfectly content to let me walk around on 'her' territory.  Yesterday things changed slightly.  As she saw Knucles rolling toward me (he's still having trouble walking gracefully, which is endearing in itself), she tried to run interference, and push him away.  Knuckles ignored her and continued his approach, I got my kisses, and Pasha, seeing that I am a friend of dogs (but not of Barry), even gave me a couple of licks of her own.  Samba is someone I only get to see during class.  His owner, Regia, brings him to class, and he sometimes runs around the lecture hall, always making sure to at least say 'hello' to me.  Last night during class, even the instructor was playing with him while lecturing.  Eventually, when Samba rolled up (his paw coordination is just not there, and that makes him even cuter, if you can imagine!), and insisted on lots of scratching.  Since I was bending down to scratch him, I thought I'd make both of us comfortable.  I took him in my lap, where he proceeded to give me lots of kisses, and then decided that I make a great chew toy for his little growing teeth.  For those who haven't seen me over the last couple of months, I've gotten my second ear pierced, and had the first piercing (in the other ear) widened.  I am wearing these little hoops with metal balls.  So, Samba went to town, alternating licking my ear (once more, if I can't have a boyfriend do it, why not Samba, right?), and chewing on the earring.  Then he decided that the earring and the ear lobe just weren't enough.  He transferred the chewing to my nose.  With teeth as small as his, it's not painful at all, and I was perfectly content to listen to the lecture while Samba climed all over me, chewed my nose and licked my face.  He was adorable.  I always notice dogs, and (in those rare instances) when I walk around the neighbourhood, I make sure to at least compliment the dog owners when I meet them, and greet the dogs in a non-threatening manner.  I guess they can recognize that I love them, and they've always treated me well.  I think when I get sufficiently well to go looking for work, and still have free time on my hands, I might consider owning a dog again.  My last dog, Tony, was a joy from the moment we picked him up from the breeder when he was six weeks old, and throughout his fourteen year life.  At times, when I was feeling particularly sad or depressed, he would sense it, and spend as much time with me as he could.  My parents' current dog, Duke, who looks very much like Tony, has also fallen head over heals in love with me, and doesn't let my parents approach me until he gets his greetings in.  Maybe the reason I like guys who are a bit younger and small-framed, with big puppy eyes and long eye-lashes goes back to my feeling for puppies.  I've dated a number of guys who could best be described as puppies, the last one being *very* puppy-like in his devotion and attempting to please.  Soo maybe instead of a boyfriend I should settle for a dog.  But again, would it be enough?  I am still pondering that question.         ",0

"632","3983151","Education","           According to  urlLink reports  today, former Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and presently the first&nbsp;Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge will step down after the November election, regardless of the outcome.&nbsp; The reasons he cites are that 'he is worn out from the massive reorganization of government and needs to earn money in the private sector to put his teenage children through college.'&nbsp; He's worried about being able to 'comfortably' put his kids through college....all two of them.&nbsp; The article also notes that public officials at Ridge's level can 'easily earn millions of dollars each year in the private sector.'  Included in the report is a snippit of his personal finances:  Salary as Governor from 1995-2001=$138316/year Salary as Secretary from 2001-Present=$175700/year Stocks and Funds=Between $122000 and $787000 House in Bethesda=$873000 (with a $784800 mortgage)  Let's compare this to a blue-collar, single-parent, two-child household in, say, Massachusetts.&nbsp; Hypothetically speaking, a middle-aged secretary at a job for 15 years makes ~$30000/year.&nbsp; (It's a little less, but we're giving ole Tommy Boy the benefit of the doubt).&nbsp; For those slow with division, the poor Secretary makes six times more than the poor secretary.&nbsp; One child went to a private university for ~$35000/year and received minimal federal aid because the parent made too much money.&nbsp; The other child is presently at a state school that is ~$10000/year.&nbsp; All parties involved had to take out interest-accruing loans, cash savings bonds, and use savings accounts to pay for school.  This family was never poverty-stricken by any standards:&nbsp; always had food on the table, always had clothes to wear, always had a roof above their heads, always had cars to get to work, etc.&nbsp; Bills were pretty much month-to-month, and there was not a whole lot of extra money for things.&nbsp; Vacations were rare.&nbsp; I would qualify that as 'barely living comfortably'.&nbsp; Sure, more money would have helped with expenses, but this family was doing just as well as every other blue-collar, single-income, middle-class family in America (if not better).&nbsp;   I find it disgusting that Ridge would use putting his kids through college as an excuse for leaving his post where he makes $175000 a year.&nbsp; If&nbsp;you're stressed out, just say so.&nbsp; If you hate your job, say so.&nbsp; If you don't think Bush will get re-elected and you're going to lose your job anyway, then say so (tactfully, or else you really  will  lose your job).&nbsp; But to say you can't afford 2 college tuitions as a member of the upper class...priceless.  &nbsp;          ",0

We were all a little cranky and it was hard to stay positive with a group of girls who are a little less than Olympic talent. We forget that they have one-track minds and that they are all about boys. That is all that is on their minds. I got to go 'Coach Langford' on them today, though. I was boiling and then a girl threw a ball to get it to the ball bin and hit me with it, instead. They all know that they are to walk the balls to the ball bin to avoid such an event. I slammed a ball down on the floor and screamed and made them do push-ups. They didn't try to throw the balls in the bin anymore after that. I forgot that I had such a temper. Nah, just kidding. I knew. You can all imagine the whole scene. LoLo with a red face and hollaring, trying not to let the voice get too shaky. Yeah. That's how it went. Anyway, I wasn't so 'krunk' today, but they still love me. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if I hadn't gotten clocked by the best hitter in the seventh grade that very morning. I mean, she hit that ball so hard that when it hit me in the jaw, it jerked my head over like in the movies when someone gets hit. I turned around to regain my focus and all of the coaches said that I had that glazed look. You know. The sleep-walking one. I couldn't hardly see or stand up, either.

The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down. 10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy. Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, 'I had no idea you were this religious.' The boy turns, and whispers back, 'I had no idea your father was a pharmacist.'           ",0

Make a piece of art.   Not every day.  I resolve to make this my top priority.         Play guitar.   Not at all.  But I think about it a lot.        Read something.

I did this .      Get a work-study job.   Nope.  Too late.       Start looking for a more permanent job.   Sort of looking.         Get art ready for group show.   I'm either gonna have to hassle that guy or set up my own show.  What's his deal?  Why did he go out of his way to give me his email address if he's not gonna email me back?  What's wrong w/people?  Write me back, fucker!  (As Sleater-Kinney say).     Start looking for places to sell my art - try contacting at least one exhibition space per week.   I've been bad.    So:    In light of discussions I've had with my art professor I need to contact publishers and galleries to get my work out there.  Specifically my independant project.  So I need to   Contact galleries  Contact publishers  Figure out how to put a book proposal together  Figure out how to put a gallery proposal together  Figure out how to get a grant to fund gallery work  Find a job that won't break my heart  Find my confidance again so I can do well in a job interview  Get interest relief for my student loan.

"653","3958175","indUnk","     Before I get into the smarts issue, my father has informed me that tsatskes is not a word, and that it should be spelled tschatschkes.&nbsp; I was originally thinking of spelling it tchachkes, but found it on a Yiddish lingo site spelled the way it ended up in yesterday's blog, so that's what I used.&nbsp; I feel that since Yiddish had its own alphabet (I think it was the Hebrew alphabet, or very close to it) that the English spelling is really irrelevant. &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I got an email from my cousin today 'bragging' about how well her dog is doing at school. * &nbsp; I wonder why my dogs are not quite so smart.&nbsp; Maybe it's because I didn't give them cerebral names like Ophelia (I'm not that creative) or maybe it's because they're inbred little bitches (that's not a swear in this case) and the more inbred you are, the dumber you are.&nbsp; I know several people who can attest to this. Haha.&nbsp;   Okay, maybe I exaggerated a wee bit.&nbsp; It's not that my dogs are actually stupid.&nbsp; They know their names, and recognize certain words, and can even do tricks.&nbsp; Here's a rundown of their abilities:      Brooklyn    Words/phrases she knows:   Bath  Wanna play? (meaning 'do you want to go outside and play catch?')  Wanna go for a walk?  Wanna go for a ride ?  Cookie  Ball  Toy  Bone  Go eat.  Go get some food.  Go drink.  Go get some water.  Want some dinner?  Want some food?  You want some?  Come.  C'mere.&nbsp;  Come on up! (as in get up on the bed)  Get down! (as in get off the bed.)  Go get it!  Go see!  Where is it?      Tricks she can perform:   Sit  Lie down  Roll over  Shake  Beg  Turn in a circle  She can also jump  really  high if you hold a ball over her head, but it's not a trick, just something cool she does.  Jump through a hoop  I have not yet attempted the blazing hoop trick, although tomorrow she's going to the groomer, so maybe I'll have them shave her bald so as to decrease the chance of setting her fur on fire when we do finally try the blazing hoop trick.&nbsp; Or not.     urlLink        Brooklyn Beg&nbsp;  urlLink           urlLink        Brooklyn Shake   &nbsp;  &nbsp;   Now Annie is our second dog.&nbsp; In the beginning, it was easy to say that she was dumber than Brooklyn because she was still a puppy.&nbsp; Seeing as she'll be 2 in about 4 weeks, I am not able to give any more excuses.&nbsp; She just is not as smart.&nbsp; Also, she has a problem with her back legs that keeps her from being able to jump very high or do cool tricks.   Annapolis    Words/phrases she knows   Kitty (Not an actual cat.&nbsp; It's a laser beam that she chases.&nbsp; This is why I think she's stupid.&nbsp; Brooklyn won't chase the laser.&nbsp; She barks her fool head off, knows exactly where the laser comes from and chases Annie with a toy in her mouth while Annie chases the beam.&nbsp; Dumb, yes?)  Cookie  Bone  Toy  Walk  Go eat.  Go get some food.  Go drink.  Go get some water.  Want some dinner?  Want some food?  Come get it.  Come here.  Come on up!  Get down!  You want some?  Go away. (usually said while I'm eating so that she'll stop staring at me)&nbsp;  Go see!  What was that? (In Annie's case, this usually elicits a short bark, as does 'Go see!')   Tricks she can perform:   Sit  Lie down  Shake hands  Circle  Now because she is dumb and also has the leg and&nbsp;obesity issue, she is not able to roll over.&nbsp; She never sprawls out on her back the way Brooklyn does.&nbsp; So when I was trying to teach her to roll over (which she kind of did before she got so fat) she got it into her head that substitutions are acceptable.&nbsp; If I made the hand motion for roll over, she would get up from her lying down position and turn around in a circle, thus affirming my theories on her stupidity and fat-/lazy-ness.&nbsp; It was so funny to me that I decided to teach Brooklyn to turn in circles, and now this is one of my favorite tricks of theirs.&nbsp; It's such a simple stupid thing, but it really makes me smile.     urlLink       Annie Shake&nbsp;  urlLink         So you be the judge.&nbsp; Are they really that stupid?&nbsp; Or am I (dammit that fly is back on my screen!&nbsp; More about that in a minute) being paranoid?&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As to the flies, will, there is of course a story on that.&nbsp; There is a light outside my kitchen door that I turn on at night.&nbsp; All sorts of winged creatures flit about it all night long.&nbsp; I go to walk the dogs and leave through the kitchen.&nbsp; The dogs are slow to come inside, and&nbsp;the screen door isn't the kind that slams (it&nbsp;closes slowly) and so the flies and moths enter my house.&nbsp; They're impossible to get rid of.&nbsp; Just one more reason why you should never ever get a dog.&nbsp;     ;)    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more information about and pictures of Brooklyn and Annapolis, visit these sites:    urlLink  http://www.dogster.com/dog_page.php?i=24711&amp;j=t   urlLink       urlLink  http://www.dogster.com/dog_page.php?i=24712&j=t     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  * Stephanie - you know I'm just playing with you             ",0

Are your palms sweaty, is your heart racing and is your voice caught within your chest?? - It isn't love, it's LIKE.  You can't keep your eyes or hands off of her/him -  It isn't love, it's LUST . Are you proud, and eager to show her/him off?? -  It isn't love, it's LUCK.  Do you want her because you know she's/he's there?? -  It isn't love, it's LONELINESS . Are you with her/him because it's what everyone wants??  It isn't love, it?s LOYALTY.  Are you with her because she/he kissed you, or held your hand?  It isn't love, it's LOW CONFIDENCE . Do you stay for her/him confessions of love, because you don't want to hurt her/him?  It isn't love, it's PITY . Do you belong to her/him because the sight of her/him makes your heart skip a beat??  It isn't love, it's INFATUATION . Do you pardon her faults because you care about her/him?  It isn't love, it's FRIENDSHIP . Do you tell her/him every day she is the only one you think of?  It isn't love, it's a LIE.  Are you willing to give up all of your favorite things for her sake?

We went downstairs to the basement after and played ping pong. We decided that we need more room to play so we cleaned up the basement. Now the basement is kind of clean and we can play ping pong without anything getting in the way. It's great. We made room for everything. We even put chairs downstairs for sitting (Duh). We played ping pong until my mom got home. I had to retake my yearbook photo so my mom and&nbsp;I went to Feltes to&nbsp;retake my&nbsp;photo. We ordered pizza for dinner.

"675","3938917","Student","        Wow. The last couple of days have been confusing to say the least. Monday, I don't remember doing much of anything but worrying about what Tyler was supposed to tell me. And what was it? I found out Tuesday it was that Tyler had cheated on me before he left for Canada...yea...definetly not something that made me all smiles. It was more of all tears. So that happened, but we've talked since then...and this is where it gets even more confusing. By Wednesday night we were pretty much fine, we'd talked about 3 hours, though he was drunk...which was scaring me because I didn't want him to pass out...at all...but now it's Thursday morning at about 4 o'clock. We talked about an hour ago, and the crazy 'l word' was pulled out...by him...for the first time. Yea, weird time for it huh? That's what I was thinking. Oh well, I'm still pretty lost about it all. I guess only time will tell. But for now I'm going to try to sleep...because he got offline a bit ago...kicked off I'm hoping. Left without good-bye..and yea he was crazy drunk again. I guess I'll find out soon enough...good night!           ",0
"676","3938005","indUnk","       For the July 4th weekend, Dean and I went to Asheville, NC to get away from everything and relax.&nbsp; Asheville is such a beautiful place.&nbsp; The energy there is just naturally conducive to good health.&nbsp; In spite of all the good 'vibes', I&nbsp;was feeling especially lethargic and heavy.&nbsp; Not comfortable, and certainly not healthy. &nbsp; We went to Malaprops, the coolest little bookshop in the downtown area, and I bought 'Living in the Light' by Shakti Gawain.&nbsp; Didn't really need the book, but got it anyway, and when I browsed through it I found a section on the body and&nbsp;health. &nbsp; Well, truth be known, I've been struggling with my&nbsp;weight and my health for a number of years and have been wanting to take control of my life and make positive lifetime changes.&nbsp; Like most people, the want to was there, but the will to change wasn't.&nbsp; Thus for nearly 1/3 of my life I've been carrying around 100+ extra pounds of fat I desperately wanted to lose but couldn't&nbsp;get motivated to lose. &nbsp; Then, over the course of that weekend, something happened. &nbsp; I decided, just simply decided, that I wanted to be healthy and attain a healthy weight for my body. &nbsp; It was that simple.&nbsp; Just a simple choice.&nbsp; And so far, it's proven to be a very profitable one in all accounts. &nbsp; There was a time I was addicted to breakfast biscuits, sweet iced tea, hot dogs, fried foods, potatoes in every guise, white flour products, and sugar.&nbsp; I broke myself of all these things and in two weeks time I can report that my energy level is way up, my clothes are a tad looser, and I feel fabulous. &nbsp; I've got a set of CDs by Dr. Deepak Chopra called 'Magical Mind, Magical Body'.&nbsp; I've listened to them off and on for two years, never applying any of his wisdom to my life...until now.&nbsp; In the teachings, he suggests that we need to be mindful eaters and listen to our bodies.&nbsp; Shakti offered similar advice about paying attention to what the body wants.&nbsp; I didn't realize that I was afraid of my body, afraid of paying attention to the one thing I hated most in life.&nbsp; I've learned to look at myself and love myself regardless of what I look like.&nbsp; In doing so, I've acknowledged and accepted my large breasts, long legs, and hour-glass figure that is hiding under 100 pounds of fat.&nbsp; In the past, this realization would have had me running for a honey bun to nurse the wounds of knowing my true self was buried under so much fat. &nbsp; Today, this knowledge has me running to unearth the real and beautiful me. &nbsp; I can't wait to see me again. &nbsp; I have a long way to go to get to where I want to be.&nbsp; When I weighed on Wednesday, July 14, I discovered I'm exactly 100 pounds to my goal weight.&nbsp; This does not deter me.&nbsp; This actually makes me more determined.&nbsp; I'm eager to see how my body is transformed, how my energy picks up, how my spirit feels.&nbsp; This blog will chart my progress.&nbsp; I will also list the foods I'm eating and maybe post some nutrition tips I've learned so far on my journey.&nbsp; Life is too short to be lived sub-par.&nbsp; Now that I've met and married my soul mate, I'm ready to finally attack this last nemesis in my life and move forward leaner, stronger, healthier, sexier, and fitter than I've ever been in my whole life. &nbsp; Here's to today! &nbsp;      ",0

Her rocket scientist husband goes from being a skeptic to a bemused believer as she embarks on solving crimes across the country. From What We've Seen: Although the show is based on a true story, selling audiences on a woman who can see and communicate with the dead is no easy task. The trailer played like 'The Sixth Sense' grafted on to a cop show, and featured dialogue like the main character telling a skeptical cop that 'I just felt' what happened to a murder victim.

I pled guilty, paid a fine, and had my driver's license suspended for 30 days. My Texas driving record has been 'lost' and is not available.                                                   Military:  I joined the Texas Air National Guard and went AWOL. I refused to take a drug test or answer any questions about my drug use. By joining the Texas Air National Guard, I was able to avoid combat duty in Vietnam.                                                   College: I graduated from Yale University with a low C average. I was a cheerleader.                                                   PAST WORK EXPERIENCE:                          I ran for U.S. Congress and lost. I began my career in the oil business in Midland,Texas, in 1975.                           I bought an oil company, but couldn't find any oil inTexas. The company went bankrupt shortly after I sold all my stock. Ibought the Texas Rangers baseball team in a sweetheart deal that took land using taxpayer money.                           With the help of my father and our friends in the oil industry (including Enron CEO Ken Lay), I was elected governor of Texas.                                                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS GOVERNOR OF TEXAS                          I changed Texas pollution laws to favor power and oil companies, making Texas the most polluted state in the Union. During my tenure, Houston replaced Los Angeles as the most smog-ridden city in America.                           I cut taxes and bankrupted the Texas treasury to the tune of billions in borrowed money.                           I set the record for the most executions by any governor in American history.                           With the help of my brother, the governor of Florida, and my father's appointments to the Supreme Court, I became President after losing by over 500,000 votes.                                                   ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:                          I am the first President in U.S. history to enter office with a criminal record.                           I invaded and occupied two countries at a continuing cost of over one billion dollars per week.                           I spent the U.S. surplus and effectively bankrupted the U.S. Treasury.                           I shattered the record for the largest annual deficit in U.S. history.                           I set an economic record for most private bankruptcies filed in any 12-month period.                           I set the all-time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.                           I set the all-time record for the biggest drop in the history of the U.S. stock market. In my first year in office, over 2 million Americans lost their jobs and that trend continues every month.                           I'm proud that the members of my cabinet are the richest of any administration in U.S. history. My 'poorest millionaire,' Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named after her.                           I set the record for most campaign fund-raising trips by a U.S. President.                           I am the all-time U.S. and world record-holder for receiving the most corporate campaign donations.                           My largest lifetime campaign contributor, and one of my best friends, Kenneth Lay, presided over the largest corporate bankruptcy fraud in U.S. History, Enron.                           My political party used Enron private jets and corporate attorneys to assure my success with the U.S. Supreme Court during my election decision.                           I have protected my friends at Enron and Halliburton against investigation or prosecution. More time and money was spent investigating the Monica Lewinsky affair than has been spent investigating one of the biggest corporate rip- offs in history.                           I presided over the biggest energy crisis in U.S. history and refused to intervene when corruption involving the oil industry was revealed. I presided over the highest gasoline prices in U.S. history.                           I changed the U.S. policy to allow convicted criminals to be awarded government contracts.                           I appointed more convicted criminals to administration than any President in U.S. history.                           I created the Ministry of Homeland Security, the largest bureaucracy in the history of the United States government.                           I've broken more international treaties than any President in U.S. history.                           I am the first President in U.S. history to have the United Nations remove the U.S. from the Human Rights Commission.                           I withdrew the U.S. from the World Court of Law.                           I refused to allow inspector's access to U.S. 'prisoners of war' detainees and thereby have refused to abide by the Geneva Convention.                           I am the first President in history to refuse United Nations election inspectors (during the 2002 U.S. election).                           I set the record for fewest numbers of press conferences of any President since the advent of television.                           I set the all-time record for most days on vacation in any one-year period. After taking off the entire month of August, I presided over the worst security failure in U.S. history.                           I garnered the most sympathy for the U.S. after the World Trade Center attacks and less than a year later made the U.S. the most hated country in the world, the largest failure of diplomacy in world history.                           I have set the all-time record for most people worldwide to simultaneously protest me in public venues (15 million people), shattering the record for protests against any person in the history of mankind.                           I am the first President in U.S. history to order an unprovoked, pre-emptive attack and the military occupation of a sovereign nation. I did so against the will of the United Nations, the majority of U.S. citizens, and the world community.                           I have cut health care benefits for war veterans and support a cut in duty benefits for active duty troops and their families -- in wartime.                           In my State of the Union Address, I lied about our reasons for attacking Iraq and then blamed the lies on our British friends.                           I am the first President in history to have a majority of Europeans (71%) view my presidency as the biggest threat to world peace and security.                           I am supporting development of a nuclear 'Tactical Bunker Buster,' a WMD.                           I have so far failed to fulfill my pledge to bring Osama Bin Laden [sic] to justice.                                                   RECORDS AND REFERENCES:                          All records of my tenure as governor of Texas are now in my father's library, sealed and unavailable for public view.

I have no idea what Verona is supposed to taste like, but I figured that fresh is better than whatever might be sitting in the thermoses around the other side of the counter and went for it.   Apparently,  Verona  stands for  remarkably bitter .  I put 9 (yes, NINE) packets of sugar in my medium coffee, and all of the fat free milk they had, plus a good amount of half and half.  Still, it's dark and has a bitter burnt aftertaste.  And, foretaste....  or whatever you call it when the tip of your tongue recoils in terror from the acrid bitterness of the coffee that you're forcing past it.   So, I went to the Starbucks website and did a search on  Verona .  Here's what it turned up:  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    CaffÃ¨ VeronaÂ®    Originally we blended this for a Seattle restaurant as the ideal after-dinner coffee. The crisp acidity of the medium-bodied Latin American coffees is grounded with the earthy flavor of the Indonesian coffees. A sweetness gilds the coffee's slight smokiness -creating a deep, rich dessert coffee.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   Medium my ass.  Bold would probably give me whiplash.  I hate starbucks.  I really do.

Scott Glenn and Ed Harris rack up major acting points as a Secret Service agent and a police detective, respectively. Clint rawks as Luther Whitney,the aging jewel thief, and proves that even though he's old as dirt he can still play a badass.  Good Story. Good Acting. Gene Hackman plays an awesome evil bastard.

"689","3926753","indUnk","           I thought that I would post some decent reads because I think the best way to find out about new books and authors or to help others find out about them, is to talk about them. Yes, that is indeed one confusing paragraph but it should get the point across.  First off, although I am not a big fan of western books I do read alot of Louis L'Amour. Mainly because I own over 150 of his books and I am able to stand reading them more than once. The book of his that I am reading at the moment is  To Tame a Land .  I also have recently bought the entire  Sword of Change  series by Patricia Bray. Its a fantasy-type book with good action and even better humor. And the plot in the first two books is exellent, although the plot in the third and final book in the series is lacking. Buts its more than worth reading. The best part about the series has got to be that it is rather new and from an author new to the fantasy genre.  Some other books/series that I'm into, but that are also more well known are  The Sword of Truth  series by Terry Goodkind,  the Wheel of Time  series by Robert Jordan,  Deathstalker  series by Simon R. Green,  the Art of War  by Sun Tzu and  Go Rin No Sho  or  A Book of Five Rings  by Miyamoto Musashi. I'd write a bit about each one of these series/books, but there are just so many good sources of information on them already online that I feel my thoughts just aren't needed.  Of course, these are just a small amount of the good books out there just waiting to be read. And feel free to suggest other goods books in the comments as well.         ",0

"694","3918642","Student","           I just read Erica's blog. I had been waiting for her to post. She said a lot of stuff and it just really bugs me. Yesterday, it took so much to just try to get myself to ask her if she wanted to be there for my birthday. I honestly really wanted her there but it was a question of whether  she  wanted to be there. I didn't know and I was afraid she'd ignore me or just say no. I really missed her and wished everything could be okay again. I got myself to ask her and she said she could come. I saw Martin's display picture on MSN and thought it was really funny. It was a picture of him and Roger on White Water Canyon, looking really scared. The funny & cute part of the picture is the fact that they were really little. As in age-wise. It was just priceless. I thought about Erica the moment I started laughing at it and I knew that she was probably still mad at me and wanted me 'out of her life'. Since she wasn't ignoring me, I decided to tell her to look at Martin's display picture and said that I hoped it would bring a smile on her face. She couldn't see it so I told Martin to send it to her. He said I was a good friend to do that but I'm not so sure about that... She got it at last and thought it was funny too, I think. She said 'lol' or something so yeah. I just assumed she liked it. We talked a bit more about other things and yeah. She has no idea how badly I wanted things to be back to the way they were. No idea. I really wanted everything to be okay again, before this whole thing.   In her blog, she said that she was gonna take back what she said but then she read her comment on her blog page and wasn't so sure again. It was I who left a comment on her blog page. I wrote some stuff to clarify some things and I... I said that it wouldn't be a problem to stay out of her life. I guess I was just letting my pride get in the way again. I know that it  isn't  a problem, but it's not something I want to live with. Like I said, no matter what happens Erica would always be the one I go running to anyway. Even with the littlest things. She says I lecture her but I wouldn't know if I do or not. I don't mean to do a lot of things that I do. I mean, I'm me! It's typical of me to not know what I'm doing half the time. I think before I act or speak most of the time too!   I've tried acting perfect and nice. I've tried being Miss Nice Person but it's just... not me. Does everyone really think I love little kids? Sure, they're cute! Sure, they're nice! But I only like kids when they're nice! I wanna freak out everytime they start climbing all over me or bug me when something needs to be done that's actually serious with my friends. They  do  get on my nerves! But most of the time, I try to keep on a smile and just laugh along with them. Some of them are really nice (sincerely), some of them are annoying, and some of them just like bugging me on purpose. I'm not super-friendly. I'm not a great listener. I don't give the best advice in the world... And most of all, I act like a mom to Erica more than a best friend because I care about her a lot and I don't want anything to happen. Yeah, I guess I'm over-protective, but it's only 'cos I care. She knows I do.  It hurted that she had second thoughts about things. I really missed her. I wanted to be back in her life. I wanted things to be back to the way they were... even if we got on each other's nerves all the time. I love Erica as a best friend... I still care. Even if she wants me out of her life, I'd still care about what she does... I can't do anything about what she does but I still care so much... I just want her back.         ",0

"697","3914785","Technology","             In job interviews, there's a clichÃ© question: 'tell me about your weaknesses.' It's so over-used, there's a crafty stock answer: 'Well, I've been told sometimes I work too hard and I need to slow down. And I'm a bit of a perfectionist, and I have to make sure my colleagues don't resent my pushing for their best work.'  In a high-pressure situation, you may prefer to be, as they say, 'economical with the truth' when asked a question like this. But privately, everyone has real, actual weaknesses. And every weakness is an opportunity for self-enlightenment and growth.  I don't want to waste your time talking about how I enjoy a leisurely start to the day and have trouble being in the office before 7:00am. Instead, I'm going to generalize and share an observation:  every personality trait is simultaneously a strength and a weakness .  For example, I enjoy writing about my feelings on this blog. However, I have to watch the positive to negative ratio: when I spend my time slamming the hoi-polloi, I'm giving in to the negative side of my passion. I'm not alone: there's an entire industry of academics slamming each other's work, so much so that I found this meta-essay:  urlLink 'Considered Harmful' Essays Considered Harmful .  Likewise, I'm passionate about solving hard problems in elegant ways. Bingo! There's a weakness, a hacker mentality, a ' urlLink he'd rather be slinging Lisp on Linux than grinding Java on Windows NT ' attitude. It's true, that's how I usually feel about my work (although I don't use Lisp: a real hacker can write Scheme programs in any language).  By the way, this attitude is not restricted to language weenies. The next time you see a J2EE application with factories, persistence mechanisms, XML-ification of everything, and Inversion of Control, you'll see the handiwork of someone passionate about J2EE architecture.  The trick, I guess, is taking stock of your traits and making sure you minimize the deleterious effects of them while maximizing the benefits. Last year I joined a team working on a J2EE/Oracle application. There were some hard problems to solve, and I was more excited by the 2% of the work that were the hard problems than dismayed by the 98% of the work that was routine.  And there I'll stop. The important thing is to constantly look for the 2% of your world that fuels your passion in a positive way!          ",0
"698","3911293","indUnk","       The following is an excerpt from this week's  urlLink Savage Love :   Did you know that if you Google 'huge breasts,' you get 1,170,000 hits? But if you Google 'huge balls,' you get only 67,000? And that if you Google 'huge asshole,' you get 8,830â€”including a link to the official White House web site?  My assistant, Mahrya, discovered these amazing facts, BREAST, while tracking down Tiffany Towers and Wendy Whoppers, neither of whom responded, as they say at The New York Times, to my repeated requests for comment. I could have looked up 'huge breasts' myself, I suppose, but enormoboobs are so early- to mid-Clinton-era, you know? I like to reserve my time for researching newer, freakier fetishes, thank you very much, so it seemed like the perfect assignment for my assistant. Apparently not. Shortly after tracking down Tiffany Towers, Mahrya informed me that she's moving on. It seems my assistant found more respectable work at a law firm where she won't have to Google 'huge breasts' ever again. (The partners will have to Google that for themselves.) While I'm sorry to see Mahrya goâ€”thanks for everything, Mâ€”I am looking forward to hiring a new assistant. Does spending the day Googling enormoboobs, tracking down retired porn stars, and gently reminding me about deadlines I've already missed sound appealing? Send me an e-mail. (Male applicants are encouraged to enclose pictures of themselves in Speedos.)   The following is the email I sent to Dan Savage in response to his job posting:     Dear Dan,   I'm a recent university grad who's been vainly searching for administrative work in the wiles of eastern Canada.  I live in Fredericton, New Brunswick, about a four-hour drive from your friends at Venus Envy in Halifax, and about an hour and a half from the Maine border.  Anyway, I would be more than happy to relocate to sunny Seattle if you'd be willing to hire me as your assistant... I've got a brother in Portland and I love the Pacific North West.    Working as your assistant makes perfect sense for me because since I've been unemployed, I already spend a great deal of time Googling terms like 'huge boobs'.  I'm sorry that I'm not a boy who wears Speedos, but rest assured that my bushy-tailed enthusiasm will more than make up for my missing appendages.  I've been a fan of yours for years, and I promise to never leave you for a law firm.  I've attached my resume, and I hope to hear from you.  Cheers,  Mary   Hello dream job!    ",0

"711","3889807","indUnk","        urlLink Andrew Sullivan , for those not in the know, is a prominent Right-Wing pundit - a right hate peddler in the Clinton days apparently but has, in fairness, being quite balanced since GWB took over. At least balance in comparison to the rest of the increasingly partisan political commentary&nbsp;in America.&nbsp;   However as a Log-Cabin Republican [Gay Republican],&nbsp;Sullivan has been left in a bit of a weird place. Does he support Bush [and therefore the main protagonist in removing his rights currently] or go with Kerry [and -ye gads- be forced to vote Democrat]? Due to&nbsp;the fact that Kerry will have two Republican houses to deal with, Sullivan makes the -probably valid- point that Kerry may end up being fiscally more conservative then Bush; who spends like there is no tomorrow [although that could be because he knows something we don't know]. So that is another point against the big Dubya. Only defense seems to keep Sullivan hanging around [God only knows why as I would have thought that was Bushes weakest point].   Anyway the reason I mention this is that Sullivan's site now has a little Donkey [I pretty sure it wasn't there before]&nbsp;peering out over the logo for the Daily Dish. Has Bush lost a fairly prominent pundit or is Sullivan just trying to annoy the number of conservative writers who have chided him recently for expressing doubts on Bush? Interesting ... or maybe not. Anyway I thought it rather fascinating so now it is stuck in your brain.    Oh well, two posts regarding homosexuality in a row ...

"723","3880669","Telecommunications","   Last week the â€œEuropean Championshipsâ€ are ran at the Vic.  They held two satellites on the Sunday and a huge one on Friday, the night before the main event.  Was I there, chasing the big prize ?  No way !  These satellites are a bad deal IMO.  Hereâ€™s why :     Â·         Tough fields.  The satellites themselves are a bit of a mixture, but many of the best players do play.  But winning a seat is only half the battle.  Then you have to come back and play in a very tough line up.  About as tough as it gets.  Not good !   Â·         Small chance of winning.  Apparently on the Sunday there were 100 runners in the Â£2500 Satellite, with 10 seats given away.  Satellite entrants had a 10% chance of winning a seat (less if not prepared to rebuy).  If you qualify, 10% of the field usually get paid in the main event.  Thatâ€™s two 9-1 shots, a 99-1 double !  You have a 1% chance of making any money at all.  Variance is off the scale.   Â·         Even smaller chance of a big win.  The majority of the money goes to the top three places (which is only right, I have no complaint with that).  If your target comp has 150 runners, you have a 1 in 50 chance of finishing top 3.  Parlay that up with your 10% chance of winning a seat â€“ 500 to 1.  And thatâ€™s assuming your skill level is around the average !   Â·         Double rake.  The Vic made Â£25 from every direct entrant, thatâ€™s all theyâ€™re allowed to.  But with the satellites, 100 entrants at Â£10 each makes Â£1000 from 10 seats !  Plus the Â£250 they take off the satellite winners !  And if you do win a seat, your expenses (travelling, time off etc) are doubled as well.   Â·         Time consuming.  4 hours in a satellite plus, if you win, 5 or 6 hours average in the comp, 14-16 hours or more to make the money !  Not a problem if you consider it as entertainment, but this is time you could be making money in better games.    Â·         Satellites, IMO, arenâ€™t entertaining at all.  They are boring !  Survive, survive, survive.  Repeat ad nauseam while waiting for someone else to be knocked out.  Zzzzzzzz   Â·         Collusion.  I tend to downplay fears of collusion in normal tournaments.  There isnâ€™t a great deal someone can do to help a partner without hurting themselves almost as much.  In other words itâ€™s not easy for a partnership to gain a significant edge over the rest of the field by colluding.  And because most colluders arenâ€™t the sharpest tools in the box, they donâ€™t know how to do it right anyway (and no, Iâ€™m not going to tell you).  In a super-satellite, itâ€™s a different story.  Once you get close to the end, you often find that up to half the remaining players are virtually certain of qualifying.  These players can help their mates out a lot without endangering themselves at all.  And the correct strategy is pretty obvious â€“ when your mate goes all-in, you fold !  I believe this goes on quite a lot.  You even see people who wonâ€™t normally do anything out of order enter a super-sat with their partner, and if either one wins, the stronger player will take the seat.  This amounts to the same thing.  If youâ€™re playing it straight, on your own, this can really hurt you sometimes.   Of course, as always in poker, there are upsides as well.  You can learn from watching the good players around you ;  itâ€™s quite exciting, in a way, to play for big money ;  and of course if you do get lucky you could net a big score (although I could say the same about the lottery).  However, I do think you can learn a lot in Â£50 comps (try Saturday nights in Luton, lots of good players, too many for my liking).  And you can play for quite a lot of money (surely enough to get excited about) in Â£100 and Â£200 comps without all this screwing around with satellites.    Anyway Iâ€™ll give them a miss.  Just one more thing, in the style of Columbo, to think about.  If you derive a lot of self-esteem from playing and being seen in the biggest games around, get a grip.  You could get professional therapy for a fraction of the cost and a real, long-term benefit.  Iâ€™m deadly serious.    ",0

"727","3876646","indUnk","       Seems like I can never get rid of my insecurities. Even after 2 years being with Vooty, I still am preparing for the day that he will dump my ass. I guess its all about being prepared. I agree that such preparations will serve more harm than good, if I could help it, I would stop. Believe me. But I can't help it. Therefore, I can't stop.  For what it's worth, he has done nothing to make me worry so. But every late night, every meeting, every trip away from me makes me fret. It's not like he has been treating me differently or colder than usual. It's just me.  Sometimes, I think the industry that he is in makes me worry more. To think of it, it is probably the safest industry to be in because any office romance or affairs will result in a termination. And being in the porn industry, law suits against sexual harressment is a high taboo. With such strict rules, people generally are more alert with such on-goings. Kinda reduces the chances somehow. But then, forbiddened fruits always tastes the sweetest, doesn't it? Yeah..it does.  We had a fight last night. I hurt my wrist while I was struggling to get away from him. I have weak/loose joints. Most of the time, its my left wrist that gets hurt, but this time, I hurt my right wrist. And I do not have a cast for my right. So I guess it's living with excrutiating pain for the next week until it heals.  The fight was a builtup of tension. He had a bad day, I had a bad day. I was looking forward to see him for dinner, he feels I was crowding and rushing him out of the house. He flared up, I lost my control. Its a builtup. He tried to come to me to hug me, I wasn't in the mood to be pacified. I put up a fight, he tried to grab me, I hurt my wrist. He threatened to leave the house and not return home for the night. I stopped him. Had a screaming fit and finally settled down. Neither one of us actually apologized. Perhaps we both felt that each other was at fault, but also, we were both at fault too. Dunnoe how to apologize for things like this. I am sorry for what I did, but you are at fault too ? Sounds kinda pointing finger when said that way.  I told him he hurt my wrist, he apologized for that. He wants me to get a cast for it because I have loose joints and I have to immobilized it to allow it to heal quickly. I can live with a cast on my right wrist, because I am left handed. Probably will go get one later tonight. He is working late, I am making dinner for him. Maybe we can go and get the cast after dinner.   I always feel insecure, it has killed so many relationships already. I will bolt out of a relationship before it has the chance to go bad on me. Even though the only thing that was going bad was my imagination. It didn't matter to me, I will still run off. Even with Vooty, I have had occassions in the past that I ran off because I thought that he was being unfaithful and was fucking some other bitches behind my back.  I don't feel secure. No matter what the guy does, how much he tries to convince me, I still left. I have had guys that would have done anything to prove their love for me, it still wouldn't have mattered. Vooty doesn't do half as much as what those guys were willing to, but I trust him more than the rest. But trusting him more than I trust the rest is not enough, I still get bouts of insecurities hitting me.  I love my guy so much, so much until I am feeling so vulnerable to any form of hurt that he will be giving me. Perhaps I am wounded up too tight, with all the stress of my schooling and such. To the point that every joke or tease will seem like a carefully planted jibe.  Securities, I need securities. Even after meeting his collegues at work, and having them tell me that he is a great guy and that I am lucky to have gotten him, I am still fretting over some imaginary bitch that he is fucking while at work. If I dun stop my insecurities from building up, things will go wrong. I will become cold and guarded and then things will really go downhill.

"728","3876159","Education","       Yea right, I didn't write this but did find it interesting to have.  &nbsp;    Milan    From the enchanted rooftop world of the Duomo, you can see the graceful porticoes and ornate friezes of medieval Milan fade into the sharp lines and angles of the modern city. It's a clear reminder that Milan isn't just a relic from the past. It's a bustling, forward-looking city whose fashion sense and robust economy drive northern Italy -- if not the entire country.  Often called the least Italian of the country's cities   (BOO),   Milan doesn't draw the tourists that tend to overrun Rome, Florence and Venice   (YEH!...darn you obtrusive tourists).   But once you've strolled its narrow downtown streets and visited its spacious suburban parks, we think you'll find its blend of old and new quite appealing. Yes, it's a big-business city, with hundreds of banks and corporate offices. But it also has plenty of attractions -- including its many-spired cathedral, a world-renowned opera house, the Galeria Vittorio Emanuele II (a soaring filigree structure of steel and glass that was the first indoor mall), and dozens of smart designer boutiques -- to keep you busy for a few days, if not a full week.      Milan Climate    Summer temperatures, which often extend into September, average in the 80s F/high 20s C but can feel warmer because of the humidity. Winter is cold, with little precipitation and temperatures usually in the 40s F/just below 10 C. Spring brings milder temperatures, as well as a lot of rain. The best time to visit Milan is in autumn   (Fabulous, just what I wanted to hear)  , when the weather is crisp, cool, sunny and breezy. But the city's heavy fog and smog can bring a gray day almost any time of year.      Milan Transportation    Central Milan is quite small, and most of it can be covered easily on foot. But if you prefer to spend time seeing the sights rather than walking, Milan's extensive transportation system is a convenient way to get from place to place.  Trams are fun, easy and inexpensive. Some of the old ones date from the early 1900s and add local color to the city. The heavily traveled subway system (or metro) is efficiently run and convenient. Most people will take the etro over any other type of transportation because it's faster. Milan also has an extensive bus system, which shares a ticketing system with both the trams and the metro. The metro operates 6 am-midnight, buses and trams 6 am-1 am.  Taxis are available but expensive and somewhat inconvenient. They only pick up passengers at designated stands and hotels unless they've been ordered by phone.       ",0
"729","3875945","Arts","                 My cousin emailed this to me. He works with this soldier's step-father.  _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _   Dave will be moved to Bethesda sometime today for surgery on his eyes.  Itâ€™s a 10+ hour flight, so surgery may not be until tomorrow or the next day.  Dave still has shrapnel in his face, near his brain, and near his retina. We were concerned about possible damage to the brain either by movement before the surgery or during the removal process. The doctor assured us that is not likely. He has 20/200 vision in one eye and no vision in the other. They did an ultra sound on the eyes and the good news is the retinas are not detached. The outcome of his vision is undetermined. They started him on a clear liquid diet, trying to get him used to foods again and have started walking him a little, getting him out of bed.  He may also receive skin graphs on his thigh that has a hole about the size of a 50-cent piece, about an inch deep. One of his eardrums is burst, but that either will repair itself or can be repaired.  The doctor said he believes the other shrapnel wounds will be fine. The doctor feels positive about his recovery.  I have a little more detail about what happened.  Daveâ€™s platoon was called out in response to the helicopter being shot down early Thursday morning. They had been actively engaged in a firefight at the cemetery for about 10 hours.  Now for the real miracle: We told Dave he is on the prayer list of so many churches and people all over the country are praying for him. He said, â€œMom, I want to make this real clear. When people pray for me, I want it to be prayers of thanks that Iâ€™m still alive. I should be dead now.â€ Then he told us the RPG hit his helmet. He said if it was not a direct hit, it was a partial hit. He saw it coming and felt the impact. Please remember that in your prayers and give thanks. Dave said he will never be so vain as to complain about some blurred vision knowing how close he came to death. He said he canâ€™t even pray for his eyesight because he feels God has already done so much for him.  Dave is in good spirits and has a positive attitude.   He said, â€œMom, I want to be real firm about this and you have to understand. Once I recover from all this, Iâ€™m going right back. I have to be with my Marines.â€                   ",0
"730","3875914","indUnk","        There are two people I'd like to say good-bye to today:  This   urlLink  wonderful little girl   , who touched many, many people.  And my friend Victor, whose funeral I attended Monday.       Victor was a pain in the ass... and my pal.  I met Vic through my   urlLink  cat club    (yes, cat club). He'd been a member of Lincoln State for a long time before I joined, but he welcomed me warmly... then set me to work. For the past several years he's been our Show Manager -- a thankless, miserable job that's comparable to herding cats on horseback for an entire year at a time. Our club is a not-for-profit, with members from Illinois and Wisconsin (and at one point, also from Indiana). A group of about 12-20 members at any given time. Volunteers, one and all. A most unlikely army, but Vic was always up to the task.  Why? Well, Vic was one of the most organized people I ever met. He juggled membership in a number of cat clubs (besides LSCC), showing his own cats several weekends a month, maintaining a   urlLink  cattery   , running a family, and running his own business. I think the reason he was so good at it is that, like a good general, he was great at giving orders no one would dare to disobey. Not family, not friends, and certainly not volunteers. Yes, he liked to be in charge.  For example, because of Vic, I've been on television (local access cable and three different regular networks) and three different radio shows over the last several years. Why? As Vic put it, 'Nobody else is willing to do it. You're too stupid to be scared, and persistent enough to be effective at getting us publicity on the air.' Yep. That was my pal. But, as crazy as he could make you with fourteen billion phone calls a day asking if you'd completed your latest assignment yet, he was always great at saying 'thank-you' and 'well done' when you did something right.  Although I have not shown at all recently, I spent a lot of weekends at cat shows with Vic over the years. He was the first breeder to plop a   urlLink  Somali    in my hands to show me the   urlLink  finer points    of the breed. And when I needed someone to agent my   urlLink  Devon Rex    champion, Peanut, at a show up in Milwaukee, Vic was the first to volunteer. (Of course, he came to regret that choice. Peanut took a power dump -- as only a Devon can do -- in her carrier on the trip home. Vic said he and Pam spent the last 50 miles of the trip with their heads stuck out the windows of the Suburban. Heh!)       Vic also knew a bazillion people in the cat fancy, and he introduced me to many judges, clerks and breeders/exhibitors from all over the U.S. I made many, many good friends because of him.  Nobody liked a good dinner out like Vic. His favorite place of all time was Harvey's Prime Rib in Clarendon Hills. But anywhere that had good prime rib and great cocktails was alright with him. Being diabetic, he was supposed to be careful with his diet... but anyone who traveled to shows will tell you the most frequent words out of his mouth were 'Don't tell Pam' as he was about to indulge in another naughty no-no. Show night Saturdays were special, indeed.      As opinionated and pushy as Vic could be, one of the most endearing things about him was his absolute blindness to color, creed or sexual preference. He looked straight into your heart and based his friendships on what he saw there alone. His friends saw that right away. As far as Vic was concerned, anyone who didn't get it didn't matter.      The other thing people always understood about him, whether they liked him or not, was that he adored his wife, kids and grandchild. Family was first. No question.      Beloved husband, father and grandfather, respected architect and pain-in-the-ass pal. I miss him already. I can't imagine what it will be like to hold a club meeting without him. I  do  know that he's over the   urlLink  Rainbow Bridge    with pets and friends who went on before him. And I'll take some comfort in that.   _____           ",0

The tension was pretty apparent on the campus well before the election day. Much lobbying and grouping and backbiting were going on. Some mysterious made lots of aspiring candidates to withdraw their nominations days before the election. Being in the least affected C hostel i have only hearsay of these happenings. But it was in the air...no mistaking that.  There was no visible campaigning happening in the campus before the election day. But things changed drastically on the election day.

(the blank expression on their faces is something that was pretty amusing to watch!). But all in all it was coordinated and carried out well. For once there were not many PJs or bekaar questions...though were enough double meaning questions.  10 candidates for the post of 4. Out which I'd say only a few were actually visible in the batch! (or is it just me?!) Each of them had their 7-9 minutes of fame....fielding all sorts of questions. Was interesting watching the dynamics of the batch.  There were some highly popular candidates who had their own cheering team. Most of them gave their best shot at selling themselves. Some went on to talk about their past achievements, some into their strong agenda if they win, some got senti, some tried to make the audiance senti, some had only a few words to say and left it all to their faith in themselves and the batch.  The results were not very surprising. 3 who i thought would win, actually won. The exit polls were pretty accurate too. Now we are waiting for the elected members to live upto their promises.    Rohit Motu Gupta ....are you listening? I cant see the ppts in the public folder yet!   well there's always the reelction! :P  Bottomline after the SCON election  'Actions speak louder than words' .

If he got misinformed, he acted on it, not because he is corrupt, but because he believes it will make the world a better place. I think that Clinton made for a good representative of America because his values reflected those of our country. So when people looked at Clinton, they saw what Americans are like - we cheat on our wives and lie about it! On the other hand, I believe Bush is a good president because he does not represent American values. He is above that. Bush has the type of values that demand he does what is true and noble and righteous, which is what I would love America to represent! But we don't, which is tragic. But rather than an accurate representative, we have a righteous man who can lead us to becoming a more moral nation, as well as making the world a little more safe for our children by discouraging terrorism in the most ominous ways he can.

"741","3858248","indUnk","       In the Western media, the al-Jazeera satellite news network is often described as 'the Arab CNN.' This is certainly how many Canadian commentators have described it during the debate about admitting the network to this country's airwaves.  But the term is misleading. Like other major Western news networks, CNN purports to be an objective news source. The same cannot be said for al-Jazeera.  Few of its viewers in the Arab world could mistake al-Jazeera's slant on the 'War against Terror.' In Egypt, one media commentator has dubbed it 'al-Qaeda's satellite channel.' Another calls it 'the terrorists' mouthpiece.' Though exaggerations, they contain a grain of truth.  Part of al-Jazeera's appeal is based on its direct access to important sources. Following U.S. action against al-Qaeda in Afghanistan in late 2001, blurry images of missile strikes were produced by the U.S. military. But only one voice emerged to tell the story from the targets' perspective. At the beginning of the war, al-Jazeera correspondent Tayseer Allouni was the sole international journalist reporting regularly from Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. Indeed, his face competed with prerecorded messages from Osama bin Laden for air time throughout the world.  Allouni reported on the mood in Kabul. Paula Zahn interviewed him on CNN. His demeanor was well-suited to a Western audience. But the question remains: Why was he the only reporter who the Taliban government allowed in the capital? It is curious that as soon as the Taliban left Kabul, Allouni left as well. Later, he was the subject of allegations connected to the Madrid bombings of March 11, and forbidden to leave Spain. Yet he continues to report for al-Jazeera to this day.  -- There is about 3 more pages of information. Incredible. Please read the entire article.   Andrew B.    ",0

"743","3858248","indUnk","        Read it all...incredible    Posted: July 14, 2004 1:00 a.m. Eastern  Â©Â 2004Â WorldNetDaily.com  When Pierre Rehov saw images of a 12-year-old Palestinian boy being shot, it altered the course of his life.  The film producer was stunned to learn Israel had been accused of targeting young Mohammed al-Dura, whose gripping death in the arms of his father was an image broadcast around the world. Indeed, the graphic images of the boy dying in his father Jamal's arms, supposedly murdered by Israeli soldiers, became the icon of the newly launched intifada and fueled the ambitions of a thousand young, would-be suicide bombers.  'I was in shock,' Rehov said in a recent magazine interview. 'In this case, I knew as a producer that there was something very fishy about the images. The angles just weren't right.'  One day after watching footage of al-Dura's death, Rehov, an Algerian-born Jew who lives in France, was thrust into action when he witnessed a pro-Palestinian rally in the streets of Paris, where demonstrators screamed 'Death to the Jews.' The al-Dura video had been videotaped by a Palestinian freelance photographer working for France 2 television.  An Israeli passport holder, Rehov took off for the Holy Land to investigate the suspicious death of the 12-year-old boy. He found numerous inconsistencies, including the trajectory of Israeli gunfire and the position of the bullet holes. Although al-Dura was buried before an autopsy could be performed, Rehov was convinced he had evidence the Palestinians themselves killed al-Dura for propaganda purposes.  'It is not so hard to believe from some of these extremists who indoctrinate their children to be martyrs and suicide bombers,' he told Lifestyles magazine.  Indeed, as WorldNetDaily has reported, independent studies of the incident show the boy couldn't have been shot by Israeli soldiers as alleged. Moreover, there is compelling evidence that the 'shooting death' of little Mohammed al-Dura was a piece of intentional Arab 'street theatre' staged by Palestinians to portray Israelis as child murderers.  Since the al-Dura incident and Rehov's revelations about it, the filmmaker has immersed himself in documenting, up-close and personal, the true nature of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. To date he has produced six documentaries, highlighted on a new website that communicates his conviction that Palestinian leaders have created a mythology every reporter working in the disputed territories is compelled to buy if he wants to work safely.  'There is no freedom of press under the Palestinian Authority, and no journalist can report honestly without risking his life,' says Rehov.  Traveling to Israel with his digital recorder, Rehov began undercover investigations of what is really happening behind the scenes in that troubled region. His films include 'Israel and the War Of Images,' on Palestinian television and media; 'The Trojan Horse,' uncovering Yasser Arafat's true designs; 'Holy Land: Christians in Peril,' on why Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus, is no longer a Christian town; 'The Road to Jenin,' exposing the Palestinian 'massacre' hoax; 'Silent Exodus,' on the expulsion of a million Jews from Arab countries after 1948; and 'Hostages of Hatred,' why most Palestinians still are considered refugees after more than five decades.  Like perhaps nothing else commercially available, Rehov's documentaries take the viewer behind the scenes to experience the stunning reality â€“ so often obscured by the world's news media â€“ of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. For instance, 'Israel and the War of Images' proves, through exclusive footage of Palestinian leaders including Yasser Arafat, that their goal remains the eradication of the Jewish state. In it, the viewer can:  1. Watch Arafat call for jihad (in Arabic).  2. Watch his reaction when a daring reporter questions his training of young children in the art of war against Israel.  3. Watch the indoctrination of young children and girls into martyrdom for his cause.  4. Watch victims of Arafat's terrorism deal with their pain and suffering.  Rehov was born into a Jewish family in Algeria where his ancestors had lived for nearly 500 years. He came to France in 1961 with 250,000 Jewish refugees who were expelled from the territory after it came under Muslim rule.  At school in Algeria, his classmates called him a 'dirty Jew' and other kids praised Adolf Hitler. As a child, he witnessed two terror attacks by Muslim extremists rebelling against French rule. In one, he saw people exiting a cafe drenched in blood and without limbs. Another took place at his school where 11 classmates were killed.  At 9 years old, Rehov, his mother, and younger brother left Algeria to join his father, already in France.  Although his documentaries are authoritative and powerful, so far French television channels have refused to air any of them.  But Rehov has found an ingenious method of distribution, taking advantage of Franceâ€™s freedom of expression laws, which require newsstands to carry publications regardless of their point of view.  He created a political magazine called Contre Champs and attached a video of his documentary to each magazine, selling 50,000 copies with the first two issues.  Rehov has been a movie producer, novelist, journalist and lawyer. But in producing documentaries that tell the truth about the Middle Eastâ€“ however controversial or dangerous â€“ Rehov has found his calling.     ",0

Reports in the press and postings on Islamic Web sites have said many Kuwaiti extremists have gone to Iraq to fight against U.S.-led troops. The government has not confirmed such reports.  Iraqi and American officials have accused some neighbors of Iraq of failing to prevent fighters from crossing their borders to join the insurgency that has bedeviled Iraq since Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) was toppled in April 2003.  In a meeting in Cairo on Wednesday, the neighboring states â€” Jordan, Syria, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait â€” responded to Iraq's plea for security assistance by agreeing to hold a high-level meeting to address the issue of cross-border infiltration.

"747","3855637","Government","       Well this thing keeps going, and unfortunately for the Democratic Convention, the most exciting part so far has been the Bill Oâ€™Reilly/Michael Moore Debate.&nbsp; And even that was a flop.&nbsp; Oâ€™Reilly didnâ€™t keep Moore on track, and Oâ€™Reilly wasnâ€™t as â€œpithyâ€ as usual.&nbsp; Moore kept pressing home that question of, â€œWould you send your children to Iraq to fight against a dictator?â€&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The answer to that question is a simple no.&nbsp; I mean Bill was on the right track by saying that he would sacrifice himself to fight the â€œ30 brutal dictatorsâ€ in this world, or would send himself to liberate and conquer Fallujah, but he didnâ€™t get the right point across.&nbsp; The real answer comes to me from the lessons my father taught me so long ago.&nbsp; Your children make up their own minds; they are their own people, so if they want to join the military, and take the chance at being sent to war and die in the process that is their choice.&nbsp; I would support them whole heartedly, but what parent in their right mind would send their child off into danger?&nbsp; I think Michael Mooreâ€™s question is getting old; he needs to find a new question to ask everyone.  On another noteâ€¦  I thought that John Edwards was the breath of fresh air that John Kerry really needed.&nbsp; Heâ€™s young, heâ€™s enthusiastic, heâ€™s charismatic, all of the characteristics that Kerry himself is lacking.&nbsp; Then after listening to him speak you realize just how little experience Edwards has.&nbsp;   He is a first term Senator, who most likely was not going to be reelected.&nbsp; His speech was nostalgic with his â€œTwo Americasâ€ theme that made him so famous and nearly won him the nomination.&nbsp; He of course tweaked this theme a bit to match the theme of the Kerry Campaign.&nbsp; What sets him out as inexperienced are his empty promises.&nbsp;   His speech last night was full of ideas which he did not (and probably cannot) back up with facts on how to carry out these ideas. &nbsp;How does this demonstrate his inexperience you ask?&nbsp; Well truth be told his campaign for Senate was evidently filled with these same types of empty promises.&nbsp; And because he did not follow up on these promises he most likely was not going to get reelected.&nbsp; See Edwards is a trial lawyer by nature, he knows how to talk the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk, he seems to falter a bit.&nbsp; I have to give him credit though, he is the nominee for Vice President, and he definitely has a lot of time to prove me wrong, he really could be the shining star.  Where he also fell short is that he just couldnâ€™t live up to his hype last night.&nbsp; Mainly because the Democrats allowed the Reverend Al Sharpton to hijack the national spotlight last night.&nbsp; He rolled into the Bush bashing, and went off on a tirade.&nbsp; I wonâ€™t really say more than he hijacked the stage and stepped off the agenda, not to mention his prepared remarks.&nbsp; I wonâ€™t say more than that, because mainly I have a personal dislike for Al Sharpton, and this is not the time to get into that, I will save that for another blog at another time. Speaking of hijacking this election, who exactly is running for president, George Bush and John Kerry, or their daughters?&nbsp; Although it would be interesting to see who exactly would win the popular vote in that category, Cate Edwards could definitely throw a wrench in everyoneâ€™s plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I digressâ€¦     ",0

"749","3849970","indUnk","                 I was going through some old emails I had saved, and found one from a guy I knew briefly a couple of years ago or so. A new job had moved him up north, and we lost contact. I decided to email him today, for some reason, only to have the message returned. The email address was no longer valid. Kinda bummed me out, as he was a really nice guy, and I wish I hadn't lost touch with him. Anyway, for some strange reason, I decided to Google him.  Well.  Imagine my surprise when Google found him. Or maybe I should say, found him and his wife. My search brought up a link to a photographer's website that had pictures from his recent wedding. May 1 of this year to be exact. One week before my 33rd birthday. I guess I should be happy it wasn't  on  my birthday...that really would have bummed me out, even more so than I already am. Seeing the pictures made me wonder what may have been if I had stayed in contact with him, you know? All the men I used to date, or just plain  used  (you know the ones, the sex buddies) are all off the market, either legally (married) or just  really  attached. Some even have kids.  &nbsp;  I never pictured my life this way - being single at 33.&nbsp; All I ever wanted was to be married. And be a mom. Maybe that sounds old fashioned, but that's the way it is. I just wanted to be a wife.&nbsp; Have someone to fall asleep next to, and wake up with. Someone who would take care of me, and I could take care of.&nbsp; Why isn't that in the cards for  me ? What's wrong with me?&nbsp; Seeing those pictures of this guy getting married really upset me. When is it   my   turn? Huh? When do  I  get to fall in love and get to wear the pretty white dress and flowers in my hair?  When I first heard the No Doubt song, 'Simple Kind of Life', I cried. I could have written that song. I felt like Gwen saw right into my head and heart with those lyrics.  &nbsp;   And all I wanted was the simple things    A simple kind of life    And all I needed was a simple man    So I could be a wife     &nbsp;   I always thought Iâ€™d be a mom    Sometimes I'd wish for a mistake    The longer that I wait the more selfish that I get    You seem like youâ€™d be a good dad     &nbsp;    &nbsp;  I find myself feeling lonely a lot. A lot more than I ever let on to anyone. If you are my friend, and you are reading this...well, there's lots of stuff you don't know. I don't tell everyone how I feel. It's especially hard to tell anyone how I feel when everyone around me is married, or getting married, or engaged, or moving in together, or having babies. . .etc.    &nbsp;  You know what I am? I'm a jar loosener.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Well, have you ever tried to get a jar open and tried and tried and couldn't, then handed the jar to someone else and they just popped it open, like it was nothing? And then jokingly, you say it's because you loosened it for them?  Well, men are like those jars. They need their 'lids' loosened before they're ready to take the plunge into marriage.&nbsp; It seems that the majority of the men I've dated in my lifetime have gone off and gotten married to the next person they've dated after me.&nbsp; So obviously I've&nbsp;loosened their lids!&nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;  What really gets me is the women who have a good man, and they either don't realize it, or they  do  realize it and don't care! They don't appreciate what they have, and either treat him disrespectfully, or take him for granted, or both! Or, worse yet, the nice guy has one of these women and he  puts up with her shit .&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp;&nbsp; What happened to being a man?  &nbsp;  Maybe it's just my fate to be alone. I mean, I've fucked up my share of opportunities. Mostly by being blind to my real feelings and then not realizing those real feelings until it was too damn late. It doesn't help that every time I seem to hit it off with a man, or am just attracted&nbsp;to one, they're either married or gay. I kid you not.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now what's really confusing me is having The Ex pop back into my life in the midst of divorce. I honestly didn't need that right now, as it has opened up all those feelings again. When he and I first broke up, my sister-in-law used to tell me that if The Ex and I were meant to be together, we would find our way back to each other, whether it be a week, a month, or  years  down the road. Well, guess what? It's years down the road and here he is, soon-to-be-single.&nbsp; I don't want to find myself falling in love with him all over again and getting hurt all over again. Oh, and&nbsp;what else? That sister-in-law has served my brother with divorce papers. See what I mean about women having a good man and not appreciating them?  &nbsp;  I really shouldn't be dwelling on this stuff. I mean, it's only going to upset me, and cause me to have what I call a 'depression session'. (I was diagnosed in February, and for the most part, the meds have helped and I've been doing really well.)&nbsp; I can't fall apart now - I have an appointment with my psychiatrist next week!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;         ",0

"752","3847931","Publishing","   The good people of the state of Missouri (or at least a plurality of the people who chose to vote in Tuesday's election) have decided to put an amendment in their state constitution to 'protect marriage' by defining it as a union between a man and a woman.  At the same time, a judge in Seattle ruled that Washington's ban on gay marriage was unconstitutional.  Both of the major Presidential candidates are against gay marriage (though Kerry, somewhat reluctantly, endorses the concept of gay civil unions.)  And the possibility of an amendment to the U.S. Constitution defining marriage as a union between a man and woman continues to be bandied about.  And I have to wonder why so many people are so threatened by the possibility of gay couples getting married. Why would what other people do in their lives and relationships have any impact on their own lives and relationships?  'The sanctity of marriage'? A good number of heterosexual marriages are undermined by abuse and infidelity and half of them end in divorce. Marriage has thrived in the face of these challenges and one has to believe that it will continue to do so even if same sex couples are allowed the right to legally walk down the aisle.  'Stability for the children'? Again, half of marriages dissolve in divorce (sometimes acrimoniously, sometimes not) and a large percentage of children grow up in 'broken' homes or blended families (myself, I grew up in a single parent home...hi, Mom!...and I turned out reasonably well...if I do say so myself.)  'The Bible says...'? The Bible also says that death (by stoning no less) is the penalty for adultery...it's easy to tapdance through the scriptures and make a case for anything you want. Using God to justify your own prejudices is, at best, disingenuous...and, at worst, baldly hypocritical and cynically manipulative.  Civilization won't grind to a halt if Martin and George...or Joanna and Karen...are allowed to legally wed and live happily ever after (or at least as happily ever after as any of us can.) If people of sound mind and caring heart want to share their lives with all of the benefits and sanctions of the law more power to them (this old world of ours could use more celebrations of love and life.)  We really should let that whole argument go so that we can once again turn our collective attention back to things which are  really  important to our society.  Like being outraged and/or...ahem...titillated by Janet Jackson's naked nipple.  ",0

"757","3839744","indUnk","            The Washington Post Michael Kinsley   Maybe I missed it, but it seems as if Laura Bush has not had her Lady Macbeth Moment. This is the period, hallowed by tradition if not actually written into the Constitution, when the media discover that the president's wife is the power behind the throne. She is not the sweet helpmate she appears to be. Underneath, there is steel. In fact, she is a (insert a word -- there are more than one -- beginning with 'b'). She is her husband's closest adviser and a fierce protector of his place in history. She curbs his partisan instincts or, alternatively, she keeps him on the ideological course. A well-known male rival for the president's ear has been fired on her instructions.  Rosalynn Carter, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush all had their moments. It was a challenge to fit Hillary Clinton into this template, but with a few little fixes (the demure helpmate stuff had to go), she was squeezed in. But when does Laura Bush get her turn? For almost four years she has loyally played along with the treacly conceit, assigned to her at the beginning of the administration, that her only public policy passion is libraries. As far as anyone knows, she has never questioned or failed to obey the instructions of the president's official advisers and spinmeisters. Of course, neither has her husband.  Then last week she suddenly popped off about stem cells. But this was hardly her breakthrough moment. A lot of Republican politicians and operatives spoke out about stem cells last week, all miraculously making the same argument -- an argument so embarrassingly silly and disingenuous that it could only be an official campaign talking point. Anyone thinking for herself would have a hard time getting it out without giggling.  As Laura Bush put it, George Bush 'is the only president to ever authorize federal funding for embryonic stem cell research.' She noted that 'few people know' this. Few may have known it, but many might have guessed. It is true indeed that Bush's predecessors, from George Washington to Bill Clinton, failed to fund embryonic stem cell research. Even Abraham Lincoln. Not a penny for stem-cell research from any of them. Historians believe this might have been because it didn't exist yet. But that's just a guess.  George Bush gave this nascent research a tiny sliver of money and piled on a smothering load of restrictions. As Laura Bush did not note, that makes Bush the only president ever to authorize federal rules against stem cell research.  It is characteristic of George W. Bush that he would not see, or have no patience for, the irony of justifying a policy on moral grounds and then, when it comes under attack, claiming that the policy is not having the very effect he is supposed to want. Meanwhile, it is characteristic of the Bush political machine to be utterly fearless about insisting that things are the way it would be convenient for them to be, despite all evidence that things are the way they really are.  The purpose of Bush's stem cell policy is to discourage medical research using embryos. Bush is supposed to think that these clumps of a few dozen cells are every bit as human as the people who will suffer or die from diseases that stem cells could cure. He had better believe that, because stem-cell research uses embryos being discarded by fertility clinics and doesn't actually add to the embryonic death toll at all. Only a deep conviction about the humanity of these microscopic dots -- which have fewer human characteristics than a potato -- could justify sacrificing real human lives to make the purely symbolic point that these dots are human too.  Scientists are in agreement that Bush's policy is succeeding. Stem cell research has been drastically slowed. Yet Bush surrogates now pretend that the policy's real success is its failure to stop this research completely. Hey! You're supposed to think all those embryos being used in privately funded research are human victims, remember? It's a huge tragedy, remember? Stop bragging about it.  In a display of her husband's famous compassionate conservatism, Laura Bush scolded that 'it really isn't fair to people who are watching a loved one suffer' to overplay the promise of stem cells. She said, helpfully, 'We don't know that stem cell research will provide cures for anything.'  As someone with a loved one (myself, as it happens) who has the disease (Parkinson's) for which stem cells hold the most promise, please allow me to say: Thank you so much, Mrs. Bush, for trying to make sure that I don't get too hopeful. While your husband and Sen. John Kerry make a major issue out of who is more optimistic, it is inspiring to have a first lady with the courage to say: Let's be pessimistic! Optimism is unfair!  But talk is cheap. While Laura Bush is destroying hope by the traditional method of spreading gloom and pessimism, her husband is bringing the pessimist's art into the 21st century by actually destroying the objective basis for hope. While she battles rhetorically against false hopes, he works to ensure that there is no hope at all.  On balance, I think I prefer her approach.           ",0

(Retired)            Well... being tackled and frisked in the entrance of the local Wal-Mart store sure is treating this individual with dignity and respect. And as far as making a difference, well my town now has a striking architectural land mark, the big aluminum sided Super Wal-Mart right off I-25, like a shining beacon welcoming you to our fair town. It's warm and comforting sight for road weary eyes no doubt. And it only attracts some of the most colorful people around including but not limited to; homeless people, prostitutes (yes, they truly have everything at Wal-Mart don't they?), sassy teens, punk kids, soccer moms, creepy old hermits like myself, midgets, carnies, and other assorted magical creatures. So, in a way, they have created a gathering place for all us suburbanite freaks, and they should be applauded for that in the least.  I just hate Wal-Mart.  Back to the check out aisle with our friend Kari. What angers me about this so much? Well, besides the fact she's obviously a little snobby brat and has an annoying high pitched voice and is probably popping pills to be so cheerful. Wal-Mart just brings out the worst in people. Maybe it's the bad florescent lighting, the stark warehouse interior, the soft elevator music, or maybe we are all just horrible people to begin with. On a trip to Wal-Mart one can always expect to see two soccer moms dueling it out over the last box of Captain Crunch, each fighting wildly for the coveted prize, mostly so their little Karis' can grow strong bodies and minds and live a fruitful life; Or because they will never hear the end of it if they don't get the box with the free Pokemon plush toy in it.   Of course one could catch me roaming the aisles of Wal-Mart on a regular basis, but where else is one to shop? My town has never had, and never will have a 'local grocer' or a 'mom & pop' set up, because they can't compete with Wal-Marts 'low, low prices,' they are just so hard to pass up. All I can say is, Wal-Mart has hit rock-bottom, and Iâ€™m not talking about their prices.   C. Vanderbilt   P.S. Despite it's evilness, I would kill to be a Wal-Mart greeter!            ",0

"767","3827628","indUnk","              urlLink  Most of the Mass was in the Chinese vernacular, although the sermon from Bishop Wang was in English. The Bishop spoke of the importance of appreciating God's gift of eternal life and creating new opportunities for evangelization. At the offertory, a Chinese lantern dance was performed by 13 girls, making what appeared to be slight curtsies to the left and right as they processed down the aisle holding lanterns; and, just in front of the sanctuary, several young women performed a Chinese ribbon dance.  After communion, Cardinal Mahony, Auxiliary Bishop Edward Clark, and Bishop Wang participated in an ancestral veneration ritual along with elders from the Chinese community. At the conclusion of the veneration, Cardinal Mahony stepped up to the podium to deliver two short New Year's greetings, one in Cantonese and the other in Mandarin. This met with much laughter and applause -- the first and last of the evening.    Aren't they going a little too far with 'acculturation'?  As a Chinese-Catholic, I think it's VERY inappropriate for them to have Dragon & lantern dancing during mass.  Outside of mass, I don't see a problem with it.  But during mass... HECK NO! Mass is a time to worship our Lord... to adore with BEAUTIFUL presence!  Also, I don't see how the Dragon and Lantern Dance has ANYTHING to do with a sacrifice!  The dances are celebratory rituals in the Chinese culture, which are TOTALLY INCOMPATIBLE with the sacrificial nature of the altar!  It's like Our Blessed Mother and the Beloved John DANCING at the foot of the cross!!!          ",0

"770","3822554","indUnk","       I'm looking for ideas. How does one have a summery day without spending too much time in the sun? Yesterday I spent the afternoon walking around Lund with Purba, Celia, Ola, and Emilie, Celia's cousin. The sun shone bright but I managed well. No buzzing and tingling or greater than average sunburn. Today what I'd really love to do is go to the beach. I don't want to sunbathe or anything crazy like that, I just want to sit there and read for a few minutes before dunking myself in the Ã–resund (the straight between Sweden and Denmark). The water temperature in MalmÃ¶ is warm and the sun is downright hot but I think I should stay away. After writing about phototoxicity, I started to do a little 'research' and found out that one disgusting side effect of doxyxycline-induced photosensitivity, is a possible separation of the finger nails from their pads.  So, the beach is out, at least until later afternoon or evening. Erik suggests we go to the maritime museum. I think maybe we should go shopping in thrift stores for a suit that he can wear to the wedding. Neither option sounds like a blast. At 7pm, though, we'll see a pop vs. hip-hop concert in the park, and that should restore the summerness to the day. Maybe we'll even have dinner outside. Then we can eat my leftover salsa from last night.  A few days ago I needed some mint for a recipe. At the farmer's market I had to buy a huge bushel or none at all. So, I've been forced to cook with mint much more than usual (actually, before this, I think I pretty much just stuck it in iced tea). Now I've made stuffed squash and haloumi with an olive-oil mint dressing (ooh la la), lemon and mint unchicken, ice cubes with mint leaves, and last night, something I was particularly proud of, due to its combination of ingredients rarely seen in my kitchen.   Amy's 'The First Time I've Ever Had Both Radishes and Mint in My Fridge' Salsa  ingredients: -radishes -some sort of ripe tomatoes (I used cherry) -spring onions (preferably ones with big bulbs) -mint leaves (oh you know, a small bunch) -lemon  Chop radishes, tomatoes, and spring onions into small pieces. Finely chop mint leaves and combine with veggies. Squeeze a lemon wedge over the mixture. Salt and pepper to taste.   Erik and I ate this as a relish for our burgers but I think it would also make a good bruschetta topping, or filling for hummus and pita. Now I have some of every ingredient left over in my fridge so I guess I'll make more. I mean, what else can I do with a few scraggly radishes, fastly wilting mint, a de-zested lemon, and three cherry tomatoes?    * See Laurie Colwin's great 'Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant.'

"773","3818223","Technology","             I have an idea that will make millions of dollars, but I need somebody with a little engineering skill to create it.  It's called the Flamesaw.  Anybody who knows anything about me knows my favorite recreational items are the flame-thrower and the chainsaw, so naturally I wondered how to combine the two.  I envision your standard two-stroke chainsaw with a couple of subtle changes:  1) a fuel tank strapped to your back, feeding both the engine and the 2) gas jets which will replace every other blade.  Now it will be blade, burner, blade, burner (or to your victims - cut, cauterize, cut, cauterize).  We need to jump on this one people.  Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas are coming and I don't want to look like a dufus.  At least, not an unarmed dufus.  BTW, if you're wondering how this will make us millions of dollars, I propose the following:  1) build the Flamesaw, 2) patent the Flamesaw, 3) approach a wealthy entrepreneur, and 4) inform him that if he does not give us millions of dollars we will cut/burn him to the ground.

"774","3818223","Technology","             I found a  urlLink blog  that posed the question 'If I knew that I could live well and fully for another 6 months.. and then I would just cease to exist, what would I do with my time?' I thought about this for a moment. Laugh? Cry? Commit suicide? Then the truth revealed itself to me: killing spree.  I know most people would go with something like 'Backpack around Europe' or 'Find true love,' but think about it. I'm guaranteed to live 'well and fully' for six months, which means I won't be going to jail or dropping in a hail of police bullets. Normally I have to face the fact that if I kill people, I might get into some kind of trouble. So that's my answer: 179 days of mayhem and violence, pillaging and plundering. To accomplish this, I think I'll need a horned viking helmet and a  urlLink Harley-Davidson   urlLink Fatboy  equipped with a scabbard on each side, one for my chainsaw and another for my flame-thrower.

Many people (Vietnamese and Americans) have suffered horrible effects from Agent Orange-- cancer, birth defects, etc. AA Men-- quite interesting comparison between AA Men and Af am women.  Chin's anger may be understandable-- but what are its implications?  If AA men feel excluded from patriarchy, then does aggressively trying to claim their share in it provide a viable answer?     Interestingly enough, alot of AA women complain that when AA men criticize them for going out with white men, the basis of the criticism is that AA women somehow are 'THEIR (i.e. AA men's)' women.  The AA men, in contrast, argue that it isn't a matter of patriarchy or sexism, but one of assimilation-- that AA women who go out with white men are 'selling out.'     Ironically, Chin himself has a white wife...And Bruce Lee, the icon of Asian masculinity, also married a white woman.  Is there a double standard here?  Or is it okay for Asian men to go out with white women because that's somehow breaking a stereotype, whereas the reverse simply reinforces it.

Yay volunteer military.  In this country though the volunteers are looking for a paycheck and status.  After years of repression and being nobody's they have the chance to help themselves and their families.  Seeing Americans fight is cool to them.  Sexy gear,  good weapons and tactics and we taught them how to do it and use it, BUT.  Now that they are receiving fire because we are around they don't want us around.  The local military now referred to as the Iraqi National Guard wants to conduct patrols on their own since every time we show up insurgents fire at them.  It's hard enough to get them to go out when we show imagine the vacation they will be on without U.S. troops egging them on.    The message this infant military is sending is that when the shooting starts they hide.  One of the first rules in an ambush is to charge the ambush.  Some always die but at least some will live.  The only exception are the Iraqi troops trained by Special Forces.  They have a confidence and ability none in this country's military can match.  Unfortunately a small percentage of their troops are S.F. trained.  When we had a police station overrun on the 24 Jun the Iraqi Police ran from their post due to,  apparently,  overwhelming numbers.  When the ING arrived to help us they were Professionals to the Nth degree.    In the U.S. and here in Iraq what must be explained to all potential soldiers is that,  now this is a stretch mind you,  YOU MAY GET SHOT AT IN THIS JOB.  The blame is not always on the soldier.  There is an old saying that goes 'Let no soldiers soul cry, 'Had I only been trained' '.  The promise of travel,  prestige,  and pay must be tempered with the reality of war.  The world military's are not places of social experimentation or easy employment,  or even college money.  I am going to shock you now but...WE MAKE WAR,  sorry.  The reward for defending your nation is pay and the like but that is our first order of business no matter what the recruiting posters say.  So in America as Iraq the Armed Forces and its recruits must be made to understand that we defend our nations and for doing so we give you pay,  prestige,  and college money.

"794","3798957","Student","           Okay, my first real post will be exciting and special. What a treat! We left Ted Stevens Int'l Airport at around 7:30ish. During all the associated lines before that, we were trailed closely by a woman and her baby. This instilled an early feeling of dread in my soul, because as everyone know, plane rides with babies are not any fun at all. Especially for me, because I  really  don't like children of any age. I was right of course, as the damned thing set up it's wailing almost on cue as we hit cruising altitude, and never stopped. Why does it have to be that the first thing to work good in kids are their lungs? Anyway, I stumbled out of the plane when we touched down in Chicago, where we were switching planes. There was  another  fucking baby on board this one. In fact, I'm pretty sure that of each of the five planes I rode on this trip, each one had at least one wailing child on board. I was not a happy camper, to say the least. The baby from Chicago to Grand Forks, ND provided some modicum of amusement at least. It was seated right behind me, not the amusing part by any means, but the interaction between it and it's mother was interesting. Apparently it had a bit of an obsession with hair, because at several points during the trip, the mother's voice would cut through the screams to inform it that, indeed, it  had  taken hold of mommy's hair and was hurting mommy. Every now and then these proclamations would be followed by a squawk and then renewed noise from the beast, along with 'you see? That hurts, doesn't it! That's what you're doing to mommy.' This made me smile because I knew that pain was coming to a creature whose existence displeased me. My elation was dimmed somewhat when I glanced behind me and saw the thing's eyes fixed on me, grubby paws extended and grasping feebly. I felt rather disgusted at the prospect of having the damnable thing sieze hold of my bare arm suddenly and then enduring the contempt-filled gazes of an entire plane as I immediately wrenched the hands away. The contempt wouldn't be so bad, I deal with that on an almost daily basis. Anyway, my family(the standard complement, a mom, dad, and brother.) and I arrive at the Grand Forks airport, where a local aunt comes and drives us to Valley City, home of my grandma. I have never met this aunt, nor heard mention of her that I can recall. While this may have worried most people, it doesn't faze me because I'm rather used to family cropping up unexpectedly. See, my grandma had 13 kids, including my dad, and most of them are also married with children, perhaps even grandchildren in a few cases. My mom's side of the family is comparatively much smaller, but with both of them combined I have the most cousins this side of Arkansas. Hell, I've got nephews, and I'm 16. But I digress. Over the hills and through the towns, to grandmother's house we went. Approximately halfway there, we stopped for gas and I bought a box of Krispy Kremes. We had an April Fool's day prank where someone put up a billboard proclaiming the arrival of these in our neck of the woods, Anchorage, Alaska if you've forgotton or didn't check, but this was the first time I'd actually seen them. Later that night I put a few in the microwave, and hot damn were they tasty. My aunt also spilled gasoline all over herself. This could be considered a bad thing, since she smokes. Thankfully, no immolation occured and we merely drove several miles crammed in a car with her fumey self. We got a warm reception at grammy's house, picked out bedrooms, and slept. I bet you're all pretty damn entertained, eh? I'll recount some more tantalizing tales for you later.         ",0

"796","3796743","Student","           Yikes, so yesterday I went to Canada. Vancouver, BC to be specific. But before Canada lets talk about bees. We have a really big travel trailer in our front driveway. Why you ask? I don't really know either. It used to be in a storage lot, now its in my driveway. Whatever. so, like where the refridgerator (sp?) is in the trailer there is like a vent thing on the outside. So about two weeks ago I noticed yellow jackets going into the trailer. We told my dad and he said he noticed that A MONTH ago but didn't think anything of it. So we call the exterminator and he says there is a HUGE nest in there cause its been a month. So yeah today he came and killed em all. Go Bee Men! Ya gotta heart them!  So back to Canada. This could be a really long blog today, but you all deserve it because I haven't posted a decent blog for a while. So Canada. We woke up at 5.30 in the morning and took off at about 7. I had to do my hair, this is why the delay. Anyways, we finally got up there at like 11 and basically drove right over the border. Apparantly the Canadians don't believe in security at all. The guy was like Hi, *glances at passports*, then says 'Have a good trip'. Well that was easy. Don't worry, we made up for it coming back into America. More on that in a bit. So the original plan was to spend the night in Vancouver, but as we quickly noticed, Canada sucks! There is nothing to do but shop, and while I can shop for weeks, we decided just to shop for one day. So we left the same day at about 4. Anyways after arriving we quickly located a large shopping mall (Pacific Center) I respelled Center because that is how its spelled. Don't even argue with me on that one. We shopped for several hours. I went to the Gap, which had all the same clothes as in America except it smelled funny. So I quickly left that dump. Then I located the Roots store, which I don't often shop at. I've bought online before, but I bought a sweatshirt. Its very cool. We also went to the pharmacy in Canada. They have Allegra over the counter and 222's. 222's are fun, and illegal. We didn't know that until we tried to cross the border back home when we were informed we were committing a felony. Yikes! Not fun. But everything turned out okay. So if you want the details you gotta ask me. Ummm....so today I did pretty much nothing. Except I had lunch at El Sarape and saw my hair stylist there. She was sitting in the booth right next to us! That is pretty exciting. What else.....I got nothing. So thats all for today kids. Remember that persons's profile I was talking about the other day. Well heres another quote from it. Have a good night all....

"799","3791552","indUnk","       On July 18, 1969 Mary Jo Kopechne drowned to death. She was involved in a car accident with none other than Edward 'Ted' Kennedy. Kennedy and Kopechne were at a party at Chippaquiddick, an area only a ferry's ride away from Martha's Vineyard.&nbsp; The two were attending a party when they decided to go for a ride. Somehow, the car crashed off of the Dike Bridge and landed in a tidal pond.   Twelve&nbsp;people were in attendance&nbsp;at this party, where Kennedy and the others had rented a cottage and were gathered for a cookout. All attendees claim the party was totally innocent,&nbsp;but five of the men were married (including Kennedy) and all six of the girls were single. The six women were working on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign the year before but were forced to quit in leiu of his murder.   Kopechne and Kennedy decided to leave the party to return to Edgartown just before midnight. Kennedy claims that he turned onto a gravel road by accident and lost control of the car, landing it in the pond. He says that he tried to rescue Kopechne but was unsuccesful and walked back to the party. He got his cousin Joseph Gargan and a friend of the family Paul Markham to go back to the scene of the accident for a second try.  The three men went to a ferry landing where spontaneously Kennedy dove in the water and swam across to Edgartown.   The two men were surprised to learn that Kennedy as of the next morning had not reported the accident yet, which they were sure he would have done the night before. Nine hours passed, and the accident had been reported by an uninvolved part when Kennedy came forward as the driver.   Kennedy attended the funeral with a neck brace that he was never seen wearing again. The Kopechne family refused an autopsy, with a check for about 150,000 dollars from the Kennedy family showing up in their account.   Rumors still circulate to this day that Kopechne had told Kennedy that she was pregnant shortly before the accident. This would make sense with the autopsy not being performed.   The events leading up to and after the accident have never been totally verified, and all of the partygoers gave officials varying stories.   The only thing I keep thinking about is that if she was pregnant, which I am pretty sure she was, that baby would have been around 35 years old today. I had heard about this accident and the death of Kopechne through the years, but had never really read anything about it. The implication that Kennedy did this on purpose is no big surprise to me. The Kennedy family has also been said to have killed Marilyn Monroe because she threatened to go public with her affair with JFK. Remind me to never get involved with a Kennedy, although that would be hard because all of the men (with the exception of Ted) seem to meet their demise very young.         ",0

"802","3785255","Advertising","             Oh, my poor neglected computer!  It's been so long!  A quick rundown of the things competing with the computer for my time:  I bought running shoes tonight.  Now I have to do some running.  I refinished the hardwood floor in my living room.  It looks suprisingly nice!  Goodbye dirty carpet!  My roommate moved out.  Now I have to put an ad up on Craigslist.  It worked well enough last time, but hopefully I can find someone who a) doesn't drink all my wine, b) doesn't smoke, even if it is just outside, and c) doesn't leave rotting food in the sink and fridge.  A dog is a bonus, so Juno has someone to play with during the day.  My car won't start.  I'd take it to someone, but -- well, I'd have to start it first.  Dang.  I really don't want to call a tow truck.  I bought a pasta maker.  Wow!  Homemade pasta isn't too tough to make, and it's pretty tasty.  This is fun.  I broke my record player's needle.  The poor guy has been sitting there, unplayed, for weeks now -- and when I do go to put a record on, I break it.  Gotta take it to the stereo guys at the store now, since I never figured out what's involved with aligning a record player needle properly.  Shoot.  I bought new molding for around the living room.  It's pretty simple -- just unfinished pine boards -- but now I have to stain and finish them.  Oh, and cutting them to the proper lengths is probably important.  Shouldn't be too hard, but it has been too hot out for me to want to be cutting boards and inhaling stain fumes.  My Apple Airport Express came.  It's fun!  I can play songs on the living room stereo from the computer in my bedroom.  Very cool -- now I can put something like 2 months' worth of downloaded music on random.  Only problem is that if iTunes is playing in the living room, I can't play anything in my bedroom.  I bought Beastie Boys tickets and David Byrne tickets.  Both should be good shows, but it's depressing that these are the only two shows I've had to look forward to in a couple months.  I need to check out more of the smaller shows around town, which I usually find more enjoyable anyway.  That might be about it... oh, I did do some laundry -- not normally a monumental task, but I had quite a pile going.  It took a while to get things under control.  Next up -- vacation planning.  Gotta take some time off and go somewhere, but where?  Portland would be a good idea, and then I could say hi to Ty.  Oh, and his birthday is coming up soon... almost sounds like a plan!

"804","3782878","Technology","       Today has been both eventful and uneventful. I woke up today and Pheonix and I had a wonderful miscommunication. One of those stupid little things that seem to be so important at the time yet when you look back at it you realize that you just need to grow up. Who cares who has the keys when your both going to the same place and why in the hell do when you put on your shoes really matter in the long run? Not a clue but this morning those things seemed to be at the top of my list of priorities. If I ever get a divorce or break up with Pheonix I want it to be about more than just shoes and keys on the table.   Besides the chatastophes of this morning I am working 17 hours straight today and into tommorrow. Today at Crieghton University's DOIT (Division of Information and Technology) we are holding GameFest, a bigger and better LAN party for all incoming sniveling whining bratty freshman that I hate more and more each day. I want to make a t-shirt that says, 'Please dont bring your 80's computer to Crieghton. It sucks and so do you.' My job today is to haul 5 plasma tv's and 40 Gateway computers three blocks across campus. My shoulders hurt, my arms have fallen off, I'm tired and I'm on break. I'm sitting here bitching in my blog about this and that and the other thing while random people are coming up to me. 'Can you fix my computer?' 'I cant get connected.' 'Where is the nearest wireless connection?' Dude I'm on break. Just because I work for DOIT does not meen that I like people. I tried to ignore them but then it seemed that they multiplied like mold on cheese. I want to charge money, $5.00 to see the on break DOIT person. I bet your asking 'how do they know you work for DOIT? Do you have a sign above your head?' Almost but not quite entirely unlike tea there. I have a big sign on my shirt. In large bold letters across my back and chest my shirt yells DOIT to the masses. I'm going to apply ducttape to it today. It's not even a nice colored shirt. It reminds me of a janitor or an industrial worker. I feel like I should be scrubbing toilets and not crawling around on the floor hooking cables into walls and explaning what a Desktop and a window is to estranged students. (Yes, that really happened I just got through talking to them. He wasnt even 50, he was a sniveling freshman.)  However I too have a tendency to digress as well and my break is over. More on the fantasies of DOIT later.  Ackron --- shoot the stupid people.    ",0

"808","3772159","Accounting","                 On Monday we rang my mum and Jims mum to see if they would like to come shopping with us and have lunch.  They both said yes so we picked my mum up as she lives over our way and met Jims mum at Garden City as she lives about 20km away in the opposite direction.  We got there and started looking at jewellery shops.  We started at Edments as that was who we had purchased my engagement ring from.  Another shop but that chain.  We went in and asked to look at wedding bands.  The girl did not seem to be awfully interested in serving us, and was not helpful at all when we realised that my engagement ring was an odd shape and we would need to have a ring custom made to fit with it.  (We tried a plain wedding band with it and it just looked ridiculous.)  They did not have any interesting mens bands there at all, only plain gold wedders and they were not at all cheap.  I think the cheapest was around $300 for a 9ct gold band.  We went to another 3 jewellers and although 2 had mens rings that interested Jim, we were having a problem finding anyone who could make my ring without it having to be sent out of the shop and to someone else.  This idea is not appealing to me as the more people handling the $1,800 ring the more likely it could get lost, stolen or damaged.  Ian Hill Jewellers could make me a ring onsite but I would have to wait 2 weeks until their jeweller got back from Bali before we could even look at a design or price range.  They had a quite nice mens ring and were the first jeweller that really showed any interest in us at all.  The girl there was incredibly helpful.  We decided to go to one more jewellers (I was just about over the whole ring hunting thing by then) and spotted Rosendorfs.  Now like Ian Hill, Rosendorfs is on the more pricy side of jewellers that you will find in a suburban shopping center.  This was immediately evident by the fact that we received immediate, good quality attention.  We looked at a large range of mens wedding bands and found a good 5 or 6 that looked really fantastic.  Then Mum spotted a two-tone gold band with a plaited rope design in the middle.  It was fantastic.  Jim tried it on and it just looked incredible.  So we got a card from the girl and then started talking about my ring.  She got a price range for my ring and said that it would cost about $385-$400 to make me a plain gold band in 18ct gold.  We went away to talk about it.  On Tuesday we decided to go and order both rings from Rosendorfs.  We had decided that Jim's was just perfect and we didnt want to spend too much time wandering around to millions of shops to find someone to make mine.  So we drive back to Garden City and go in and let Nicole know that we would like to order and pay for the rings.    Nicole got a crestfallen look on her face when we told her that we wished to order both rings.  Apparently after we left on Monday she had been told that the Rosendorfs policy was that they could only custom-make wedding bands to go with engagement rings purchased from them.  We decided to go ahead and order Jim's anyway (he has really small fingers and they don't have his size premade, it will take a month for the ring to be made in his size).  But this meant we were still going to have to look for my ring.  We had intended to go and do our gift registry list yesterday (can you see another post coming up?) so we didn't look at any more jewellery shops at the time.  We thought we were going to have to either go into the city or out to Maddington to get a ring made.  A lot of running around if you ask me.  Last night we went to Mum's to drop off one of the cats (another long story) and we were looking through her seniors discount directory and we noticed that the only jeweller we hadn't gone to in Garden City was the same brand as the one we thought we were going to have to go to in Maddington.  Could it be that they had a jeweller onsite there?  We decided to ring this morning and check.  We had to finish looking at items for the gift registry anyway so if possible we should try and get a ring at Garden City.  Jim rang Garden City Jewellers this morning and they said yes they had a jeweller onsite and all rings were made right there on the premises.  So for the third day in a row we headed over to Garden City.  (Have I ever mentioned that I really, really, really hate shopping and avoid shopping centres like the plague?)  We walked into the jewellers and I handed over my engagement ring to the girl on the counter who took it out back to show the jeweller.  She came back a moment later and asked if we would mind waiting while Erica (the jeweller) drew up a design or two for us to choose from.  We looked around the shop at the beautiful cuckoo clocks (hint, hint - if anyone feels like spending almost $500 on a wedding gift for us, we would love the cuckoo clock with the little people on it) and crystal ornaments.  After about 10 minutes, Carla (the assistant) came back out with two designs for us to look at and a price of $580 for either ring.  We were told that it would take about a month for the ring to be made up in 18ct gold.  We thanked her, got the quote written on a card and went to have lunch and discuss the matter.  After all, this price was a good $200 more than we had been quoted at Rosendorfs, but Rosendorfs only did that price if you purchased the original ring anyway.  After about 5 minutes discussion it was decided that unless we wanted to run around in circles looking at more and more jewellers that we should take this offer and run with it.  So we headed back to the jewellers (detouring on the way to add to the gift registry) and let them know that we would like to order the ring.  We were then asked which design we wished to have and how thick I would like the ring.  I had to hand over my engagement ring for the duration of the making of the wedding ring and asked how long it would be before I could have it back.  Carla said she would check with Erica how long she would need the engagement ring for.  She came back with the fantastic news that the ring would only take 2 weeks to be made.  So we paid for the ring, left my engagement ring (I feel totally naked now) and went off to do the gift registry thing.  Cross another item off the list.  Rings are ordered and paid for.      ",0

"810","3770708","Student","       The night before last, we found Sumo Toad helping himself to cat food in the kitchen, so we chased him out and hoped he had not eaten any of the poisoned roaches which had been staggering around. Yesterday, we noticed a foul odor lingering in the kitchen. We snooped around the trash can for a dish of cat food that may have escaped us, but found nothing suspicious. We worried that a toad may have crawled under the stove and died of indigestion, we speculated that perhaps some large roaches had perished in the walls. It wasn't until today that I learned the terrible truth.   The smell was worse than ever. I took out a plastic bag and began loading the few items of recycling that were loitering around the garbage can. As I reached under the kitchen stool to pick up an innocent wine bottle, I realized I had hit paydirt. The green bottle lay on it's side, and as I picked it up, a putrid layer of black sludge slopped down in it. Through the dark glass, I could see wriggling. Horrified, I ran a bit of water in it to loosen the sludge, and, holding the reeking vessel at arm's length, carried it out behind the old tree and dumped it. What I found would have amazed and delighted any entymologist.   The maggots were huge and grey, wriggling and fat amidst an astounding collection of cockroach parts. There were the wings of at least a dozen full-sized tropical roaches. Presumably, they crawled into the bottle in search of the teaspoon or so of wine within, perhaps to quench a thirst induced by the poison. Perhaps there were fleeing the Sumo Toad. Twelve or fifteen of them crammed in atop each other and, unable to escape, died. All afternoon, my mother and I have been lured behind the tree by morbid fascination to peer at the squirmy pile. We can't see why the maggots haven't been eaten by the birds and praying mantis, but they have begun to change color, becoming a translucent orange. Some have already produced tiny flies, and the odor is overpowering. I have included a picture, in which you can see the maggots if you look closely. I can't begin to count the wings. Imagine, if you will, the sickening stench of rotting flesh as you examine it, for full effect.   This process has been an unusual way to overcome my fear of roaches, I must say.          ",0
"811","3770588","indUnk","                 As anyone who follows politics (or really anyone who occasionally watches or reads the news) knows, John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate.  I think this reveals an interesting flaw in John Kerry's character.  Instead of choosing Dick Gephardt, who would have made a better Vice President, he chose Edwards, who looks better on TV and has more energy.  Why would Gephardt have made a better VP you ask?  He has YEARS of experience in government.  This man has been a member of the House of Representatives since 1976.  Edwards has not even served a full term in the Senate.  Gephardt knows the issues and can make reasonable, coherent arguments in favor of his positions.  Edwards used generalities and the 'Two Americas' theme to gloss over important issues during the primary.  Gephardt can help deliver Missouri, which is swing state that voted for Bush in 2000, and he is very close with the labor unions, which can help in persuading America's workers that Kerry would be better for the economy.  North Carolina (Edwards' home state) is safely in the Bush column and the only group Edwards is close with is the trial lawyers, who are liked by Americans about as much as tax collectors.  Why is this important?  Because Kerry is hoping that Edwards will bring 'excitement' to his campaign to make up for Kerry's lack of charisma.  On the day of the announcement, EVERY Democrat that got near a microphone used the word 'excitement' in explaining the decision.  They didn't say ANYTHING about his actual ability to be VP, or more importantly, the President.  Energy is important and I do like candidates and politicians that can make me feel good about my government, but when it comes to making real decisions, I'd rather have someone who makes the right decision than someone who excites me about the wrong decision.  Kerry chose to make someone next in line for the presidency who is not qualified for the position.  It shows that he'll do anything to win despite the consequences.             ",0

Also, one of our clients has 400 e-mails that are older than we need them to be. And the bigwigs wants us to have them done by Monday (yes all of them). And he said that we're up for contract negotiations with them pretty soon and this is not the time to fall behind. Problem? Ha! I thrive on this kind of pressure. And it's nice to work on something besides Chick-fil-A. I work till 9:30, I'm home at 10:30, in bed after 11, and up at 5 for work. Oh, and somewhere in between, I run into the biggest mistake of my 24 years. Oy, what the hell was I thinking? I am way too tired to deal with him. And Saturday, I leave for work before the sun comes up and I am the first to arrive. At least it'll be a normal day though. No overtime today.  &nbsp;  The day goes by quickly enough and I get to leave at 3:00. YAY! And Seth gets to my place around 4:15. YAY Again!! We head down to the Mall of Georgia (yes, that's the mall's actual name) and get some very fattening spicy chicken at this Cajun place in the food court. We then head to the Mall's movie theatre and see 'I, Robot.' Fabulous movie, by the way. It was very intense and you got to see Will Smith's butt. It was also a little disturbing, but all in all, it was a great use for my money. Then, we went shopping to my favorite store in the universe, Charlotte Russe. Could the shorts get any shorter?? Seriously, who has the body for that crap. Seth and I had a great time trying to figure out what items were tops and which were bottoms. . . sometimes it was a little tough to figure that out. But I did find a great dress and a great top to wear to work. I also found a cute new purse. And I had a $100  gift  card that I had gotten for Christmas, so I didn't pay for any of it. We then leave the store and head to Cinnabon for a fattening snack. For those of you who are unaware, Cinnabon is found in malls and sirports and there desserts are so bad that they don't post the nutritional information on their website. However, because my company also does customer service for them, I do have access to that information. Because of that, I get the low-fat strawberry minibon (probably has a million grams of sugar). I had never tried one before and I never should have. . . it was  soooo  good. I also had a bite of the really fattening one that Seth got, which probably contained about 300 calories (seriously). Then Seth and I head to Barnes and Noble for some book browsing, one of our favorite pastimes. We spend about an hour and a half in there. I decide to buy an Idiot's Guide to Investing. My company has an investment plan and I might as well take advantage of it while I'm still there (seriously, I do  not  want to be there for much longer).&nbsp; And can you imagine it. . . me buying stock? I am  such  a grownup! I also bought Michael Moore's latest masterpiece, 'Dude, where's my country?' I read the introduction and I'm already hooked! I love him so much. Hmm. . . maybe this would be a great birthday present for my father. Hehe. And now the sugar from my minibon has caught up with me. Migraine time. Since I went on my health kick, I'm not used to eating that much sugar at a time. Fat maybe. . . sugar no. We head back to my place and I get Seth to finish pumping air in my balance ball cause it was a little too mushy. We watch some Mad TV, I lay down, and I pretty much pass out.  &nbsp;  The best part of the ENTIRE day?? I do NOT move for 8 and 1/2 hours! Woo-hoo! I feel wonderful!! While I'm waiting for Seth to awaken, I watch Jessica get laser eye surgery on Newlyweds (so weird) and then I watch about 4 episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210. It's so weird to see Jason Priestley circa 1993. How old were they back then? 30?? Seth finally awakens at 11:30, we eat and get ready to head to his  car  thing. We get there and it's pretty awesome. Seth gets to drive a BMW, a Subaru, and a Volvo on 3 different courses. And the object is pretty much to go as fast as you can. My God, Seth knows how to do that. We were actually riding on 3 tires a couple times. Actually, I think we were riding on 2 at one point. It was awesome though. I didn't really want to drive, even though I could have. Like Seth said, 'Cindy likes riding.' Hehe. After that, we decide to go eat Mexican. The host and waiter are so hot and we are distracted. Then we come home and it's time for Seth to leave. Damn. I watch some TV. I also have this '10-minute Clutter Control' book. I'm attempting to Feng Shui my life. And apparently, I learned that clutter on your nightstand can confuse your love life and disturb your sleep. Hmmm. . . so  that's  why I'm alone and tired. I did manage to de-clutter my desk and my nightstand. We'll work on the rest later. Whatever, like anything's going to change. Right now, I need a massage. I have this huge knot right under my shoulder blades that's been building for about a week. It's very painful. I'm also very sleepy. I may go to bed now. Don't expect a blog from me anytime soon. . . I'm working 12 to 12 for the next 3 days, so I'll be unavailable. Check in on me to make sure I'm still alive!         ",0

The game looked really fun, and it was  free , so that really caught my eye. One hell of a big file, though. 736 MB! I had to leave my computer on all night to download it.  It was  so  worth it.  The game is downright awesome, but the folliage is a little, well... 'Flat'. By that, I mean it's 2-D. Most games are like that, though. Oh well.

We had a pleasant surprise when we got to the movie theatre and discovered that on Tuesdays, all day, the price of admission is only $4.00.  Woo hoo, we felt like we had won the lottery {{giggles}}.   It was a good movie and rates a 7 on the entertainment factor.  It was a little disappointing for an M.

Because I'm lazy, I couldn't be bothered, and 'today I slept all day' isn't exactly riveting for either of us.  Anyways, there's been some actual progress in my life, which shocks me greatly. Because of a lack of attendance (either because I ended up sleeping all day because I only got an hours sleep that night, or just because I couldn't be bothered turning up) and just plain having not handed in any quality work (I've been everso slack, accursed internet!) my year at school is pretty much on the verge of 'you fail!', and with little chance of recovering it. So, I'm signing out of school tomorrow, spending the rest of the year doing random crap, and doing my HSC equivalant at TAFE next year.

"825","3751152","Technology","          CamdenTown is a part of London which became famous in the sixties and was a regular hang-out for lotsa rock stars. Since then it's become a place which attracts all manner of freaks (as well as plenty of tourists) coming to embrace Camden's alternative feel and shop in the markets. So I guess it was only natural that my first encounter with Camden would be at a TCZ meet back in 1997.  Well 7 years on here I am living in Camden - having been here for over a year and much as I love where I live, there's one small part of Camden that REALLY riles me up. It's a small stretch of road starting at Camden Tube and progressing about 200-300 metres up towards Camden lock. This is where the markets are and many, many shops selling things like clothes, shoes, tattoos and food (including magic mushrooms). And it's on this small stretch of road that a large number of people descend every weekend - so many people that they have to close Camden tube on a Sunday to make it exit only.  Now I don't mind lots of people, I've had to catch the tram back into Manchester after a United match with about 40,000 other people. What really annoys me is people who seem to have an inability to walk properly or to be aware of everyone around them. These people seem to meander on at a snail's pace obvlivious to those of us who just want to get home. They stop randomly in large groups which means you have to walk in the road just to get past them. Or they decide to stagger themselves right across your path and have a discussion about which shop to go in. They stop to take photos, with the photographer standing like 2 metres away from the photographee and then getting stroppy when people walk in the way. So I'm pretty frustrated by constantly having to negotiate this slalom course of idiots and I'd imagine they all think I have tourettes with the amount of evil glares and muttered curses ;)  And then, when I've just about made it to Camden lock I have to endure the drunk punks, the leafleters, the weed salesmen and today a nice man selling what initially looked like cakes his grandma had made - how sweet I thought, having only baked some fairy cakes myself yesterday. Well, I'm sure you can guess, these cakes would have you seeing more than fairies! His selling slogan was 'Hash cakes - get seriously fucked up for only a pound'.  So welcome to my world, and the small part of it that can seriously piss me off within seconds. But much as I hate this part of Camden, I know one day I'll be grateful when I'm going to a fancy dress party where the theme is goth/punk/freak - I know I'll definitely be able to get an outfit ;)           ",0

Maybe you've heard a movie named 'the terminal', or maybe not. Anyway it's such a great movie that you probably will remember it forever after seeing it. A man, Victor, endures a lot to keep his promise, and finally makes it happen. Well what he's trying to do may be so worthless (or even insane) for some others, just some pieces of paper in a rusty can. But for Victor, that's what supports him to fight. When I was watching, I thought this man must be so mentally strong. But to him, it's just two simple words: 'I wait.' Stories about heros (sometimes they are called by those that couldn't understand them 'coward') often move me into tears. King Arthur and his knights fight for the belief in freedom, in their land, and in their people. Victor, the one more down to earth, finds his chance to do what he means to do.

"840","3735380","Student","       The RIAA has been milking money out of customers and downloaders for over half a year now. Can you believe it?  But is it really the RIAA who is being cheated, or is it us?  Look at it this way. It takes at most $1 to stamp a CD, with its plastic case. To put the paper catalogs and stuff, it should be about $1 extra. The total comes to $2, or at most $3 per CD. So why are we paying $20 per cd? They should at most charge about $5 per CD.  Or at least they would. If they had a major competitor.  Their unreasonable pricetags like $19.95 or whatever is completely insane. First they charge 3 hours of earnings on your paycheck, then they start suing people.  Here's the situation. The RIAA has no major competitor. They can raise their prices to about $25 or $30 if they wanted to.  This is why you see McDonalds next to Burger King. Walmart across the street from K-Mart. The BP station about 10 feet away from the Shell station. Capitalism is a world of competition. The rule is to sell the best goods at the lowest prices.  The RIAA does not follow that rule. Instead, they have tiny similar companies that are almost bankrupt that are competing against them. In fact, they can even sue without losing customers, because the customers have nowhere else to buy music from.  The situation is that unless someone steps up to compete, things are going to get worse.  Leave your comments. I dare you.    ",0

"844","3732803","indUnk","                 Something We Neglect  With many moves behind me, I have come to realize the one most important thing that is lost the most are friendships. We tend to create good friendships in places that we are but when the stress of time and distance are placed on these 'frindships' the friendship tends to fall apart. As much as we would like to think that we are going to continue our friendship over the distance that is placed between us, the reality of it may be different.  Many times I have moved from one place to antother with a 'good bye' card in my purse. On that purse are the names and envelopes of those 'friends' that I want to keep in contact with. These are also the friends that want to contanct me, 'when they are in town.'   Time goes by as new jobs, school, family, just life in general zip by you. Before you know it, there are weeks that have passed and the friend that you couldn't go a day without talking to, has not called. Nor have you called them back. We seem to neglect what is important to us. It seems easy to neglect what is not right there at our disposal. Our vision of life  becomes so blured with what is right there in front of us, we forget to see those standing on the side lines of our life.  Our friendships become former and our lives are now filled with playing phone tag and listening to phone messages about the lives of our friends. We want so much to be there and yet can't even seem to find the time for a simple phone conversation to say, 'Hello, I miss you.'      ",0

"846","3732803","indUnk","                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I learn best by doing things myself and knowing what they are like. If I do not do things for myself, I will always wonder what the harm is in them. I have not lead a wild life full of drugs and parties, but I have had my own struggles with my inner self and the need to experience life on my own. At the age of 18 I promptly moved out of my parentâ€™s house to a town that was 3 hours away. In this town I was only knew two people. One was my ex boyfriend and the other was a â€œfamily friend.â€ I moved in with the family friend who allowed me to stay out all night and do whatever I pleased. I smoked, did some drinking, and experimented with many other aspects of life. In retaliation to my strict upbringing, I got my nose, tongue, eyebrow, and inner ear pierced, along with multiple tattoos. Through the years, from these experiences, I know that I donâ€™t need my piercing to express myself, my tattoos remind me or my experiences, and I know that I am okay with who I am. I donâ€™t feel that I would be as sure of myself without experiencing these things.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband on the other hand, has learned a lot of his lessons through taking example from his sisters â€œroughâ€ life. Through seeing her do the things that she has done such as drugs, alcohol, and partying, he decided that those things in life were really not that important. He is what I refer to at â€œstraight laced.â€ He tell me that I am the kind of person who has to touch a hot pan to make sure that it is hot even if someone tells me it will burn.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things to be learned from others, and many to be learned by trying things out for oneself. Not everyone is as lucky as I was to be able to stop my destructive life and learn from it. However, when I look at my husbandâ€™s life, I think that some people would be bored with it. Some people end up ruining there lives by testing the hot pan as I have and would have been better off to learn from others experiences.       ",0
"847","3732803","indUnk","       Within the essay, â€œIn The Gardenâ€, written by Deb Sullivan, there was a statement that I feel has great significance in my life. â€œI realize that I want to do for Jake and Ben as I do for the plants in my garden. I want to plant them in my world tenderly care for them, helping them to grow healthy and strong. I want to build a fence around them and protect them from the harsh elements of life.â€ It would be so much easier as a parent to be able to protect our children from anything that hurts or disappoints them. If we could only create a perfect little world for our children filled with love, happiness, success and good fortune. &nbsp;  As a parent of a child with â€œspecial needsâ€, I have found this statement to be true so many times. I have had to stand back and watch my son be disappointed, rejected and taken advantage of. I have watched him try so hard to be just like the other kids but never quite succeed. I have watched him fill out job applications with miss-spelled words and almost impossible to read handwriting, because he wanted to do it all by himself. I have watched his disappointment when the phone did not ring for an interview after all the time spent filling out those applications with the miss-spelled words and the messy handwriting. I have watched him stand in the doorway of the dugout cheering on his baseball team because the coaches would not put him in the game because all they were thinking about was winning. I have listened to the excuses he made for them saying, â€œItâ€™s okay. There just wasnâ€™t enough time for me to get in the game mom.â€   &nbsp;One day I went to pick my son up at school for a doctorâ€™s appointment, he came out of school with different clothes on than he had left the house with. When I asked him what  happened, he informed me that when he got back to his gym locker, his clothes were gone. He had to get dirty clothes out of the lost and found to replace the ones that had been stolen from him. I asked him how that could have happened if he had locked his locker. He said, â€œI couldnâ€™t get the lock to work so I laid it on top of the locker where it would be safe. I didnâ€™t want the guys to have to wait for me.â€ He knew I was upset about his missing clothes. He tried to comfort me by saying, â€œItâ€™s okay mom, someone else must have needed my clothes.â€ He was so forgiving. Somehow he always finds the positive side of any situation.  As parents, it is our nature to want to protect our children from hurt and disappointment. However by allowing them to experience the hurt and disappointment, it helps them learn to be better people. Our son is compassionate, forgiving and full of never-ending love. He is not judgmental or prejudice. He accepts people for what they are. He survived the harsh elements of life.&nbsp;           ",0

WEDNESDAY:   sat around most of the day. i started to watch braveheart at night (excellent movie i might add) but then liz came over with her new puppy so we walked it back to her house and hung out there for a while until i went home. then i finished braveheart. then i slept. oh yeah and i also found out that IM GOING TO FRANCE. i got into the excharge trip. im so excited. i really didnt think id go bc 10 my teacher was not my biggest fan. we did not get along. shed be super duper mean to me so id do stuff to piss her off, and then still get Bs on most everything so she couldnt complain. and  2) ill only be a sophmore next year and they usually dont take that many sophmores and theyre taking at least four that i know of (me, amy, liz, and this girl allison i dont really know that well but my mom said i used to take ice skating with her). i really hope i get a boy. that would be wickedly awesome. THURSDAY:   now im pretty sure i didnt do much that day. except in the afternoon. then i went to the nursing home to play with the old people. it was fun. theyre really nice. i played scrabble with these two ladies. it was cool. old people are super-duper fun and theyre really neat to talk to. after that i went to dinner and then i took a jazz class with my sister. ive never taken jazz before but the teacher told me that since ive done ballet since i was 3 i could probably start in the second highest level if i decided to take it next year. i think im going to. but if i do that means i will be taking 5 classes a week. i got into the highest levels of ballet (3, 3/4, and 4) plus ill be doing 4 on pointe, and the highest level in modern. picking up a jazz class would be really hard, but also a lot of fun. i dont really know what ill do. hmmmm... something else to think about. oh well. ya know as i think back i really did a lot on thursday. hehe FRIDAY:   now i did a lot on friday. SIX FLAGS!!! i went with amy and liz. it was so much fun. we went on all the good rides twice and even waited for the front row on bull, batman, and superman even tho superman isnt that great of a ride. also there was this really fun spinning ride that we went on in the afternoon and then came back to at nite. at nite we rode it once, and then got off, grabbed our stuff, ran around the ride, got on and had to re put our stuff in the bin to ride again. after that time the really hot guy who was running it let us go again even tho it was 9:15 and the park closed at 9. if anyone ever comes to great america they have to go on it. its called the revolution and is right across from the american eagle. liz also talked me into going on the rapid ride. BIG MISTAKE!!! i was wearing these beige cargo capris and they got soaked and turned see through!!!! i had to walk around with my sweatshirt around my waist so no one could see my underwear. it was a pain. i lived tho. it was a fun day. i love theme parks. so much fun. SATURDAY:   i slept late. then got up. watched spiderman but then i had to get dressed because i was taking a ballet class. took it. then i had to go help pack up at my moms craft show. boring. then my family went over to amys house because they invited us to dinner. it was fun. they have a trampoline so we got to jump. and then we watched the real world marathon (last episode tues!!) im strangely addicted to that show. i love it. hehe. not much else happened. a slow day. TODAY:    i had to drop my sister off at camp today. itll be interesting to see how this goes. she gets horribly homesick. uh oh. i hope she does okay tho. i feel kinda bad for her councilors. i went with her to a camp last year, and she cried every night. it was horrible. and of course she wants to go away again. shes crazy. i have to remember to write her. i tend to forget things like that. hey for now im and only child. YAY!!!! ha  well thats life for now. rock on.    ",0
"869","3706096","indUnk","           The video â€œGame Over,â€ was at best an entertaining program.&nbsp; It focused in upon a small by sensational segment of the multi billion dollar computer entertainment market.&nbsp; Providing only one prospective of computer gaming culture, the video is unforgiving placing blame directly upon the developers of the games.&nbsp; Regardless the video overlooked the huge segment of computer games that are non-violent and disregarded the market successes or failure of the games addressed in the video.  The successes or failure of a game motivates the market to adjust.&nbsp; A super successful game will cause other game developers to attempt to develop a better version of a similar concept.&nbsp; Failure will and has caused entire genres to disappear from store shelves.&nbsp; Another point the video did not address is that other media is also becoming more realistic and more explicit in depictions of violence.&nbsp; Even in sports, the camera seems to zoom in closer rather then pan out when a player becomes hurt.  News media and some academics have always found fame in looking at fringe behavior and addressing it as if it is the norm.&nbsp; In the mid 80â€™s the television program 60 minutes did a report on the evils of the roll playing game Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp; In that report the program presented several stories of individuals who took the concept too far attempting to practice magic, worship devils, etc.&nbsp; It is true, Dungeons and Dragons may be a criminal waste of time, but very few individuals actually attempt to bring the fantasy world into reality.  The maddening fact of this sort of reporting is that the reporters seem to think that rather then presenting the story evenly, that the public needs to be lead in the proper direction.&nbsp; This act of leading peopleâ€™s options may have worked well in the past, but will people continue to tune to such news shows when time after time the stories are so one-sided? I think not.          ",0

"874","3696530","Communications-Media","   I've been listening to a few CD's slapped into my discman tucked into my shorts while packing, moving and otherwise feeling like one of the most disorganized people on the planet. Our apartment is in total chaos, and split between two locations.   Lets put it this way. Breakfast today, consisted of a Bounty chocolate bar.    1.  Much Dance 90's     (2 disc set)     (MuchMusic Compilation,  Various Artists,   2003, Sony Music)    Okay, okay, have I dated myself enough? Yes, yes I have. It's all the dance music hits from when I was in early highschool, but it fucking rocks. I mean,  'Ice Ice Baby'   by  Vanilla Ice?!  (I can actually rap the whole damned thing. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I just know I can.) Or  'Mr. Vain?!'  Or  'Hip Hop Hooray'  by  Naughty by Nature?!  I have to love a song with the line, 'She's as hot as a baker, 'cuz we're Naughty by Nature.' Seriously! Awesome.   I mean, how dorky am I, when my cell phone ringer right now is  'Bust A Move'  by  Young MC . (That, or  'Safety Dance'  by  Men without Hats , or  'Hey-Ya'  by  Outkast .)    2.  Pulp Fiction Soundtrack    (Various Artists)    Old movie. Older music. Classic Motown, Funk. Gorgeous. As much personality as Quentin Tarantino puts into his character dialogue, I usually skip past the talking parts. This is the CD I first heard  'Son of A Preacher'  by  Dusty Springfield  on, about 10 years ago, that I do at Karaoke, which has earned me the title of 'Mizz Motown.' (That, and  'Respect'  by  Aretha Franklin. )    3.  Great Big Sea, 'Up'    (Warner Music, 1995)      Good ol' Newfie tunes. Classic Canadiana. And it reminds me of my Grandpa. Fun to belt along with, Fun to bounce around the apartment to, and even more fun to drink to at the  Blarney Stone.     4.  Be What You Are.    (Various Artists)    A Christmas present from Devin. Some great tunes. Check out  urlLink his Blog ,  he's got a listing of what's on there in the ' urlLink Be What You Are ' link. Or, just click that one right there cuz' I had to do some searching to find it.    5.  Madonna, Greatest hits, Volume 2.    (Maverick Recording Company, 2001)   Mostly Madge's new stuff, but the GOOD new stuff. I'm a big Madonna fan, I blame my mother for that. Even if I can't sing  'Like a Virgin'  at Karaoke with a straight face. (Touched for the very first time! *Hah!* First time?! Oh, like a vir-er-er-er-gin....)     It has my all time Fave madonna song,  'Music.'  It usually makes me ride the barstool at the club one hand gripping the seat between my thighs like a pommel, and one circling over my head with an imaginary lasso in slow motion. Yeah. It's a hot song.    6.  Massive 2002    (Various Artists)    A collection of dance/trance/hip-hop/pop on one cd that I borrowed from Crystal D. Has everything on it from  'Sandstorm' by Darude , to a remake of  'Ordinary World' by Duran Duran  but sung by a woman, some dance versions of Salsa tunes, and the song  'The Summer.'  (I don't know who does that one, but I LOVE it.) This was the CD that we popped into her CD player in her Ford Escort Z2X, and zipped about Vancouver in two summers in a row. It Rawks.   Good songs to move by.   You can dance, you can dance. Everybody take off your pants... (And yeah, I know the lyrics arent actually that. It's just way funnier that way.)      ",0

"877","3692032","Communications-Media","           May 8 Last weekend I went on a trip to phoenix with my phys ed teacher Mr. O and about 12 kids from my school. The other kids were there to take the PT Test with 100 soldiers, and I came to video-tape it. Apparently I am very good with the camera.  During our stay we had to eat MREs, (Meals Ready to Eat). If you have never heard of these, your lucky. They are preserved meals that are packed in heavy plastic and are supposed to last 5-10 years on the the battlefield. I have a feeling that they are kept around longer... Eating the MREs were quite an experience.  It was a fun trip, except we only had two chaperones. We were staying at the home of the Uncle of our PE teacher. He was a nice old man. But *Mr. O* actually thought that having the guys sleep outside and the girls sleeping inside would work out. The only thing separating us was a sliding glass door. I stayed where I was supposed to, but lets just say that 2 of my friends did not.  We were staying an hour away form the base, so we had to get up at 3 am every single day to make the drive and be at the base at 5 am. It was the kind of trip where you hurry-up-and-wait. We spent near;y 3 whole days hanging around at the base. Mr.O had duty with the ARMY, so it was just our one chaperone, *Cindy* and our PE tecaher MR O*'s girlfriend.  His girlfriend came in their personal truck. Last time they were in Phoenix she rolled it down an embankment. But she insisted that we get out of the base and go somewhere. So kids had to ride with her, in the back of a half smashed pick up.  I refused ot ride with her, and rode with Cindy*. We went to Freestone Skate Park, and I think I got enough footage their to make a skate video. Thats gonna be awesome. We spent all day their, then went back to base to get Mr.O, and went to the house.  That night we were really bored so Lyle (I can't remember what fake name i gave him...) decided to do his twin brother Peters hair. Peter has long hair that he usually wears ina mohawk. We spiked up huge and then heard we were going to the Metro Center Mall in Phoenix.  This was fun because while we all walked through the mall, everyone stopped and stared at Peter's hair. It was hilarious. ah-gtg-mom's home cant finsh this post she doesn't know why mr o is being investigated----         ",0

"882","3689246","indUnk","   THE ENORMOUS RADIO John Cheever's language is simply great. The first sentence is proof of that, for it is also in that statement that the reader is given a hint of the Westcott couple: they 'strike that satisfactory average of income, endeavor, and respectability...' But by so consciously stating they are average, the text already says that they are actually not. This we see in their encounter with the peculiar radio.  The story ends with how the Wescotts end up becoming exactly like the people they heard over the radio. Irene, who after listening, got so worried about life being sordid, also became like the people she did not want to become.  One last thing about 'The Enormous Radio,' the dialogues are wonderfully constructed. Cheever makes it all sound so real.  THE REMEMBERER The first thing that struck me about the story was the humor and originality of the whole concept of a reverse evolution. Well, I never thought of that, evolving   back   in time. Evolution of course, is a forward thing, how something becomes more complex to adapt to a changing environment. In this story, Ben evolves back in time, taking every form the human being must have passed before reaching his present state.  The tone is the exact opposite of the story's content. And well, it is precisely there that I was able to fully appreciate the craft and wit with which the story is wrought. The story is superficially funny,  but the tone is serious and melancholy. The sad tone perfectly complements the comical situation of a reverse evolution. ",0

This was the secondary story in the 'Technology' section of the BBC news website. Now, maybe this is just my cynicism creeping through, but what exactly is the point in this technological advance?   We have people dieing in the developing world from famine, war, disease, drought, landmines and a myriad of other nasty things, and yet here in the priviliged west we are investing out time and money into advances such as this. Now, the news article does make very clear that this is nothing but a showing of technological prowess, and far be it from me to criticise the developers for wanting to show of what they can do, but at another point in the article they stress how difficult it was not upsetting the balance of the surfboard. Now this is all very well, but why not try investing some of this time and effort into something a little more worthwhile?         ",0

"891","3678112","Student","       Source: Gamspot For fans of Team 17's venerable Worms--a long-running series of lighthearted turn-based strategy games--Worms World Party will undoubtedly be somewhat of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, it's clearly the best Worms game to date, as it offers all the great features found in the previous three iterations as well as the addition of several new gameplay options and modes, including the cooperative multiplayer missions. On the other hand, these new modes are only incremental changes of a formula that's nearly six years old, so players expecting significant changes to the Worms series will likely be disappointed by the latest installment.    The game features the same, great tactical battles as in its predecessors.At its core, Worms World Party is no different from the original Worms, which was released in 1995. The basic premise of the game is simple: You control a team of weapon-toting worms and take turns squaring off against other groups of human- or computer-controlled annelids on any number of side-view outrageous maps. Each team's worm is given a small amount of time to complete a specific set of actions, which typically include moving across the map to set up the optimum attacking location, executing the actual attack, and then retreating into relative safety. Worms are eliminated when you deplete their hit points or when you knock them into the water found in most levels. The weapons that are available to you range from relatively simple arms like shotguns and rocket launchers to truly over-the-top devices like exploding sheep and napalm air strikes. When all your opposing teams' worms have been killed, you're declared the winner. The game is remarkably easy to get into, thanks to its minimal interface and intuitive controls. In fact, these controls are so simple that you can direct your team's actions by using little more than a handful of keystrokes.   Despite its apparent homeliness, Worms World Party is very involved and actually contains a fair amount of depth. For instance, when attacking using a grenade, you'll need to take into account the angle of your enemy relative to your location, the distance to the enemy, the wind direction and wind speed, the fuse timer on the grenade, the 'bounciness' factor of the grenade, and any possible obstructions before attempting to strike. Often you'll also need to mind sporadically placed land mines and fuel drums on each level, as a stray shot into one of these can have dire consequences. Ultimately, you'll find the game's humorous and often-surprising gameplay to be quite addictive, if unchanged from Worms, Worms 2, and Worms Armageddon.   As stated earlier, the new additions to Worms World Party are largely insignificant, as they don't affect the core gameplay at all. The game includes a reference guide called the 'Wormopaedia,' which sorts all of the 60-plus weapons in alphabetical order and gives a technical breakdown of each, including some helpful tips on how best to use each one. The wormpot option is also new, which is basically a random option generator designed to function like a casino-style slot machine. Before starting a game, you're given the option to pull a lever that will spin three reels. Each reel represents a certain gameplay option (such as the inclusion of exploding crates), and all three can combine for nearly 1000 different combinations, resulting in matches that are never quite the same twice. A fairly easy-to-use mission editor also lets you create your own maps, which you can then make available online for other players to download, and a new multiplayer mode will let you play cooperatively with others online. Additionally, Worms World Party comes with several new multiplayer maps, training stages, and puzzle-based single-player maps.    You can play online, or in various single-player and multiplayer modes. Publisher Titus claims that the graphics have also been updated, but you'll be hard pressed to find any notable differences between Worms World Party and Worms Armageddon. Certainly, there's nothing wrong with the graphics--you'll undoubtedly find that Worms World Party's bright colors and fluidly animated backgrounds fit the overall theme of the game quite well. Likewise, the sound effects and music, though largely unchanged from the previous game, complement the admittedly wacky visuals nicely. One serious problem that the retail version of Worms World Party seems to have is its inability to join the Worms.net multiplayer service right out of the box. When first attempting to log on to the service, we were prompted to download a 5.7MB patch before being allowed to move on. Once installed, however, the game's multiplayer component ran smoothly, despite the fact that the only server currently available is located in the UK.   It's a shame that Titus is forcing Worms fans to pay stand-alone prices for what easily could have been an expansion pack. As it is--those who've never played a Worms game or never got around to picking up Worms Armageddon will thoroughly enjoy Worms World Party. But if you're looking forward to a true sequel, you'll have to keep waiting.      ",0

I hate it when bands title the CD after the band name...  (Robert Smith I forgive you - but only cause I love you.)  They don't just write depressing songs by the way.

I don't care... they don't sound the same to me. There seem to be a lot of goodbyes in this CD. Some rude awakenings, mournfull lyrics, and it's been fun.

"917","3654535","indUnk","             Hi everyone.  Wow, I didn't update in a  whole  week almost.   This week has been a  total  non-event. No jobs news or anything at this point, although the Department of Homeland Security has informed me that my visa has been completely processed and I should get my bona-fide plastic green card in the next couple of weeks. Sweet.  I've been ill this week; in fact we all seem to have been a bit under the weather. On Wednesday night I went to bed at about 8pm and slept fitfully for 13 hours, tossing and turning the night through. Not good at all. I feel much better now though, and I'm looking forward to the weekend.  Regarding the title of today's journal - the Buffalo wings refer to what I'll be eating a lot of this weekend. Blondie made 25 pounds (!!) of wings for 4th July so I'll be happily munching away on my favourite food for the next couple of days. There are quite a few of us heading up to the trailer this weekend for fun, food and fireworks. Well, not fireworks, since they're  illegal  in New York state.  Since we're such  good , law abiding citizens, we wouldn't  dream  of, say, popping across the state border and buying fireworks to bring with us. No. We'd  never  do that.  I'll try and get pictures with my camera.  Anyway, the other part of title - the  bomb  part - refers to an apparent bomb scare we had today at the Broad Channel Subway Station. It was interesting in that we saw the Police, Paramedics and the Fire Department heading down there, they stopped all the trains, and apparently also grounded the flights at JFK for a little while. The Channel is right in one of the main flightpaths out of JFK, and when you live by an airport (like we do) it becomes quite obvious when the traffic is grounded, since you can't see or hear any of it. I'm used to 747s flying low every minute or so, and the silence was eerie. While we were outside we head  faint  aircraft, but Blondie said it sounded more like when the F-16s were out on patrol after 9/11 than a regular Commercial airliner. Odd. I haven't seen anything on the news yet, maybe it won't make the news. Its not like anything actually  went off  there.  So that was my excitement for the day. Billy is coming home soon and then we're driving up to the trailer. I'm hoping that traffic won't be too bad but I bet it will  royally  suck, what with it being a holiday weekend and all. Oh, well. Wish us luck.  Until later.  ~Martin         ",0
"918","3653998","indUnk","             Ok, so I have some time to kill so let me tell you about yesterday. So my wonderful wife decides to go to a Madonna concert leaving me alone with the baby for 6 hours. By in itself it wasn't so bad. So she left for the conert and that's when the snafu's started. After getting poop all over my hands and Rennie's cloths I proceeded to church where thankfully god look over me so that nothing happened. Also, my wife was standing next to me for the whole time I was there so I was covered. Well, she left for the concert and I proceeded to the driving range with some friends though jj objected at first, I used my charm to convince her to let me take Rennie with me. Well, it all started OK until some blockhead of a guy started hitting golf balls by tossing it in the air and trying to hit it like a baseball. I reprimanded him and told him to stop in fear that one of those golf balls could carom off the wall and hit Rennie. Well, the fricken oaf didn't even apologize and told his girl who he was trying to impress 'well, at least I didn't punch him out.'  Nice buddy, hitting a guy holding a little baby- takes a lot of class. I must say that I should thank the ladies that were there with us SC and Sun who cared for Rennie while DC and I tried to prove who was the better driving range pro. Well, in my exuberence I forgot the diaper bag and all its trimmings at the range. Thank goodness, my friends had more presence of mind to pick it up for me and bring it home to safety. I felt so stupid after that and inadequete as a daddy. Who knows, maybe I'd have forgotten Rennie if someone didn't remind me.

"919","3650522","RealEstate","       Here I sit in the midst of a flood warning....and what is to be torrential downpour during the late hours and on into tomorrow. Tropical storm Alex is on course to tear up the North Carolina and southern VA shores tomorrow morning/afternoon. Now, I've been in a hurricane out here before (7 years ago?), so I'm not overly excited about what's to come. I mean....it could be worse, right? But what ticks me off is the fact that it has rained every other day (if not every day) since I've been out here. And now with hurricane season on the verge of becoming a reality, it's almost certain that the wet season will continue. Ugh. Hold me.  If you're like me....then you tend to over-react in some situations in which you shouldn't. It's just human nature for some people to act that way. As I was browsing the internet, I was looking through some stories to post...and this one caught my attention. Not because of the brutality or even hilarity of it....but because it proves my point as to how utterly STUPID people can be at times.  urlLink This guy  went too far, my friends. Pay close attention to the man's name. It fits quite nicely. No pun intended, of course.  Here's a random question.....What is it about life that makes you want to question everything you've ever done? Is it just an inherent human emotion to second-guess, or does it exist strictly on a personal level (meaning every person is different)? I find it difficult not to question what's happened in the past. It's not b/c I'm negative about it (although I used to be)....it's just b/c I believe a person's choices are what ultimately shape a life. Choices, rather than god-given talents or abilities, make our lives what they are. Sometimes these choices are given to us, and we don't have much say in them. However in other situations, the choices are indeed made by us....knowingly and whole-heartedly. It is in these decisions that we entrust our futures to. Some decisions may seem good at the time that we make them....but they can often turn out to be the worst decisions of one's life. And it's not always what we decide to do....but rather, what we DON'T decide to do that really hurts in the long run. What we give up. What we choose not to have. And all the same....when we don't realize what we have when we do give it up. Is there an underlying message here? Something to take from this blabber that I find myself writing about? Well....to each his own I guess. But if you're reading this with a clear and thoughtful mind (which I hope most everyone is)....don't say I didn't tell ya so. I just did.

Personality Test.     Wackiness: 38/100 Rationality: 22/100 Constructiveness: 46/100 Leadership: 52/100   You are an SEDF--Sober Emotional Destructive Follower. This makes you an evil genius. You are extremely focused and difficult to distract from your tasks. With luck, you have learned to channel your energies into improving your intellect, rather than destroying the weak and unsuspecting.  Your friends may find you remote and a hard nut to crack. Few of your peers know you very well--even those you have known a long time--because you have expert control of the face you put forth to the world. You prefer to observe, calculate, discern and decide. Your decisions are final, and your desire to be right is impenetrable.  You are not to be messed with. You may explode.    Wackiness: 50/100 Rationality: 34/100 Constructiveness: 46/100 Leadership: 54/100    You are an SEDL--Sober Emotional Destructive Leader. This makes you a dictator. You prefer to control situations, and lack of control makes you physically sick. You feel have responsibility for everyone's welfare, and that you will be blamed when things go wrong. Things do go wrong, and you take it harder than you should.  You rely on the validation and support of others, but you have a secret distrust for people and distaste for their habits and weaknesses that make you keep your distance from them. This makes you very difficult to be with romantically. Still, a level-headed peacemaker can keep you balanced.  Despite your fierce temper and general hot-bloodedness, you have a soft spot for animals and a surprising passion for the arts. Sometimes you would almost rather live by your wits in the wilderness somewhere, if you could bring your books and your sketchbook.  You also have a strange, undeniable sexiness to you. You may go insane.   ~@~  Yes, I took the test twice. Mildly-obsessive-compulsive me does tend to do this to check for consistency. *rolleyes* However, I thought both answers were interesting.

"927","3644623","Government","       Senator McCain has condemned the ad by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, saying 'it reopens all the old wounds of the Vietnam War, which I spent the last 35 years trying to heal...I deplore this kind of politics...I think the ad is dishonest and dishonorable. As it is, none of these individuals served on the boat (Kerry) commanded. Many of his crew have testified to his courage under fire. I think John Kerry served honorably in Vietnam. I think George Bush served honorably in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War.'  The Senator also called on the White House to follow suit and attack the group and the ads.  Admiral Roy Hoffmann, head of the group, said they respected McCain's 'right to express his opinion and we hope he extends to us the same respect and courtesy, particularly since we served with John Kerry, we knew him well and Sen. McCain did not.'  Okay, first, I stand by my statements that, a) Kerry served his country, under fire, in 'Indian Country,' b) however, by making that service the centerpiece of his campaign neither he nor men like McCain should expect a free-ride particularly when c) Kerry has been critical of Bush's service in the National Guard.  In McCain's defense, he calls both the service of Kerry and the President honorable.  But why should the White House condemn the  opinion  of one group of men?  Does Kerry personally condemn every negative statement made about the President?  No; and in fact he contributes to them.  In this case, the group doing this has the background to make these charges and is not a part of the Bush campaign (although Bush and company are obviously going to be pleased with their activities). McCain is, of course, entitled to his opinion; but he should recognize that Kerry is the one who has made service in Vietnam so important in this election, not Bush.        ",0

For me this is my life, where I love being but yern for some excitment, some impromptu reaction. The washing machine drones on, the stove burns, I remain still waiting to be heard or seen, recognizition is so over rated I guess. Daily I scramble to the top, like an unseen race. Maybe here I am creating my own thrill. Pushing to see if I can make it, see if I can win. But tomorrow arrives and the diapers pile up the laundry is never completely done. The beds are a mess again, the booboos need to be kissed, and I run again to some unseen trophy. The crown I wear is stretchmarks, and fat. Oh gosh what am I, I am suppose to be mother and wife, but I am tired so very tired, here the smile will grow and I raise my head above the ashes I create in my mind, and I forge ahead. Some days I look at yesterday, at youth and wonder what if, but there is no glory there, no lonliness, no work, just the rosy glow of yesterdays dreams.

"938","3632278","indUnk","        urlLink    Luego de recoger a mi hija... mientras voy en el auto hacia mi hogar veo al mÃ©ndigo pidiendo dinero, un muchacho jÃ³ven, tan jÃ³ven como aquel que acaba de graduarse de escuela superior, con los pies descalzos, la ropa bastante sucia, me mira y menea el vasito, muevo mi cabeza de lado a lado diciendo que no.  Luego miro hacia al frente y veo un carro que se 'come' la luz roja, y muevo mi cabeza de la misma manera que le hice al mendigo y pienso: 'Esta gente no se quiere!'.  Sigo mi camino y me detengo en la prÃ³xima luz roja, veo para el lado..un niÃ±o saltando en el asiento de al frente del carro.  Cuando voy llegando a mi casa, un grupo de chicos recostados en sus carros y se me quedan mirando como si nunca hubiesen visto a una mujer en su corta vida.  Finalmente llego a mi casa y las ventanas retumban al ritmo del reggetÃ³n del vecino.  Enciendo el televisor y todo lo que se ve es violencia, sexo, infidelidad....  DespuÃ©s de la cena lavo los platos, baÃ±o a mi hija y la acuesto a dormir, termina mi dÃ­a.  Ya amaneciÃ³, de camino al trabajo veo al vendedor de periÃ³dicos, trabajando de pie, bajo el sol, y a veces bajo lluvia pa' ganarse 'dos o tres pesos'.  Nadie quiere darme paso! Carros viajando en direccion contraria para esquivar el tapÃ³n, ni un policÃ­a a la vista.  Finalmente llego al trabajo, saludo: 'Buenos DÃ­as', 'Hola', 'CÃ³mo estas?'. Llego a mi escritorio, en el periÃ³dico: 'Suman 6 accidentes de automÃ³bil cobrando la vida de personas en el dÃ­a de ayer', 'Hombre se suicida luego de matar a su esposa y a su amante', 'NiÃ±o fue encontrado muerto con mÃºltiples hematomas', concierto de artista famoso...'Fraude en compaÃ±Ã­a conocida', 'Incautan $10,0000 dÃ³lares en drogas'.......etc, etc.  En la oficina, aquella persona en el telÃ©fono se sonrÃ­e, estarÃ¡ enamorÃ¡, otra leyendo el periÃ³dico y opinando en voz alta, a quiÃ©n le estarÃ¡ hablando?  Otra persona trabajando como si tuviera que sacar el trabajo de dos dÃ­as en dos horas.  El dÃ­a transcurre, personas hablan en voz baja para que no les escuchen, veo caras tristes y serias, otras caras que parecen estar siempre alegres.  Personas tomando cafÃ© para liberar el 'E-trÃ©s', el otro empleado quejÃ¡ndose porque el papel se quedÃ³ pillado en la copiadora.  Al final del dÃ­a una multitud de empleados en la salida, listos para ponchar, afuera en el 'parking' todo el mundo 'arranca' en el carro como si le fueran a pagar al que llegue primero a su casa.  Y en la calle otra vez el mÃ©ndigo pidiendo dinero, el que se come la luz....  En quÃ© mundo estamos viviendo?  Oyes a aquella persona decirle a su hijo que lo ama y le da un abrazo y cuando se monta en el carro acelera 'sin encomendarse a nadie', y su hijo en el asiento de atrÃ¡s.  Hay quienes le dice a la gente que no fumen porque les hace daÃ±o y cuando llega el fin de semana intoxican su cuerpo con alcohol.  Otros te dicen que organizes tu vida y su casa esta 'patas arriba', cuantas mujeres hablan de que no pueden pagar el telÃ©fono pero 'se hacen' las uÃ±as o van al 'beauty' a pasarse el 'blower' todos los meses.  Otros hablan de que no tienen en 'quÃ© caerse muertos' pero no salen del 'mall'.  Mucha gente te dice que vivas el dia a dia, otros te dicen que tengas presente el futuro.  Un niÃ±o casi no puede caminar por su peso, fatigado avanza a sentarse en una silla, Hm! y despuÃ©s su madre dice que 'es que su hijo es grande y tosco', y luego la oyes hablando sorprendida ante el maltrato de los niÃ±os.  Estamos tan metidos en la rutina diaria que a veces no le damos importancia a lo que pasa a nuestro alrededor, al crimen, al maltrato, la injusticia, tanta maldad.  Por quÃ© insistimos en llevar este estilo de vida?, por quÃ© no mejor tratar de vivir haciendo el 'Bien', nos sentiriamos mucho mejor si nos levantÃ¡ramos todos los dÃ­as y pensaramos: 'Hoy voy a tratar de hacer las cosas bien y de ser un buen ser humano, mejor que ayer'.  Cuantas personas han vivido la vida trabajando para sus ambiciones materiales, y olvidan vivir el presente, cuando realizan cuanto tiempo han perdido ya es demasiado tarde.  Por que no montarnos en el carro y guiar con calma, ser cortÃ©s, sin 'caÃ±onear', si total, a fin de cuentas la prisa nos puede costar la vida.  Llegar al trabajo y dedicarnos a lo nuestro sin importarnos lo que hacen los demÃ¡s, sin envidias, sin rencores, vivir nuestra vida.  Y luego dedicarnos a nuestro hogar, a nuestra familia.  EnseÃ±arles a nuestros hijos valores, a no tener miedo de ser dÃ©bil, de no estar orgulloso de ser 'fuerte', a reÃ­rse si tiene ganas, a llorar si siente el deseo, de no sentirse avergonzado de expresar sus sentimientos, a ganarse las cosas antes de recibirlas, a que luche por las cosas, no se lo des todo.  Por quÃ© no mejor callar cuando las crÃ­ticas negativas quieran salir a flote.  Con cuanta frecuencia nos quejamos de la vida que llevamos?  tan 'ajorÃ¡', porque el telÃ©fono en la oficina no para de sonar, porque a la hora de salir esta lloviendo, porque tienes que ir corriendo a buscar a los hijos, porque mira la hora que es y nos has podido comer.    Con cuanta frecuencia le damos gracias a Dios? Porque tenemos un carro en quÃ© movernos, porque vivimos bajo techo que nos protege del sol y la lluvia, porque podemos comer todos los dÃ­as, aunque no tengamos hambre, porque gozamos de buena salud y podemos trabajar, porque tenemos variedad de diversiones para no aburrirnos.    Con cuanta frecuencia le agradecemos a Dios por la vida misma?  Y todavia me pregunto...  Por quÃ© somos como somos?  By Sandra Falcon    ",0
"939","3630553","Student","                 The last thing Iâ€™d want is to earn enemies; the worst nightmare I could have is having a friend turned into an enemy; and the worst poison I could swallow are the bitter words I would never wish to hear coming from a friend I've known for an ample period of time.  I'd rather have an enemy for a thousand years and win him as a friend in the end, than have a friend for years and lose our friendship over unreasonable matters. Why can't people just look more on the bright side of things rather than wallow in misery because of the dark sides of it. Life is too short to waste over hatred.   I find it so hard to forget, but thatâ€™s not my point. I probably just donâ€™t get it. Is it really that hard to forgive?  And after all that we've been through, I think nothing could ever be more stupid than to throw everything down the drain and forget all the places we've been in just a snap. Life really sucks under best circumstances, but why look at it that way?   i want to be heard. i want to be noticed. i want to be answered.  Apparently, they eyes were blinded for my appeals and the ears were deafened for my voices.  And now, my eyes are fuzzy from tears.        ",0

"941","3630293","Communications-Media","       Five (5) lessons to make you think about the way we treat people.  1 - First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.  During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read the last one: 'What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?'  Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name? I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.  'Absolutely,' said the professor. 'In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say 'hello'.  I've never forgotten that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.   2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain   One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab.  She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A special note was attached... It read: 'Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away. God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others.'  Sincerely, Mrs. Nat King Cole.   3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.  In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him. 'How much is an ice cream sundae?' he asked.  'Fifty cents,' replied the waitress.   The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.   'Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?' he inquired. By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.   'Thirty-five cents,' she brusquely replied.   The little boy again counted his coins. 'I'll have the plain ice cream,' he said.   The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. there, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies... You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.   4 - Fourth Important Lesson. The obstacle in Our Path.  In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.  Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand!  Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.   5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts.  Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare & serious disease. Her only chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness.  The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, 'Yes I'll do it if it will save her.' As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek.   Then his face grew pale and his smile faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, 'Will I start to die right away'.  Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.         ",0

"945","3626646","Student","        So here I was, in the kitchen.  I had just opened the cupboard to get myself a cup.  When all of a sudden, I heard a noise.  I couldn't believe my ears.  'Vroom, vroom,' the noise said.      I ran out of the kitchen and into the living room.  I looked out the window only to find a car that had stopped right beside our mailbox.   I figured that he was either    A) Stealing the mail    B) Giving us a pipe bomb or C) Asking for directions   I settled on A) finally and decided to figure out who it was.  I grabbed my handy dandy binoculars and had a closer look.   It was a red car.  It was sort of beaten up.  But, I knew exactly who it was when I saw the sign on top of his car.  The sign, of course, said MAIL.       It was the MAILMAN!!!  I couldn't believe it!  The mailman was stealing our mail!!   I quickly ran outside (with no shirt on) and ran up to the mailbox.  About half way up, he must have saw me and got scared because he drove away.   When I got there I realized that I had noticed him just in time.  I must have scared him just in time because he didn't have time to steal the mail.  I had scared him away before he even had time to  take anything.  The mail was in the mailbox!      So I grabbed the mail and ran back inside.  I then refreshed myself with a nice glass of water.     I felt a feeling that was so inexplicable that it was great.   The day had been saved (yet again) by JUSTIN KLINE!!!      ",0

"953","3621730","Construction","       Jul 23, 1:32 AM EDT  9/11 Panel Urges Intelligence Overhaul  By TERENCE HUNTAP White House Correspondent   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's leaders failed to grasp the gravity of terrorist threats before the devastating attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, taking actions so feeble they never even slowed the al-Qaida plotters, a national commission said in a blistering report Thursday.   The panel warned 'we are not safe' - and called for major intelligence changes. Its work is sure to reverberate across the presidential campaign.  In an exhaustive investigation of the deadliest attack in U.S. history, the commission noted numerous government missteps but did not cast blame on any official and stopped short of saying the hijackings could have been prevented. While the panel did not fault President Bush or former President Clinton, it did say both failed to make anti-terrorism a top priority.   'We do not believe they fully understood just how many people al-Qaida might kill and how soon it might do it,' the 10-member, bipartisan panel said in its unanimous findings.   'We also believe that they did not take it as seriously as it should be taken. It was not their top priority,' Thomas Kean, the Republican chairman, said at a news conference with members of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. 'We do believe both presidents could have done more in this area.'   The final report, available on the commission Web site and at bookstores, largely mirrored the preliminary reports released during the commission's 20 months of investigation.  Coming less than four months before the election, the politically sensitive report could be trouble for Bush, who has made his handling of terrorism the centerpiece of his campaign and has insisted he fully understood the threat.    Family Members React to 9/11 Report    The report comes on the heels of House and Senate reports that documented U.S. intelligence failures and undermined the major claims cited by Bush to justify the war against Iraq. The commission report repeated its earlier preliminary findings that Saddam Hussein did not have a close relationship with al-Qaida and had nothing to do with the attacks.  Still, in the days after the hijackings, some in the Bush administration were seeking to make that link, the commission found.  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, in a Sept. 17, 2001, memo to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, wrote that if there was 'even a 10 percent chance' that Saddam had a role in the attacks, 'maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat.'  Despite Wolfowitz's arguments, Rumsfeld issued a memo to Pentagon commanders on Sept. 19 that addressed only al-Qaida, the Taliban and Afghanistan.      Bush welcomed the panel's recommendations as 'very constructive,'    although his administration has reacted coolly toward a key proposal to establish a Cabinet-level national intelligence director. He said that 'where government needs to act, we will.'   Bush initially opposed the creation of the commission, resisted the release of some documents and fought against letting national security adviser Condoleezza Rice testify publicly under oath. Still Kean thanked Bush for allowing 'unprecedented access to documents and cooperation from your administration.'  Democrat John Kerry, campaigning for president in Detroit, said disputes within the Bush administration had delayed the commission's work and improvements to the nation's security.   'Nearly three years after terrorists have attacked our shores and murdered our loved ones, this report carries a very simple message for all of America about the security of all Americans - we can do better,' Kerry said.   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., expressed doubt that lawmakers would have time to consider sweeping reforms this year. But efforts began in both the House and Senate to build bipartisan coalitions of support for the recommendations. Relatives of Sept. 11 victims said they would lobby, too.   'The families know that this is an election year. We're going to hold these people's feet to the fire,' said Debra Burlingame, whose brother Charles was the pilot of the hijacked plane that struck the Pentagon.   The report portrayed the Sept. 11 terrorists as sure-footed and determined while the nation they were preparing to strike was unprepared, sluggish and uncomprehending of the imminent danger.   'Across the government, there were failures of imagination, policy, capabilities and management,' the commission concluded in a 567-page indictment that documented a series of missed opportunities by the CIA and FBI to uncover the Sept. 11 plot. Nearly 3,000 people were killed when 19 Arab hijackers flew airliners into New York's Twin Towers, the Pentagon and the Pennsylvania countryside.   Three years later, Americans are safer because of improvements in homeland security and the war against terrorists, the report said.    'But we are not safe.'      'Every expert with whom we spoke told us an attack of even greater magnitude is now possible and even probable,' Kean said. 'We do not have the luxury of time.'  The commission's report said that as the Sept. 11 plot advanced, the U.S. government was bogged down in an outdated Cold War mentality, lacking imagination to deal with new threats or recognize the looming danger.   'What we can say with confidence is that none of the measures adopted by the U.S. government from 1998 to 2001 disturbed or even delayed the progress of the al-Qaida plot,' the report said.   Commission co-chairman Lee Hamilton, a former Democratic congressman from Indiana, said a key finding was that no one in government was in charge of insuring that intelligence agencies pool resources, avoid duplication and plan jointly to keep America safe. To unify efforts, the commission recommended creating a national counterterrorism center.   It also recommended a Cabinet-level national intelligence director to centralize efforts now spread over 15 agencies in six Cabinet departments, including the CIA.  The report said Congress, like the executive branch, responded slowly to the rise of global terrorism.   But the panel found that the 'most important failure' leading to the Sept. 11 attacks 'was one of imagination. We do not believe leaders understood the gravity of the threat.'   The commission identified nine 'specific points of vulnerability' in the Sept. 11 plot that might have led to its disruption had the government been better organized and more watchful. Despite these opportunities, 'we cannot know whether any single step or series of steps would have defeated' the hijackers, the report concluded.   Some members have speculated the attacks could have been stopped. 'We do not know,' Kean said. 'We think it's possible. But we have not drawn that absolute conclusion because we don't believe that absolute conclusion is justified by the facts.'   The report detailed contacts between Iraq and al-Qaida, noting that Osama bin Laden began exploring a possible alliance in the early 1990s. The report said that an Iraqi delegation traveled to Afghanistan in July 1998 to meet with the ruling Taliban and with bin Laden.   While there were 'friendly contacts' between Iraq and al-Qaida and a common hatred of the United States, none of these contacts 'ever developed into a collaborative relationship,' the report said.   That question has been the subject of intense political debate, as critics accuse Bush of exaggerating the contacts between al-Qaida and Iraq to justify the war.  The panel said it did not find evidence that Iran, Iraq's neighbor, had advance knowledge of bin Laden's plans, or that Saudi Arabia's government had a role in the terror conspiracy, which involved    15 Saudi hijackers.            &nbsp;        &nbsp;     So... what does all this mean?

They don't eat up people's gardens, don't nest in corncribs, they don't do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'  â€˜To kill a mocking birdâ€™ is a slow starter. You have a rough time in the beginning wondering what the story is trying to tell you and what the title is all about. After all, you have great expectations from the book right from the start knowing that itâ€™s a Pulitzer Prize winner and a lot of reputation behind it. However, by the time you have reached the end of the book, you are more than satisfied.   It is the story of simple people with simple beliefs â€“ some right, some wrong, some good, some bad, some kind and some harsh. It is a book which challenges the moral beliefs that so many of us take for granted as axioms.  The narrator of the story is Scout, the daughter of Atticus Finch, a criminal defense attorney in the Deep South who is assigned to defend a black man in his trial for raping a white girl. The novel tells the story of how Scout and her family endure the threatening ridicule from their community for Atticus' loyalty to this man.   While Harper Lee delivers the message that black people were discriminated against in the Deep South, the more notable message was the struggle that Atticus Finch has to put up when he chooses to side with the truth. The character of Atticus is not so difficult to identify with. He is a simple man with the courage to stand up for the ideals that he believes in. Such people do exist, in numbers greater than we generally believe.   Perhaps, the greatness of the story lies in its narration through the innocent eyes of young Scout. Unlike most other critically acclaimed novels, â€˜To kill a mocking birdâ€™ is not depressing or hard hitting. It delivers its message in a simple manner, without disrupting the peace of mind of the reader.            ",0

"963","3607859","Science","       When we left off, Elana and I were adjusting to the somewhat rustic conditions in Indira Colony. Little did we know that that was one of the larger, more professional clinics. After spending 2 weeks at Indira Colony with Dr. Sonu, who taught us so much and even let us administer the OPV to the babies, we went to three different villages in the following week. What struck both of us first were the large batches of mosquito eggs in the paddy fields, the standing water on the sides of the streets, the overwhelming number of cows, and the swarms of flies. Living in the villages is like begging to be infected with a communicable disease. The actual clinic was a one-room affair with a porch, which was where the doctor chose to see her patients. We had thought that the lack of privacy at Indira Colony was an issue but at least they had a separation of waiting room and doctor's office. At the village, everyone was just out on the porch together. The immunization program also comes off as less professional; the villages do, in fact, have much worse immunization rates. Instead of having a day once a week for mothers and babies to come in, they have one day a month in each village. It makes sense because of the population difference, but it also means that it's much easier to default on the vaccine regimen. The day we were there happened to be vaccination day, so we went to see how it compared. The vaccines were given in a tiny room in another part of the village. There wasn't an inch of the people there--nurses, mothers, and babies alike--that wasn't covered by flies. To our great surprise and dismay, they didn't disinfect the vaccination site before giving the shot. It must work out since they do it like this all the time without complications, but to us it seemed like an important bit of protocol that they totally disregarded.  Our village experience wasn't bad, just eye-opening. Despite the obviously unsanitary conditions, I enjoyed being there amidst the fields and trees, away from the closeness of the urban slums. One other pleasant (or at least amusing) event was on our final day in the villages, during the midwife training session. After the old women all sang a beautiful Hindi song to us (and forced us to do our painful rendidtion of 'Happy Birthday'), this one woman, stooped and cataract-plagued, got out of her seat and started yelling at us while gesturing to her belly and breasts. We had no clue what she was saying so turned to our doctor for a translation. The woman immediately pushed her roughly away. Instead of a translator, she thought that all we needed was for her to speak more loudly, closer to our faces, and to gesture more violently at her belly. The whole room was laughing at her and at us. Eventually she gave up and our interpreter told us that she was asking us questions about pregnancy and said that it's very important for girls to know how babies are made and how to make love. Basically she tried to give us the sex talk. The last part of her speech was never translated for us, though. The doctor said that the woman wasn't using 'good words' and that she didn't even know what they meant. We suspect her of simply being too embarassed to relay the information.

"967","3605427","indUnk","                    I gave Jim Mahfood's  urlLink  Stupid Comics  #1  an embrassingly favorable review in issue 2.5 (sic) of my former zine,  urlLink  Dysfunxion   (release date: September 2000). I'm not one to recant on what I penned years ago. However, I must say that my interest in his work has somewhat fizzled, bottoming out after  Grrrl Scouts , Vol. 2:  Work Sucks  ended.  I was about to speculate that perhaps I've outgrown it. But that's not quite right: lately, i've been rocking out to the  Fake Songs  album/DVD by  urlLink  Sifl & Ollie   creator  urlLink Liam Lynch , which is as proudly immature as it gets.  It's not that Mahfood has 'gone soft' with age -- his work just kind of stagnated, really. But a certain degree of repetition has never bothered me. For example, when I open a new  urlLink Mark Millar  or  urlLink Warren Ellis  comic, I anticipate a certain degree of crass, shock-value humor: bowel disruptions! superhero penis gags! I've seen it a million times before, and it rarely fails to elicit at least a few guitly chuckles, every time.  So it can't be latent prudery, either. Case in point: I'm still vaguely amused by writer/director  urlLink Kevin Smith , the 'Food's partner-in-crime on the  Clerks  spin-off comics.   But even without considering Mahfood's  urlLink terminally slack  pal, it was very easy to come up with a diverse rogue's gallery of Straight(ish) White(ish) Male celebs whose material is as seemingly offensive as it is hip and (potentially) funny: Adam Sandler, Tom Green, Jack Black, Ali G, the Farrelly Brothers ( There's Something About Mary ), Trey Parker and Matt Stone ( South Park ,  Orgazmo ),  urlLink Lloyd Kaufman  (Troma Films), Mike Judge ( Beavis and Butthead )... heck, even Matt Groening. How come I'm willing to cut those guys more slack than I am prepared to give Mahfood?  ------------------------------------ Ever astute,  urlLink Matthew  offers the following partial explanation:   The aforementioned who's who of infantile parodists have enough self-deprecating wit to suggest that you're laughing  at  their comical intolerance and narrow-mindedness. By subtly owning up to their complicity in the mean-spirited and often petty schadenfreude (be it toilet humor, or meathead impersonations, or poking fun at 'retarded' kids), they makes themselves into the butt of the joke as well, rather than inviting you to laugh along  with  them. In comparison, Mahfood's work falls short of that reflexive auto-mockery.  Moreover, the subjects of Mahfood's  urlLink grafictional output  -- 'fake punks'! stoners, maaaaan! wanna-be ganstas! -- have become so ingrained into mainstream pop consciousness that ridiculing them feels like emptying rounds into a barn-door target. It's futile to label someone a 'poseur' for being enthusastic about something that has no subcultural 'authenticity' to begin with. He's not offering anything different from the surly joker huddled in the corner of the lecture room, making snide remarks about his more outgoing classmates.   It might be amusing when you're a frustrated college kid, but it's just grating when you have more 'adult' responsibilities to deal with.  Perhaps I would be more charitable, had Mahfood's art style improved over the years. But no, the essential formula remains: one third blunt-object fuck-you attitude, one third urban/graf-influenced posturing, one third cartoonish mayhem.  Furthermore, Mahfood's aestheic influence is disgustingly prevalent on open-membership art websites like  urlLink DeviantArt . Amazingly, many of his copycats somehow manage to be even more insenstive and bereft of imagination than he is.  All these reservations didn't stop  urlLink Claire  from buying  urlLink  Bad Ideas  , Mahfood's latest collaboration with Wayne Chinsang and Dave Crosland. However, our curiosity about the project had more to do with its format, completed in week-long period, after last year's San Diego Comic Convention.

Thanks for an amazing weekend and thanks for bringing me out of my comfort zone. Keep in touch. Love to all! ~Melissa              ",0

It was the summer of the 1976 Olympics and I read a science fiction novel about an olympics of the future where the athletes were all genetically enhanced or suspected of such, I can't remember now (much less the name of the book).  And I was too nearsighted and clumsy for the usual sports so I ran cross country in jr. high.  We were fortunate to have a Boston class runner (at the time anyway) for a coach. Made a big difference. Moving to Missouri from North Carolina in high school I ran x-country there also. Skip forward a few years after graduate school and I started again to help quit smoking and just to get some physical activity training up and completing the  urlLink Heart of America Marathon  in 10 weeks in 2001. What the future holds is running a 50 and a 100 miler, which is not as crazy as it sounds.    Track never had an appeal for me, the longer distances are more appropriate to my (somewhat) reserved nature and give me time to think and enjoy life on the road or trail.  It isn't about weight control (though it probably helps) or fitness, but more about being centered within my sense of self.         ",0

I've noticed Rosalind Gardner's book,  urlLink Super Affiliate Handbook  has hit the WAHM world in a big way and quite a few are either currently reading it or planning to buy it soon. I do in fact own the book and think it's an EXCELLENT resource. I tend to do things a little different, so may not be using everything from the book. BUT I found it to be a wonderful step by step book for beginners, and picked up some little ideas (and merchants) that I missed before. Well worth it!   Anyway, the chat was a good one today, and I did enjoy chit chatting with everyone that was there. At one point the chat did turn to SEO as an affiliate marketing chat normally does, so we've decided to have an open discussion on SEO next week. Same day, same time, same place (Wednesday, 2pm EST, at the  urlLink Online Party Room  ). Hope to see an even larger turn out next week. :)  Haven't really given much thought as to what other topics we will have, although I imagin some chats on offline marketing would be great since summer officially begins in a week and a half. The offline world will most deffinately be hoping, so I belive it would be a good idea to have an open chat on some ideas.   I do hope tomorrow we will be able to work on our large business project as I'm anxious to get it done. :)  ~Kara      ",0

And less prostitutionalistic.  The other day I tried to post an entry about gay boys and their cell phones.  I don't know why but it never posted.  I'm not going to rehash too much, but there is some kind of love affair going on there.  Its creepy really, but nevertheless entertaining.

"1011","3571773","Education","             ALA Student Placement  I have been in some thought provoking conversations with Karen Blake - University of Canberra.    Karen has a student placement sponsored by Adult Learning Australia at CARHDS to map the Adult Community Education (ACE) provision in Central Australia.    ACE is a response to the lifelong learning needs of the community and looks as thought our region seriously lacks any provision of these services.   I particularly liked the idea/s of 'Tool Buckets' when comparing the ANTA series of Toolboxes.   The collation information and resources in one 'bucket' rather than a 'box'.  A Bucket can be tipped, poured, inverted (turned over), bits taken out and put back again - it has an open top and is accessible.     A Box is rigid and enclosed and difficult to get into or change its shape.  In relation to ICT being integrated into teaching practices - 'is it the participant who is incompetent or is it the tool for learning that is inappropriate?' Idealists will insist that obvious, simple, problems should be just fixed, rather than wasting time looking for the cause.  Why should there be a division between Indigenous and non-Indigenous learning?               ",0

"1013","3570813","indUnk","                 I start library school at the end of the month, in preparation for that I have orientation this Saturday. And in preparation for that, I had to complete the 'new student technology course' this week. This course consists of 6 short documents you have to read, one evaluation of fill out, one super short assignment basically there to make sure you know how to upload a word document, and free run of the new student message board, which, when you start class for real will be full of class discussion relevant to class, but is now full of pictures of people's cats. I totally thought librarians and cats were just a stereotype, a stereotype based in reality is more like it.  So the assignment was to write a paragraph about yourself in a word document and then send the word document via the electronic 'black board' site. Really, really simple, I'm not sure how to even mess that up. So I sent in my paragraph yesterday, it was about me going to the garlic festival and trying garlic ice cream. And this morning I checked and I recieved 10/10 points. Yea for me. I can attach a file. And the person checking all the files wrote me back a few sentences so I could see where instructor comments go, how that works and stuff. She also said she'd always been curious about garlic ice cream. Nice, cordial response, the black board works fine. Great. Then I notice that the average class grade is 8.73. Not that the grade counts for anything, but really how do you do that assignment wrong? Are there just a few losers who didn't attach the file correctly who got a zero? and that brings everyone's 10 grade down, or are there people who get less than the full 10 points? or are the grades just random to show a reasonable class average? I don't know. But I can only hope that the rest of my assignments are 1/10 this easy.  Meanwhile, this internet thing is great an all, but I'm meeting these people on Saturday and I don't know what to wear. If I wear my cardigan will they think i'm some freakish librarian stereotype? (not like they don't all have their cats at home). Do I dress for school, or do I dress for business? Should I carry a backpack, messenger bag or a large purse?

"1017","3569400","indUnk","          Well, Iâ€™ve hit the one week mark on blogging.&nbsp; I was a blog virgin up to a week ago!&nbsp; So I wanted to take a moment to mark the event.&nbsp; Letâ€™s take our eye off the convention for a moment and reflect.  Without a doubt, Iâ€™m sold.&nbsp; Blogging is awesome!!!&nbsp; And I think being part of a team really puts the cherry on top, to employ a metaphor from my first blog!!!&nbsp; So, yes a little retrospective is in order.  Last week, I was incensed at seeing Sandy Berger having absconded from the National Archives with documents.&nbsp; He and others say honest mistake, no harm no foul.&nbsp; Others say partisan witch hunt.&nbsp; Still others say itâ€™s a serious problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink Well, in my first blog,  I let him have it.  Next, I  urlLink noticed a business story  that I felt was significant.&nbsp; It has little to do with politics, but scrutiny knows no bounds.&nbsp; You can expect more business stories from me.&nbsp; Unlike the usual business press that simply cheers companies who make money and eschews companies who donâ€™t, I want to look beyond the Balance Sheet.&nbsp; Companies are&nbsp;just people afterall.  And another business story followed, this one with a political angle.&nbsp; I  urlLink took the broadcast networks to task  for their abandonment of their solemn obligation to the public.&nbsp; They have made this argument that conventions are news stories and if nothing particularly newsworthy happens, they donâ€™t need to broadcast them.&nbsp; Because they need to broadcast reruns of Law & Order?  Then I noted Lance Armstrongâ€™s  urlLink 6th Tour de France victory .&nbsp; I felt it an appropriate pre-convention human interest story.&nbsp; Thereâ€™s a Franco-American relations angle for anyone willing to take it.  On Sunday night, I was watching convention coverage on television and someone mentioned that Al Jazeera would broadcast from the FleetCenter but that their sign had been taken down.&nbsp; I found a similar story on the internet.&nbsp; It didnâ€™t sound right  urlLink so I posted something .&nbsp; The sign thing is probably a non story, there seems to be a legitimate explanation.&nbsp; But still, as someone pointed out in the comments, it should be noted that the Arab TV network will show more of the convention than Americaâ€™s own broadcast networks.  Finally, I reacted to Ron Reaganâ€™s speech at the convention.&nbsp; I wish I had given it more time and done more research on the topic. But instead,  urlLink I blogged what I knew at the time .&nbsp; I think that is okay as long as we publicize our ignorance but don't distort fact.&nbsp; I believe I made full disclosure on the ignorance part.  Some observations in closing:  1) A picture says a thousand words.&nbsp; Say whatever you want about my writing, but please consider that the pictures posted are an integral part of the overall message.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve chosen the images carefully. 2) I read the comments!&nbsp; Iâ€™ve posted a number of comments to other posts and I consider comments a big part of blogging.&nbsp; I thank everyone for their thoughtful additions, clarifications and opinions.&nbsp; Still, some of you posting as â€œAnonymousâ€ need to step it up a notch. 3) Iâ€™m still learning from the masters, other Hooligans who have posted some phenomenal stuff.&nbsp; Partisan Hack, Screwy Hoolie, Uptown Ruler to name a few.&nbsp; I am humbled in their presence and honored by the invitation to contribute.  Well, thatâ€™s it.&nbsp; You can go back to convention coverage now.&nbsp; Have a great blog! &nbsp;I know I am.          ",0

"1025","3566354","indUnk","                 Let's say for some reason(like perhaps a dramatic population increase in large prehistoric carnivores), that modern society fragments into small tribal groups. I'm wondering what remnants of today's technological wonderland would be retained in the oral and ceremonial traditions of the future tribes.   Picture tomorrow's noble savage, stalking through the overgrown jungles of suburbia. His face, painted with white-out and highlighter marker, is a riot of designs and patterns derived from Nike and McDonalds logos. He wears a necklace made of strung computer semi-conductors, MGD bottle caps, and Lego bricks.   He carries a spear made by mounting a Ginsu knife to an aluminum curtain rod with wound strands of mint-flavored dental floss. His preferred weapon, however, is a PVC pipe blowgun that shoots pushpins coated with Vick's Deep Heating Rub. The pushpins don't really kill anything, but they sure do sting.   Our savage has a long scar along his chin -- a visible reminder of his tribal name, Runs-with-Scissors. The young man is a respected member of the tribe and holds the honorary title of 'Assistant Manager'. His father, a pock-marked tribal elder named Can't-eat-with-a-fork, sits on the tribal council as 'Regional Sales Manager'.   The tribe holds elaborate annual festivals that have origins in the mysterious past. There is 'Carburation Day' in which the participants get rip-roaring drunk and run around in a big left-turn-only circle. Another popular holiday is 'Celebrity Day' where the most vapid member of the tribe is followed around and imitated constantly. The somber ceremony, 'Jump the Shark Day', marks the death of technological civilization with the ritual moaning of  We Built This City (On Rock and Roll)  and the wailing of  Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto .   I'm looking forward to it. In fact, I'm going to go ahead and come up with my own tribal name. Currently I'm torn between 'Gripes-all-the-time' and 'Dangerous-with-stapler.'&nbsp; &nbsp;                ",0

"1030","3561869","indUnk","            So, I just got back from getting my senior pictures taken.&nbsp; That... was a weird experience. I found myself getting uncomfortable... like, the whole time. I felt so stupid, and I looked at how a few of the pictures turned out... I just hope the others are better. Black and white always look better though, so I could just not get any color pictures, haha. I got to wear my rainbow shirt, it makes me smile and it was cool that they actually wanted me to use it. The drive home took waaaay too long, I couldn't believe how long it took. I listened to talk radio most of the time, because I need to 'get with it' as far as current events go for Junior Miss. The topics didn't vary much all day long. There was a lot of talk on Martha Stewart and her prison sentence/house arrest, and some talk on the guy from Tillamook that killed his family and wanted to be&nbsp;his own lawyer or attorney or what not. But what I found the most interesting was all the talk on the presidential election. It seemed as though almost every caller was very liberal and strongly stood behind Kerry, but there were also a lot of Democrats who, despite being democrat, stand behind Bush. Then, the host of the show did this thing that was like, 'Guess who said this' or something, and he'd say something to the effect of 'Iraq having weapons of mass destruction is not acceptable and we have to get rid of Saddam Hussein, and the only way to do that is through war' or something, and everyone would, of course, think that Bush said that, but according to the radio host, Kerry had said it. I don't know where he found the quotes, but if I do find them, I'll let you all know, because I thought it was interesting. A lot of things were said that really made me think, I mean, I don't have any real strong opinions about either presidential candidate because I don't know enough about both of them to really say, but all of the stereotypes that I figured were true were proven false on the show. Quite a few callers completely stood behind Kerry, but when asked to back up what the had to say, they couldn't, they hadn't done their homework to find out where they were getting their information and whether or not it was true, or because the things they said weren't true, according to the host of the show. I don't know how bias the show was, but the host seemed to know what he was talking about, and everything he had to say made real sense, and it made me really think how many people are strongly one direction or the other and they&nbsp;really&nbsp;haven't taken the time to check out both sides before making a decision. At this point, I still don't feel like I have enough information to make a decision, but the guy on the radio really made some interesting points, and he also got me more interested in finding out my own views on the matter.  &nbsp;  Busy busy busy... there have been so many things I've wanted to do lately, but I can't, on account of being so busy! I don't think I would have it any other way, but sometimes I wish I could do what I want to do more often, as opposed to what I need or have to do. It's wonderful, though, when all three of those are the same thing.  &nbsp;  One&nbsp; funny thing (back to talk radio...) - they were discussing obesity in Portland, and the theme song for the segment was Backstreet Boys' 'Larger Than Life'. If&nbsp;only all songs could be that classic.     I visited Aimee at work today, she's working at the Nordstrom anniversary sale - it was crazy! There were SO many people there! And, an hour and a half long wait for the dressing rooms (unless you were like me and just used another department's dressing rooms - only in Brass Plum was it that crowded) but all the clothes were pretty scandalous or not my style at all.

Also, I had to tell my good friend in Yr. 11 last night that I didn't like her anymore than a friend. It was hard to tell her that, I know she is heartbroken. But I had to tell her. I feel so bad about it. To make it worse, my 'best friend' is going off at me & calling me a fagot & shamming me because I told her. Her excuse for it was 'I lead her on...', which I didn't. I tried to develop feelings for her, but I never did. It's not my fault I don't like her in that way...  Enough of that. I just don't understand people. Life is so hard. I don't think I can live with it anymore. Once again, I am having sucidal thoughts. Another thing that makes me even more stressed, is that I listen to everyone elses problems, but I bottle all mine up. I don't anyone about what goes on inside my head. I feel as if I am going to explode. I am ill. Mentally ill...         ",0

"1051","3542946","Student","       I'm not sure where the connection between oil and the war in Iraq is. I know that Iraq has a ton of oil, and that some people think that the reason we invaded Iraq was to exploit this oil, but unless I'm missing something, I think the United States is in fact losing tons of money on the war. We have spent 87 billion so far in Iraq, and it looks like we will continue to spend more. The oil in Iraq is owned by the Iraqi government, which distances itself from the US more and more. The US will have the same access to their oil as previously, and in fact it may be less because of the militants attacks on oilfields. You may say that the reason that the Bush adminstration wanted to attack Iraq was because of their connection to the oil business, and this may be true. However, the reason that 70% of Americans supported the war (not me however) was because they thought we were going to fight a dictator who committed genocide, not because they would profit more from the easier access to oil. Don't even mention Halliburton, they aren't ripping anyone off except we stupid Americans. I am genuinely not sure, but could someone please tell me what the difference between now and our access to Iraq's oil fields, and previously? Thanks.          ",0

Well, my personal definition and opinion is that multiculturalism is racism in a politically-correct guise. It holds that an individualâ€™s identity and personal worth are determined by ethnic/racial membership and that all cultures are of equal worth, regardless of their moral views or how they treat people. Multiculturalism holds that ethnic identity should be a central factor in educational and social policy decisions. Multiculturalism would turn this country into a collection of separatist groups competing with each other for power. So what do you think?    Jon G.          ",0

"1062","3536339","Law","       The Wall Street Journal ran a story yesterday on the Gipper and the subsequent decline of American political cooperation.  I took out of it two things: (1) There was a time in American politics when people fought all day until 6 pm and then went out together as friends.  (2)  That time was recent.    During my first year at law school I noticed how difficult it is to avoid disliking the person you disagree with.  Many people have very strongly held views and when they speak those views emotion and often some 'irrationality' seeps out.  After that happens, it is difficult to resist the animus that can come from emotional involvement.  The feeling of me/us vs. him/them is much easier.    The ability to set that aside and respect a man while disagreeing with him takes concerted effort.  The decline of that respect, today, I believe reflects an endemic loss in our society today.  I recently saw  urlLink  Supersize Me.   Many, if not most, Americans eat copious amounts of cheap, easy (and exceedingly unhealthy) fast food and soda.  Watch CNN or Fox News.  Many, if not most, Americans obtain their information from cheap, easy (and extremely one sided and sensationalistic) news channels.    Many people share views that are polar opposites of our own - often it does not mean that they are immoral or stupid.  But it takes some doing to respect that.         ",0

I'm particularly powerless/unmotivated to do anything about this as I am a temporary employee and I'll be leaving in September. Any attempt to burst forth from said bushel or even set it alight from the inside would not be very productive. Quasi-Mojo usually cheers me up with his miming and his particularly distinctive version of yoga of which the main feature is the release of gas from his rectum. I believe the louder the release the greater the health benefits.  Anyway, I am also kept amused, even though I feel quite mean/weird in the process, by one of my colleagues' use and misuse of the English language. She has a penchant for adapting idioms and many of her adaptions are just delightful. Unfortunately I should have taken closer note, but here's a few that spring to mind that I heard over the last week or two:  'I'm sick to my back eyes with this...' 'I'll be losing money hand over heels here'  To me when some clever retort was made to me:  'Cheeky is as cheeky does eh?' I asked what this meant but she declined to explain it. 'She sends me this form and expects me to make heads or tails of it.' 'God. If they'd brains they'd be intelligent!' 'She was kicking mad' 'She's having a Mickey over there' Refering to a middle-man type situation: 'That's just putting a piggy in the middle of the process.'   I'll write some others if they come back to me. The other fun thing she does is instead of using the past tense with 'should' she uses the present. So it's 'That's not what you shudda doin',' and 'I should have gettin those ages ago,' and  'You should've hearing what he's after saying to me,' and that kind of thing. Magic.  I actually wouldn't have taken much notice of it if Quasi-Mojo hadn't taken to stopping what ever he was doing and clapped his hands while hopping from foot to foot every time he heard something unusual.   For legal reasons the above account should be filed under fiction.   I'll say more about Quasi-Mojo's reappearence in later posts.  For now,  Adieu                ",0

"1092","3519080","indUnk","                 Moments after the 5th inning of the Diamondbacks-Giants game ended on Friday, SP Randy Johnson got in LF Luis Gonzalez' face. Gonzalez had to be held back, as did Johnson, and the two were inches away from a full brawl in the dugout. Johnson then went down the tunnel into the clubhouse and wasn't seen for the rest of the game.  Why?  Luis Gonzalez dropped the third out of the 5th inning. If that's not bad enough, here's another tasty tidbit:  the bases were loaded . A throwing error by CF Steve Finley ensued, and the bases were cleared, with the exception of Edgardo Alfonzo smirking on second base. He hit the line drive to left.  Now hold on a second.  Big Unit, listen to me closely. Everybody makes errors. Even your ugly face isn't perfect. Cy Young winner, Future Hall of Famer, sure. Arrogant loudmouth? That applies too. I'll repeat: everyone makes errors. Babe Ruth struck out in his last at bat. People aren't perfect. As leader of the team, you have every right to chew out anyone you want. But you didn't chew out Finley. He made an error. He isn't perfect. When you didn't chew out Finley, or anyone else, you lost my respect. Are you a good pitcher? Sure. Are you a good leader? Absolutely not. You were cranky that you were getting lit up by Bonds and the gang, and you took it out on Gonzalez. That shows some yellow in that belly of yours. Anyone can pick on the little guy. Congrats, you can, too. Now here's something else for you -- it was YOUR fault those men scored. If YOU hadn't allowed THREE men on base, and just gotten one of the three out, YOU wouldn't be in that situation. Instead, YOU allowed them all on, and your outfielder didn't back you up. His fault? Yes. YOUR fault? You'd better believe it.      ",0

I've been e-mailing back and forth with First today.  Come to find out he's married with a 2 year old little boy.  The funny thing is we were talking about famous people we're attracted to and he said that he and his wife have given eachother 'free passes' to have sex with certain celebrities if given the chance.  However, he said that she added me onto his 'free' list because (and I quote)  ' well she told me that out of all the girls in the world that aren't famous, you are the only one I'm allowed to have sex with cause she is embarrassed cause she thinks you are just laughing at her cause her man is weak.

"1102","3510796","Student","       Ugh, swept out of Wrigley.  The White Sox did what we, as Sox fans, expect from them.  They bent over and grabbed their ankles right when the pressure was on.  There's so much inherent pessimism in being a White Sox fan, knowing your team is, has been, and always will be second-class in this town.  It's something to be embraced rather than fought, really.  It builds character.  Right.  So now, I owe Grey dinner at  urlLink The Parthenon ... assuming that she ever has any free time to make it out to Chicago for dinner.  She has her weekends full till about November, I think, and weekdays, well, that's just a lost cause.  This could very well be one bet I never have to pay out.  Saturday night, I went out to see my friend's boyfriend's band play a bar gig.  They had a great hard rock sound and did a cover of Zeppelin's 'Whole Lotta Love' that sounded incredible, with a drum solo that blew everyone away.  Unfortunately, they were too loud for the venue, it was pouring rain off and on, and the town they were playing in was having their fireworks that night.  So, put that all together, and the end result is a less-than-spectacular turnout.  Staying the whole time though, were two guys in their late 40s wearing NASCAR apparel, rocking out like there was no tomorrow.  (We were out in the eight-one-five, where the downstate twang starts showing up and people think stock car racing is half-sport, half-religion, when in fact it's neither.)  But I told Dan (the aforementioned boyfriend of my friend) that hey, if Cheap Trick can make it big in Japan, there's no reason Desert Plenty can't get their start with the NASCAR crowd.  Sometimes, you find your fans in unexpected places.  Matt's decided that a summer job is just too much to handle.  So that means I've only got 2 weeks left here of having 3 mornings out of the week to myself.  After that, an already-uncomfortable situation will get a little extra boost.  I can't wait to get out of here.  Job listings this week, well, pretty much suck.  But I can't afford to be picky at this point - I'll take just about whatever I can find that will allow me to be self-sufficient.  Speaking of job listings, Grey and I were talking on the phone last night, both dead tired and slap-happy, her from the birthday party, me from a classic 14-hour shift at work.  Now, I'm willing to cut her some slack because we were both sleepy at the time and laughing like a couple of freshly baked stoners, but she insists that if you drop a letter off at the post office on Sunday night (when it's closed,) and the destination is fairly local, that letter will reach its recipient by Monday afternoon, when the mail is delivered.  I say the earliest it gets there is Tuesday, because that letter's not getting touched until Monday morning at the earliest, it's not arriving in a mailbox till Tuesday.  She says she will prove it to me by mailing a letter to herself next Sunday night.  I think that if she was any more full of beans, she'd qualify for farm subsidies.  Especially since I'm working with the metro Chicago postal service, the same people who took 3 letters from me on Thursday, all addressed to the same place, and only one of them showed up on Saturday.  Monday afternoon, my ass.    ",0

Second, it is designed to be reusable, so that writing new card games will be much easier with this library.

"1106","3509206","Student","       So I haven't written in here for a few days now, I couldn't find the time.  We'll start with  Friday: Garbage picking day. It was fun. Well except for the whole picking up garbage part. Nah. It was good. Found a lot of interesting stuff. Tires, clothes, etc. And Trojan did win against Durex. Hahaha. My body hurt so much from picking up all that stuff then walking to and from church. Yup, it just was a fun filled day.   Saturday: Started off by walking to school for the cheerleading competition. We got 2nd place, which is really good. Came home. Got all ready for Lukes party. Went to Lukes party. And well what can I say. Maybe I can put into words everything that I want to say later. I can't seem to find the words right this instant.   Sunday: Came home at 2:30 am. Woke up at 6:50 am. Went to church nice and early. Came home and watched TV until 1pm. I just finished watching an old movie on TV. It's called 'Three came home'. A very, very good movie. I'm fond of old, black and white films. And this was exactly just it. About how the Japanese took over. A ladies story of the whole thing. The rough times they had to go through. Trying to keep herself and her little boy alive. Then at the end Finally being able to see her husband after many years, and thinking this whole time that he was dead. So emotional. I usually can hold it in. But this time I just bawled. Couldn't hold it in. I don't like being so emotional. People assume you are weak, and fragile. While I'd rather be strong and tough.   Well, I'll write more later.   Tootles     -Ela     ",0

"1108","3506037","Arts","       I just wrote this a moment ago and pressed 'Posting' rather than 'Publish Post' and it disappeared. It must have been too close to reality in the Schillerian way, say:  'Der Schein soll nie die Wirklichkeit erreichen, und siegt Natur, so muss die Kunst entweichen.'  This was translated as: The appearance should never reach reality and if nature wins art must disappear.  Which I don't properly understand, so I'm throwing it to question. I read it as - the created object/ thing should never too closely resemble that in nature, and if it does, then there is no room for art.  That art requires a certain level of abstraction to live and prosper.   Anyway, I think I like it. My post though was about The Life and Death of Peter Sellers, which I saw today. It had a line that I really like. Pete's just been rejected for having a rough head, great for radio, by various casting agents. He's upset but reflecting on having wife-kid-radio gig, and should be satisfied with this. He mentions this to his very ambitious mother. Mum says: 'But Peter! I didn't bring you up to be content!'

"1114","3499594","Technology","       Is it nearly 11 p.m. Sunday night yet? Great Scott where did the weekend go?  We jumped into Church this morning, being Sunday. I go to a Menâ€™s Sunday School Class and somehow the hour was spent on the influence of the Muslim religion across the world in addition to our lesson.  Received a major blessing from our Church today, in which I will dedicate a post for it.   After Church, we ran to my wifeâ€™s parentâ€™s house to help move some furniture. When we get there we ate lunch and I ended up helping put in a floor. Has anyone seen these â€˜click and lockâ€™ wooden floors? Basically you have a tongue on one end and a groove on the other. You place them in a 45 degree angle and lock the wood together. There are no seams to it. It went pretty quick after we got past the door hinge ECT. I had to bring the skill saw to do some trimming on the edges.   We also moved the furniture from one house to the other ECT. As we finished up my wifeâ€™s Brother came with a friend and fought with her mom. It boiled down to she been asking him to put up a ceiling fan on the same room we did the floor and he did not want to do it. You have to know the history and I am not getting into it now. So I started on the fan and he and his buddy was finishing it up when Kelli, kids and I split. We ran to the house, I showered while she got the kids ready and we ran back to Church. This next week is Vacation Bible School here and my wife is teaching the Pre-K. We were going to have a baptism but the lady did not make it in. So everyone worked on putting all the rooms together for the week. I was amazed how this Church went all out on Vacation Bible School.   We got home nearly 8 p.m. and bathed the kids, and let them do a sleepover in the living room. They crashed watching â€˜Kim Possible A sitch in timeâ€™ again.  We are trying to catch up on laundry and some minimal cleaning up since we seem to run all weekend.   So itâ€™s now 11:30 p.m. and we are about to hit the bed since we start all over again tomorrow.  Anyone reading this and is a dad, Happy Fathers Day.  Gotta at least tell you, the kids made me some homemade coupons. I received a coupon for a hug, a kiss, and to listen to my songs in the car. heh heh I also received the book 'The Purpose driven Life' by Rick Warren.

"1118","3497278","Sports-Recreation","           Today wasn't much more interesting than the rest of my Memorial weekend days. I went shopping with Cate, Franny, and Betty, which was very fun. We all bought flip-flops at Old Navy, because there was a 2 for $5 sale. I also ended up with a light purple skort, and I am very excited about it. I think I shall wear on the plane to Florida.  But before I went shopping, my mom, sister, and went to Barnes and Noble. I bought One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest for summer reading for Notre Dame. Then I came home and realized I had that we owned that book along with at least five more from the list. So I went back with my mom and exchanged it for the Little Book of Bad Taste, which is very hilarious. It has a bunch a weird facts like: 'A  recipe  once favorted by Idian prices involved the following: take one sparrow and stuff it inside a quail. Stuff the quail into a sand grouse, and the sand grouse inside a chicken. Stuff the chicken inside a peacock, the peacock inside a goat, and the goat inside a whole camel. Place the camel in a hole in the ground, then steam.' The  book also has the top ten people who chocked to death and a bunch of other things.   And now I am watching Superstar USA, which is very funny. All these people think they are really good singers, when really the judges are trying to find the worst singers. Mario is my favorite bad singer, but I think that Jamie will win. Hee.           ",0
"1119","3493704","Engineering","             The infrastructure required depends upon if you are setting up a voice based call center or just a backend operation for your client. For e.g. if you are processing the payroll for your client in the U.S. chances are you really don't need an IPLC line from your facility to your client in the US. However, if you are answering the inbound calls from US then you require an IPLC line.    Few important components of setting up a call center are    1.IPLC (International private leased circuit) line  Dialer  2.CTI (Computer Telephony Integration) - This is the system used for the Screen pop ups as soon as the call is transferred to an agent. The pop up gives the details of the caller, information required & the product details as required by the caller. The info on the pop up screen can vary depending on the settings made. It is optional for a call center.  3.ACD (Automatic call distribution) - the calls are automatically transferred to the agents who are idle. This may be skill based distribution or general transfer of calls. It is the must for a call center.  4.IVR (Interactive Voice Response) - this enables customers calling a contact center to use voice commands to retrieve the information they require without ever speaking to an agent. This basically helps to reduce the man power cost.  5.Voice logger - This logs the conversation of all agents which can be used to check the quality of all agents.  6.MUX - Used to connect the IPLC at both the ends. Now a days most of the call centres are migrating to IP network, hence usage of the MUXs are minimal and routers are needed to connect the IPLC on both ends of the link.  7.Call Centre Management Software - Software to manage the calls & reporting  8.LAN Cabling - This is also referred as backbone.

"1122","3492473","Student","          I'm am so fucking proud of myself right now.   (HUGE SMILE)  Here's my day. I was really pissed because I thought I'd have an amazing night of sleep just because of everything that happened yesterday but it was a damned restless night. I could hardly fall asleep and I kept waking up or just become really hot or uncomfortable. But I went to bed at 3:30am and got up before 11.  That has never happened before.  Well, it probably has but the point of this is I  voluntarily got up at before 11  and I don't think that has happened recently. So I ate, got ready, and just sat online because I didn't feel like doing anything else. Then I went to my Grandpa's.&nbsp;I was going crazy because I couldn't find his newspaper or his watch and he wanted them both! And I looked all over the freaking house! Everywhere! Eventually, we found the newspaper hidden between old newspapers and the watch was stuck in his bed sheets. So that was a relief. After that, Eddie, my mom, and me went to the Richmond mall. Eddie got  *CUTE*  clothes for once! I'm happy with him! And I ended up getting shorts and a tank top. I almost got this really cute black skirt but,  no surprise , my mom thought it was too short. And it wasn't even short!  But my mom didn't see me try&nbsp;what I got&nbsp;on and she always likes to see it so she knows if I look like a hoe or not.&nbsp; So when we got home, she said, 'Uh, those both look a little small.  If you look like a whore with them on, you're not leaving the house! ' So I tried them both on and my mom was like, 'Okay!' See? I'm a good girl.  At times.  (wink!) So then I came home. Cleaned, did crunches, read Chapter 10 of LOTF!  Only two more fucking chapters and I'm done with that bitch!  But then I have Tom Sawyer...uh! So I ate and got ready for soccer. Uh, soccer. Enough said!  Well, let's just say, I'm damn proud of myself because of soccer!  We did our warm up mile, no surprise, Nicole and I were in the back! But it was so amazing, Nicole just kept saying she refused to walk and  she kept giving me the strength to keep running and not walk.  So we finished and Coach Gamire mumbled, 'Under 7, good job!' to the whole team. And I'm like WTF?! 'What was Nicole and my time?' 'Under 7 minutes.' First off, I've  never  ran a whole mile without walking. So that in itself is an accomplishment. And then, I've  never  ran a mile in 6 minutes and how ever many seconds!  And now I did!   I was soo happy about that!  But later we did some crazy ass sprints and I had the worst asthma attack  I've ever had.  I was just wheezing so much and my breathing was so heavy and my chest was soo tight. I thought I was gonna pass out. But I kept going and I finished. And for the cool down mile, I didn't walk any. Wow! And even if Nicole and I came in last, we gave it our best, we didn't walk, and we finished. I say that's good enough. And if someone disagrees,  FUCK YOU!  I'm getting good. And it's only the second&nbsp;day of practice.  I better be hot by the end of this season  with all the hard work I'm putting in. But I'm gonna hurt like a mother fucker tomorrow. Today I was hardly sore. But we did double the amount of lundges and even more running and I'm already hurting so I can't wait til tomorrow! I came home and just like fell on my bed.  It's never&nbsp;felt that good before. &nbsp;And then I watched America's Next Top Model. I was totally surprised the one girl won. I wanted her to win but the other girl she was against was like Miss All American. But I'm glad she didn't. And now I'm here.              ",0

"1126","3490286","Law","        I have this horrible habit of not doing things that I'm supposed to do when I'm supposed to do it. A prime example would be right now, at the&nbsp;time of writing this entry.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I'm supposed to fill up some forms to be presented at tomorrow's (or later today, whichever way you want to look at it) tutorial. It's less than half done, but here I am writing another entry for no reason other than escaping the inevitable fact that I shall have to complete my work by tonight or tomorrow's (or later today, again, whichever way you want to look at it) tutorial session will be a rather excrutiating affair.  &nbsp; But I'm not worried, aren't I? It's nothing I can't handle, right? &nbsp; Probably...maybe. &nbsp; Earlier tonight I took a lonely drive to nowhere in particular. It would've been better if it had rained, though. The skyscapes of Kuala Lumpur looks better in neon and rain. But, as it was, it hadn't been raining, and I drove aimlessly with Jon Bon Jovi's  Destination Anywhere  (an album best listened on lonely rainy nights) keeping me company on the radio. The cityscape illuminated the night majestically, nonetheless. &nbsp; And now I'm in front of the PC, Forms 13A, 48A, 48F and 6 of the Companies Act on seperate Words windows and this blog's 'Create A New Post' page on another window, shows the reader where my priorities lay. &nbsp; It's just the  malas&nbsp; (lazy)&nbsp;factor, this. I'll get around to filling up the forms eventually. It's a walk in the park compared to what comes later in the semester. No rush, take my time. &nbsp; And that time is now. I've bided my time long enough. It's time to get back to work. Have a nice day. And wish me luck. &nbsp; Thank you. &nbsp;          ",0
"1127","3490198","indUnk","       I wasnÂ´t in the mood to blog lately but now that I am at work I might as well waste some time giving you the update on whatÂ´s been happening in my oh-so-interesting-life lately. Remember the 250,- bucks I had to pay for my credentials translations? That bitch had the nerve to make a mistake in it! I mean, cÂ´mon I paid fucking 250,- EUR for that shyt and you make a mistake? Anyway, I called them up last Thursday and they said they would send me the corrected stuff again. HavenÂ´t received anything so far though! I give them untill Thursday! And while we at it (the college thing I mean), I found out that I will have to do the CUNY Assessment test before IÂ´ll be accepted. WHOOOHOOOO!! Checking that shyt out gave me the creeps. The Reading and Writing exams should work out all right for me ( Yes, I am conceited enough to say that my English skills are pretty good for a non-native speaker)  but the mathmatics part got me the shock of my life. DARN IT! I hate mathmatics, always have and always will...It was the luckiest day of my life when I had finished highschool and thought 'ThatÂ´s it! No more maths for me!' Boy, was I wrong. I looked at those example tests and I donÂ´t rememeber shit. Nothing, Niente, Nix....So I guess I`ll just have to sit my azz down and learn that stuff again.  (Not good for my momentarily bad mood at all)  Dorene said she would ask her sister for advice  (sheÂ´s got something to do with some kinda college in NYC)  and I hope sheÂ´ll be able to help me a little. Met my girl Julia on saturday and we  ( okay, I..)  went shopping. I had to get some stuff for our annual Sales Meeting this coming weekend. Well, I was lucky and got me a white suit with a red blouse and some red shoes .(No, IÂ´m NOT the 'little black dress' kinda girl)  ItÂ´ll do just fine. We had some nachos and later some ice- cream  (okay, again:  I  had the nachos and the ice-cream! Thx girl for giving me a bad conscience again..lol)  and did the shopping in between. But the best part of the day was the 'LEGALIZE IT' demonstration that took place that day. Okay, IÂ´m all for it...itÂ´s not worse than booze BUT damm it, canÂ´t you do it with some style??  (DonÂ´t get me wrong, you are a punk? itÂ´s all cool with me! you are a rasta? ThatÂ´s even kooler with me! So thatÂ´s NOT what I mean!)  Please be at least able to hold a decent speech! You expect people to listen and even be convinced by what you have to say when you canÂ´t even get a straight sentence out? YOU ARE PLAYING STRAIGHT INTO THEIR HANDS! Like I told Julia :' DonÂ´t fucking get stoned before holding that damm speech!'  (rolls eyes)  Anyway, we had fun, esp. watching some 15-year-old-Harry-Potter-look-a-likes feeling pretty damm kool with their green spray hair color and palestinian cloth. Impressive!   Oh yeah, Germany DIDNÂ´T make it to the next round and I was devastated for a day or two but itÂ´s all good now and IÂ´m all for Portugal now.  (Did I mention that I have a thing for FigoÂ´s hairy arms? Turns me on tremendously)   They kicked England out and that was fun to watch.

There were so many reasons:  - My neighbor's pounding stereo     lovin' you is what I got   remember that    lovin' you is what I got   remember that    lovin' you is what I got   remember that   - My fist on the wall   BAM BAM BAM  BAM BAM BAM    - The car alarm that went off sometime after 1 am. I have never heard a car alarm go off in our peaceful cherry blossom neighborhood. I donâ€™t know whose car it was, but judging by the intensity of the alarm, they must keep it parked on my nightstand.  - My husband's normally slender body that increases in size at night to take up 9/10ths of the mattress, and then radiates more heat than the sun.  - Dante: the cat who likes to lick any exposed skin and who takes up the remaining 1/10th of the mattress.  Yet, the greatest contributor to my insomnia was  ANGST . I checked my blog. I use this word in every other post. Angst is outdated and  oh so  1990, yet my spirit is riddled with this ridiculous PoMo emotion.  The War. For all logical reasons - I should just accept what I cannot change, I can't believe that my actions have no impact on the world. I should just see my privilege as some sad fact of humanity and just be thankful I landed in the  haves  camp and not the  have nots  camp. My mind and heart would be so much more peaceful if only my filter was narrowed to let in only what facts I need to live out my day-to-day life and plan my sparkling future. Sure, it's okay to feel bad about the war and the violence in the world - just don't let it keep you up at night.  I fail at measured apathy. Crap.

This isnt anthing new, you can see it practically everyday on shows like Springer, the Ricki Lake show, Maury Povich and the like. But it still boils my blood. HOW are the parents not charged with child endangerment? I don't give a fork what the doctors say, that kid is morbidly obesse. The weight isn't going to suddenly dissappear as he gets older. He's gonna die.  Now, I'm a fat guy, but at least as an adult I am responsible for what I put on my plate, and consequently what goes in my mouth. This kid, and his obesse brother, don't have this luxury. It all comes down to what the parents feed them. You cannot convince me that's just baby fat or he's just 'big for his age'. His parents over feed him, and feed him totally the wrong foods. Case closed.   The kids should be taken away from them, until such time they can prove themselves to be fit parents. Just one more reason people should need to pass a course, and a psych exam before they are allowed to be responsible for children.         ",0
"1142","3476348","Advertising","       Second in my series of posts containing strange yet compelling poetry found in spam emails. This one curiously came from myself, and was about a penis enlarger. You would think if I was selling that stuff, I would have used it already.  Anyway, please start your beat-nik drums for this gem:  'She read me over and over. One day she had a picnic on a hill. My hill. I saw my own stump. He came with his father and some friends. They worked hard, and built a tree house in me! I thought of all the joy I had given this family. The happy little boy and his kite. The father and his newspaper.  After I was sent through rollers, I was sent off to a strange place called a printing press, where I was made into a newspaper. The big sister and her book. For once in a long time, I was happy. Suddenly I felt strange and...different. As they sent me through rollers I fell asleep, expecting never to awaken. I didn't bother to read myself. I was too tired. When I woke up, the little boy's father was reading me!'         ",0
"1143","3474005","Consulting","       I have wanted to start a blog for some time now.  If for no other reason than to simply express my thoughts and feelings on life and it's events both personal and otherwise.  I read a great deal on-line about world events, sports, etc.  I would assume that this will evolve as time goes by into what I need it to be...a place to vent, to debate, to laugh.  I am a grounded conservative, meaning I don't recite the party talking points on issues and tend to approach matters of politics wigth an open mind.  Having an open mind has allowed me to learn a great deal from some very interesting people with varied ideologies.  I haven't always been this way...growing up with fairly liberal parents and attending a very liberal college in the late 80's/early 90's made be think that I was a Democrat, and I voted for Bill Clinton in '92 after graduation.  As I have become older, and more mature...experiencing much more of life than I had up until '92...I have found that my true beliefs are more on the conservative side.  For example, I support the War in Iraq...a flash-point of some of the most heated political debates and opinions that I have ever seen in my lifetime.  I will vote for Dubya this November, although I, like other conservatives, am concerned about what we are faced with over there.  I have been pushed a bit more to the 'right' by the behavior of the liberals and 'hate-Bush' crowd that have, I believe, harmed this country in this time of war.  The momentum seems to be with these people, although I still feel Bush will beat Kerry in November.    On a lighter note...I am a big sports fan.  I played college football a long time ago and have been a season ticket holder for the San Antonio Spurs (World Champs '99, '03) since 1997.  Prior to that, my father held season tickets (and was actually one of 40 original investors in the team when the moved to San Antonio in 1973) since the beginning of the franchise when I was but a wee little man.  I also have season tickets to University of Texas football games and have been a diehard fan almost all of my life.  I am always up for sports discussions.  As for a little of my personal life...I am a mortgage broker and have enjoyed a very fruitful year and a half. Prior to that I was an executive with the world's largest producer of live entertainment.  I worked in the concerts division and spent several years opening and running a new venue in Texas.  I am blessed with wonderful friendships, a great family (mother and father deceased) and a relationship of almost 2 years which is teetering on the brink of disaster.  It will be fun to wrap about this also.  Bottom line is this is starting as an experiment, and I hope that it will evolve into something that I can be proud of.         ",0

"1148","3471937","BusinessServices","                 I had a dream about falling last night.  It wasn't your typical falling dream though.  I was riding this dirt bike around this canyon.  The canyon was not the size of the grand canyon. It actually resembled this gulley or valley that is at Brookside Park because it was covered with grass.  But it was much deeper than the one at Brookside Park and the canyon walls were nearly vertical.  So, I was riding this dirt bike.  The edge around the canyon was somewhat curvy and I was riding close to the edge. I was fine for a while but when I got to the other side of the canyon, there was a slight decline and I started picking up speed and barreling right toward the edge of the canyon.  So the next thing you know, I'm riding this dirt bike nearly vertical down this canyon. I was actually having a blast.  But then suddenly my bike was gone and the canyon wall was completely vertical and I was just falling straight down. It was a very long fall, so I was having time to try to figure out keeping myself from dying. I decide that if I position my feet in this specific way then I'll probably be okay.  I catch this glimpse of some weeds growing out of the canyon wall. I grab hold of the weeds just in case, and somehow they end up being the most stable weeds ever.  The weeds slow my fall enough and a few seconds later I hit the ground (with my feet in that specific 'lifesaving' position), and I was just fine.  My mom suddenly appears at the top of the canyon and yells down to see if I'm okay.  My heart was beating like crazy but I almost wanted to do it again.  So do you think that is an indication that I need more adventure in my life right now?               ",0

Because of his wisdom, God was able to create the world knowing perfectly well how it would have to work.  He made the entire earth, the oceans, streams, and rivers, and the sky, clouds, and rain.  It was his wisdom that allowed him to know exactly how to make the world.  We should use our wisdom too, to make sound decisions, using our best judgment at all times.  We should always keep those things in the front of our minds so we can make our decisions based on what God would want us to do.  Then we can be safe and secure that we are going down the right path, without fear or stress or concerns.  We'll be able to sleep well at night knowing everything is in order.  Another way to look at the 'God takes care of the details' thing.

I don't need to be afraid or have fears of the future, where I'm going to end up career-wise, whether I'm making the right decisions on a job, all of that.  It will work out.

Now bear in mind, we have already have a no public smoking law here in NYC to the point where you can't even smoke in a Bar or Nightclub anymore. They have the cigarettes taxed up the ass to where you have to pay almost 7.00 a fucking pack! Now to add insult to injury, they have deemed it necessary to make the cigarettes 'Self-extinguishing'. Im paying friggin 6.50 to have my motherfucking cigarettes go out on me every few goddamn seconds and have the cigarette taste like shit and smell like shit. Not only does the cigarette go out, AND taste like shit...the fucking thing burns from the inside UP! So now I got a damn cigarette thats burning from the inside UP with a big huge hot ash falling on my hand. This is just total Bullshit. Our mayor is looking out for the Insurance companies and the lighter corporations with this shit. Never mind the little guy who choses to smoke , the bar owner or club owner who has lost revenue from smokers, the local grocer who has lost revenue from smokers going to outside sources for cigarettes, the farmers supplying the tobacco, or the american workers working in the factories that produce the cigarettes. This is just bullshit!  Recently pet owners got a nice blow handed to them. No more Barking will be allowed. Well I guess you guys are gonna have a taste of having your preferences stripped from you. I don't feel bad...since the majority of the people that started all this shit were probably PETA card carrying nature freaks anyways. Pretty soon it will be even more restrictions and taxes for you guys next.

There was this huge guy that was so drunk, he was  urlLink 'River Dancing'  and I think we even caught him moon dancing!  After a couple of drinks, everybody got the urge to dance.  Being the single guy, they send me out first.  So I start looking around the dance floor and saw the one person in the entire bar that wasn't dressed country style.  She was in green shorts, a red top and converse low tops.  I noticed she had been on the dance floor a lot during the night, sometimes dancing be herself or with old men.  I figured she was a dance instructor, my friends didn't.  So when they pointed her out to go dance with, I grinned, smiled and nodded my head.   It was the beginning of the song. I walked up to her and asked her if she would show me the dance.  She nodded and smiled.  (At this point, I knew I didn't know the steps to the song, but I was with a cute little dance instructor right?)  It turns out to be the complicated 12 step dance with a lot of spinning. I did my best to stay focused while trying to figure the steps out.  Some how, I managed.  So, there we are dancing around the dance floor, I noticed she was pretty cute.  She had that librarian thing... You know, glasses, hair pulled back in a bun.  So the song came to an end and the next one that came on was a really slow song.  So we agreed on one more dance. She put her arms around my neck and we danced closer.  I noticed she smelled really great.  We finished the song, I thanked her for the dance, and then I walked triumphantly back to the table to join my group.  As I sat down, I noticed I could still smell her.  I looked down at my shirt and my hands.  I realized I was covered with glitter. I recall she was quite sparkly; I think she had on that sparkly lotion.  Well, it only took a few minutes for the boys to realize I was proliferated with glitter.  I spent the rest of the night meeting other girls.

"1164","3456542","Non-Profit","           Denzel Washington : A Man With A Dream   My mind is still reeling from watching  The Manchurian Candidate  this evening, but I'm not quite sure which way it's reeling yet. The film is a remake of the classic 1962 film that has set the bar for all other political movie commentary. The original film, starring Frank Sinatra and Angela Landsbury, commented on the Cold War and the communist threat. To make the film more relevant to today's audience, director Jonathan Demme ( Silence of the Lambs     Liev Schreiber : Mama's Boy?   Unfortunately, I felt like the film spent too much time in either the bleakness of the world being painted -- long, pained looks from Marco or Shaw, inordinately long scenes of phones ringing as the characters do nothing, time spent panning through lonely apartments -- or artfully trying to show us surreal images of the soldier's dreams. For example, what did the Arab women have to do with the dream? It just seemed like so much was going on that it took away from the statement on the American political scene.  But, just as I commend the movie for its reflections on current day politics, it's not enough. I felt like, while the themes were there, this was a presidential campaign that just couldn't happen. For example, the last minute Vice President swap at the convention? We live in a world where we think the presidential candidate is NUTS if they haven't announced a running mate going into the conventions. Then, I thought it weird that these two diametrically opposed politicians (Voigt's liberal Jordan and Streep's ultra-conservative Prentiss Shaw) were from the same party. We live in a world of extremely polarized politics. While there are moderate politicans in the party, you never see people of two extremes. Finally, the politicans themselves did not seem like people Americans would actually elect. In this election season, where Americans were clamoring to know more about John Kerry and are criticizing the opinions of Teresa Heinz Kerry, why would people be thrilled about a plastic presidential candidate, a cardboard vice presidential candidate and a dragon lady like Senator?      Meryl Streep:  Cartoon Extravaganza   A note on Meryl Streep's performance which some have called brilliant and other's have called strangely distracting. I liked Meryl Streep's performance. What's funny is that many newspapers have drawn comparissons to her and Hillary Clinton. While, yes, the two are the junior Senators from New York, Streep has said that she drew more inspiration from the likes of Karen Hughes, the heinous campaign adviser for Bush/Cheney 2004. I believe the latter. Meryl did not go for the intense creepiness of Landsbury, but, instead, gave us an almost cartoony and completely  over-the-top performance. She's more  Death Becomes Her  than  Sophie's Choice  in this film.  And, that's okay.  And, finally, the best thing to me was the cameo by Mr. Al Franken as, of all things, an objective journalist.  We love you, Al!  So, I give  Manchurian Candidate    ONE THUMB UP, ONE THUMB DOWN, TWO AND A HALF STARS AND ONE RIPE AND ONE GREEN TOMATO  .

We also went to the resturant that was in the Jeopardy question about a couple weeks ago...the name escapes me right now. We, of course, couldn't leave without going to the Westby creamery and buying some cheese curds, RIGHT before they closed to our good fortune and your dismay, hahahahahaha.

"1174","3451143","indUnk","       When life gets depressing I've always found comfort in movies.  People have never been able to console me that well.  Who knows why.  Maybe because through their back pats and hugs I am reminded of whatever I would rather forget.  So, I often turn to the familiar faces in my favorite movies.    For problems with love usually the Jon Favreau movie 'Love and Sex' or 'Broadcast News' (which I also turn to for job woes).  For all other problems including those involving friendship, disappointment and general down in the dumps I mostly put on Stanley Tucci's films (pretty much just 'The Impostors' and 'Big Night'), 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'Guys and Dolls' and 'The Good Girl.'   And if I'm seriously wallowing in self-pity I watch 'Donnie Darko'-- which, believe it or not always makes me feel better (I remember that at least I'm not seeing at psychotic bunny).     Lately, my film companions haven't been helping with frustration.  I sit down to watch one and find I would rather be plucking my eyebrows (maybe not that, but you get the point, I'm bored from the beginning).  To ease my worries I have been obsessively (or more obsessively than usual) watching my old taped episodes of 'Homicide'.     My friends reading this are now rolling their eyes.  I'm quite sure that they thought that I was already watching the show every spare moment in my life.  But they're wrong. Before the past two weeks, I've been on a H:LOTS hiatus for probably about two or three months.  I'd watch the occasional episode every now and then (more than likely 'A Model Citizen' from Season Two or 'Night of the Dead Living' from Season One), but I haven't broke out the tapes since they started coming out with the box sets-- so, it's been almost a year.   Now I find myself compulsively watching the things.  Even now, James Earl Jones is talking to Yaphet Koto and fixing a basketball net in the background (I could tell you about the rest of the episode almost verbatim, but I wouldn't want to spoil anything?).    Who knew that murders, suicides, morgues, interrogations, bad ties and Richard Belzer could make a person so happy?    And even though I have absolutely no money for it, I still shelled about $66.48 for the Season Four Box Set.  Mike Kellerman will arrive tomorrow-- just in time to help me cope with another job rejection.    But enough about me, what do you watch when you've had a shitty day (or month)?         ",0

"1176","3448192","Publishing","                 I have recovered from most of my bossâ€™ crude words and my own crude snot depositing habits by now. I think he felt bad about it. Not about my flu, but for spitting the dummy at me last Friday. He invited me plus the rest who were in the orifice for beers yesterday. He also told me how his sonâ€™s new girlfriend didnâ€™t believe I was â€œan 8-foot tall woman with huge titsâ€ until she met me, which was also yesterday. As exaggerated his berate could be, so could his flattery â€“ if you can call his description of me to her â€˜flatteryâ€™ to begin withâ€¦    I am so excited about tomorrow and this whole week! So excited I cannot organise myself for Ferragamo at the Divine Wine Extraordinaire tonight. Fuck it. Itâ€™s formal wear anyway and I ainâ€™t got those type of rags. I thought I could pull something off with my suede pants and a jacket but I donâ€™t know why I dressed myself in a skirt and I am wearing sneakers instead.   Work wise, itâ€™s still busy around here. We hope nothing goes wrong and that we can put the magazine to bed today. I have already started on our September issue. Itâ€™s gonna be another monster with our annual Spa feature plus a special 20-page British update.   I thought I couldnâ€™t take the Thursday â€“ my birthday â€“ off, but itâ€™s looking now as if I could. Which will be immense help because we are so gonna large it Wednesday night at Thumper â€“ itâ€™s free pist, my man, we just found out yesterday. First we got our mitts on invites now we are gonna party like itâ€™s 22 July 1978 on the house!   We are flying to Bangers the next day. If I can get that day off, there are so many important things I could do. Firstly I could stay in bed till 12. I could pack our stuff (which will take me like what? 15 minutes with good music on). I could remove my body hair. I could repeat â€˜Jelte is a sweet guy, he loves me so much, and I love him so much too, so I should stop being so mean to him just because I am a stressed catâ€™ in front of the mirror for one hour. After that I can sleep again.   Anyway we met with Shazamâ€™s â€˜amiâ€™ last night. She cooked us full-on Sri Lankan dinner at his place. We pigged out on fried potato cubes with anchovies, chillies and onions. We dunk gobs of dhal or lentil curry on our food. We had second helpings of the tomato-curry chicken. Her basmati rice was divine! Light as air! It was like eating curried clouds. I had two rounds of everything and I mentally struck off my bikini from my list of things to pack for Bangkok. When Jelte massaged my feet on the couch, I surrendered. You guessed it â€“ I hibernated with a 45-minutes sleep.   Jelts gonna be working a little late today so Iâ€™d better get some currency changed and if I can find one, a new top. I can also sit in a cafÃ© and finish reading Mammoth Hunters â€“ the third in the Earth Children series.   Aahâ€¦ I have missed out on writing so much about the last couple of days. Some not so nice, some very nice. Very nice like going back home on Sunday and ate porridge that my sis Bobo cooked. We (me) bitched and moaned a little. We watched porn together (and I was horrified and I got nightmares about one particularly sick sick sick one!). I got my guitar back â€“ itâ€™s in serious need of tuning. Also about the day when boss screamed at me, the posse came down to meet Jelte and I at Dempsey Hut to cheer me up, whether they realised that I was miserable in the first place or not, I was very cheered up then what with Chaplin after that :o).   Well, this has taken me the course of one day to write. Itâ€™s getting too long so Iâ€™d better stop now.          ",0

But in the simple fact that it all went smoothly, that the people were fantastic, and that everything matched my expectations. It helped that I was tempering my expectations, but I knew that if I didnâ€™t, the trip, the country, my vision of Israel and Judaism in general could have been knocked down or elevated beyond the rational.

"1183","3438901","indUnk","       Hello....My name is Kat.........AKA Kathy and nicknamed Katfish by my sister in law and brother in law. Born in the Elkhart, Indiana, 12-18-1964. I was raised in a small town, Bristol, Indiana. My husband and I recently moved to Bristol about 4 months ago, after living in Elkhart for the last 5 years. We have two 'kids' named Jack and Mabel. Jack is our 3 year old green iguana and Mabel is our 5 year old chuckwalla (southwestern desert lizard). Both of our 'kids' are very spoiled! They have their own custom rooms which I built when we purchased our home last fall.  The home we purchased was in quite a state of need. It was reposessed by the bank because the previous owner could no longer afford it and quite obviously, couldn't take care of it. It took us three months of labor to get the house in 'move-in' shape. We replaced floors, doors, light fixtures, faucets, outlets and switches....in other words, we did a major overhaul. We are still not done with the home yet. It will need a new roof, likely next year. We have numerous little things we want to do as well. The big project lately has been reclaiming the existing landscape and cleaning up the stagnant frog pond otherwise known as an inground swimming pool. The pool guys will be coming to replace the liner in a week or so, that is if it ever stops raining here!!! However, in the meantime, I have amazingly cleaned it up enough to swim in. I never knew brackish,leaf filled, smelly water could become so clean! It has taken a major effort on my part. I work part time so I have more available time to get this house and yard back in nice shape. So far so good but sooooooo much work! It has been rewarding though. Yesterday, I finally got the rest of the front flower bed cleaned out, fresh mulch down and lots of pretty flowers planted(white zinnias,peach, purple and white verbena, blue salvia, coleus and white alyssum). I also set work...dread...on the back yard's overgrown and weedy landscapes. This yard was/is such a mess! It had been let go for at least 2 years or better. I weeded a third of the large bed on the upper terrace of the yard. I planted my tomatoes there. The rest will be annuals and perennials. I am not planting my usual big veggie garden this year. I will hopefully do that next year.          ",0

This morning, as I was humming the tune of a song before I even knew what I was doing, I thought: 'Kristine - top five most defining pieces of media that have come through your life'.  But before we hit that topic.  Let us do a different top 5 list.  Top five silences:  5) The silence inside a car right after you shut the door on a summer night - the cicadas and crickets strumming in the dew outside.  4) The silence due to the lag time on a very long distance telephone call: 'hello?'  ...... 'hello!'  3) On one of your favorite CDs, the silence before the best track starts.  When the previous track has ended and your body has premonitions of the chords about to strike.    2) That electric silence before a first kiss.  I wish, I wish, I wish..... spark.* splash - Oh no! hmmmmmmmmm  1) This one:    'Tell me something nice'    *silence*    'Is there so little about me you like?'    'No. So much'  Anyone care to play?  Come up with your own top 5 list?  I've got several others in store.         ",0
"1185","3436752","indUnk","       Dear Rohit,            Of course I remember you. You mailed around this time last year. I myself stopped by HPS in December and caught up with Mrs. Rajni Gauri Shankar. Anyway, I understand Krishnamurthy is hardly an option these days. Chari was the one who made it worth it. But I wonder how his supporting staff is. To be honest, it's hardly a concern to me now. I think the whole approach to JEE needs a huge revamp.              First things first. Being in Ramaiah, you're surrounded by a hundred idiots. Remember that. Don't let any stupid theories about entrance test marks and seating position interfere with your confidence. You'll make it to IIT if you work hard now and don't let those idiots break you. That's all there is to it. I don't remember what marks I got and how good or bad that total was. I was in the third row and still at the bottom of the class in my first year. So there!              You take care of yourself. Get all these extra ideas out of your head. Leave the others to waste their time theorising about the impact of the colour of your shirt and thickness of your chappals' soles on your rank in the JEE. Just work hard. All will be well. Will be all for now.  Ever yours, Rahul.  p.s: am very much in Hyderabad now. Somehow haven't been able to gather the energy to blog of late. Much has happened. I left IIT. Am on my last trip to Hyderabad. etc. Am on my way to the Washington University in St. Louis for an MS in Computer Science. Let's see when I can blog next. It's heartening that someone actually misses my blog. I was worried about its deterioration!  ===== Maybe the tears that I cry for you drench the greater part of me, Maybe I don't really miss you so much at all. Maybe the number of miles, in sheep, could put mighty Big Apple to sleep, Maybe I could have said what I did over the wall. Maybe I'd fight and hurt myself, who knows, even die for you, Maybe it's what I'll say until the hour of judgement befall. The only holy certainty is that I'll be proud I ever knew you.      ",0
"1186","3435468","indUnk","       The other day the woman I loved told me that she was not special at anything that she was too normal. The true answer is that she is anything but normal. She is a woman of exceptional strenght because I have had to lean on her for the better part of two years now. She is the strength in our relationship, she took me from an angry and broken man too a man that wants to go forward and conquer the world. She has given me new hope and made me a person again, no longer is hate the ruling force in my life, she replaced it with love. Happiness is the gift that she brings to the world, and the vision of a better world is her voice. She see's the world for what it could and should be, that is not to say that she is naive or turns away from reality, she just knows that things are supposed to be better than what we make them. It is that idea, that vision that makes her ahead of her time. Di Venice and Shakespeare were both men who knew the human condition but ultimately believed that we where better than that, and that is what my love believes as well.

For those of you that do not know what it is or have questions about its name and what it is refered to across the world here is an explanation provided by a Mehndi artist.   Mehndi is the traditional art of adorning the hands and feet with a paste made from the finely ground leaves of the henna plant. The term refers to the powder and paste, and the design on the skin, as well as the party or ceremony. Henna is a small shrub called hawsonia inermis, and is also know as Henne, Al-Khanna, Al-henna, Jamaica Mignonette, Mendee, Egyptian Privet, and Smooth Lawsonia. Henna grows in hot climates and is found in India, Pakistan, Malaysia, Persia, Syria, Egypt, Morocco, Sudan and other North African, Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The leaves, flowers, and twigs are ground into a fine powder, then mixed with hot water. Various shades are obtainable by mixing with the leaves of other plants, such as indigo. Tea, coffee, cloves, tamarind, lemon, sugar, and various oils are also used to enhance the colour and longevity of design.                ",0

"1202","3420112","indUnk","        I'm not sure which is worse - having a dream about your ex-boyfriend masturbating and spraying the juice of his labour all over the bed and you and your sister, or having another dream immediately afterward about said ex-boyfriend as Homer Simpson who is placated when a chocolate bar is procured for him from a vending machine. Actually, I  am  sure which is worse. What I'm  not  sure about is why on earth I feel the need to post this on my blog.   &nbsp;   There's an innocence and absence of responsibility when it comes to dreams, I've decided. Ex-boyfriend, jism, and sister are merely symbols for unrelated ideas that happened to manifest (rather unfortunately) in a perverted dream, but that doesn't mean I think about things like that, any more than I think about Cuzzy being Homer and wanting some chocolate. Most likely I'm worried that my sister is in some kind of sticky situation and that Cuzzy doesn't always behave in ways that I approve of; and that Cuzzy sometimes wants something sweet and I sometimes know how to give it to him. Or Homer. That's my interpretation.   &nbsp;   How Freudian.   &nbsp;   How are you today?    Do you Yahoo!?   urlLink Yahoo! Mail  - 50x more storage than other providers!         ",0
"1203","3419049","Communications-Media","        urlLink    Being the youngest of a family that boasts of seven siblings it was only now that I realized that I am one of those (sort of...) unfortunate kids who were never given the chance to have a kid brother (or sister), for that matter though it may seem obscure of me to think of such you just got to wonder how it feels like, seeing as to how my nephew Arno would stand up for his little brother Ciro whenever I come to the verge of beating him to a pulp whenever we'd be wrestling ala-WWF in my parent's bedroom, really just makes me wonder what it would have been to have a little brother.     Now you may be asking why didn't I have a little brother, well to start with, my mother gave birth to me at a ripe old age of 46 years old and in medical circles that qualifies me as an menopause baby, which at that time made my family kind of nervous that I might turn up with autism, mental retardation, and the likes, but thank God that I turn out normal in terms of my physiology. So basically I grew up with my family where at the time live in the Republic of Cogeo Antipilo, where later on we moved to where we are now to this all normal looking house down the street of Malingap, Teacher's Village Quezon City where I spent most of my existing life with my parents, my sister's family and my Kuya Gerry who is twelve years older that I am.      Well, as I was saying earlier my childhood was almost as typical as any other kid would have lived it, though it wasn't that graced with typical Filipino games like text (which I most hated up to now because I really abhor the idea of gambling for children since I was raised in a very Christian home), tanching, patintero and a whole lot of other twenty something Pinoy games that I see from our gates as well as every time I would watch Batibot. Instead of text I collected those cards (especially the Marvel Super-Heroes series) and insted of playing tanching I played with action figures (GI Joes to be exact) and in place of patintero I would play dumbass soccer and Kamias Jevellin with my nephew Gato.      Yes, it was Gato, Arno's older brother who was only 5 years younger than me who lives just right behind our house, he was sort of for me a little brother since my closest brother was Kuya Gerry who was already way on his twenties during that time. What I remember with Gato is that we never ran out of things busy ourselves with every summer afternoon where we would bum ourselves with silly games, and 'comedy times' together with my dachshund Odie on my Kuya Gerry's bed, as well as when we'd both gather up our angst towards those fat bastard twins at AngTV and how I would hurl Odie at those two fatsos as if Odie were giving them a flying-kick; as well as to how we'd course like sailors whenever we'd see Pudong, Ginoong Boman, and Miss Minchin harass the protagonists of those cheaply dubbed cartoons in Channel 2, and how we both cried when we saw the death of Nelo and Patrash, and on that Christmas episode of Garfield where Odie spent his Christmas on the dog pound. Yes indeed it has always been Gato who'd be there with me during those countless afternoons where we'd be singing our hearts out to the Eraserheads' Ultraelectromagneticpop album, where it would eventually lead us (along with our dog Odie whom I try to give a voice by making Gato believe that it was really the dog who's talking by the way I would blurt out the dumbest stuff I could think of in that Weng Weng sounding voice) to our short-lived DIY recording career as standup comics (sort of like Porkchop Duo) aptly called Comedy Hodie & The Blackout Combo, where we'd be singing our favorite rendition of Oki-Doki Dok's theme song, complete with scratches and badass keyboards and rough guitar playing. Other than that we'd also make stupid mix tapes of that come from a single record that we'd often listen to and we'd pretend that it was a concert or something like that. And not to mention the times when I fondly get a copy of Gato's new homemade comic book that catalog's the continuing saga of Black Dogja, who is our personal adaptation of the Ninja Turtles, by merely twisting it to suit the characters of our two dogs Jiggy & Odie; other than that we also had the chance to bond and talk about the stupidest things ever like that time we thought of putting 'Le Ar' after the names of our dogs so that they'd be like Fuma Le Ar of Shaider. And how fun it is when we'd play WWF where I'll be Bret 'The Hitman' Hart and I'll be blurting out the silly phrase: 'I'm the best, I'm the best in the WWF' and he'll be playing Coco Be Ware. Or how we'd buy Mr. Fruit for the Ultraman cards that came with it and how we'd mix our Mr. Fruit candies with Sprite or how we'd stir our glasses of Coke with lollipops. Or how we'd purposely mismatch the vowels of specific words and names just because we thought it was funny like: the way we'd call our Uncle Gene, 'Uncle Jim' and then we'd replace the name Jimmy Santos with 'Jinnie Santos' or how we'd call a Genie a 'Jimmy', or how we'd mismatch the name of my niece Lea Grace with her dad Leo so that we'd call her 'Leo Grace'. Or how we'd never ran out of names to give to his dog Jiggy who as it turned out is also called Diego, Pupu, Huhu, Memeng, Eeng, Buakulaw and so on. As well as when we both cried when the vet have to put Jiggy to sleep because of his viral infection.     Or how he accidentally launched himself from the window towards their bed, wherein his head accidentally got struck with a Matchbox toy car, which really freaked out my Kuya Benjie who was watching over us at the time and how Gato fearlessly had his head injury stitched by some grouchy doctor. Or like how we spent a day bickering with our neighbor Miguiling just because he got hold of our toy airplane. Or how he stood up for me when Lea Grace's little brother Ejay called me a fag. Or how he stood up against our Tita Yoya because he knows that not everyone in our house agree with her decision to expand their place and build that monstrosity of a construction at our house's backyard.     I must admit I'm a little watery around the eye area right now since I really cherish those good old days when the world weren't that complicated and the only thing that matters at that time was just about making the most of the afternoon brownouts and the idea of Odie being able to get out of the gate every time my late Tita Yoya would arrive in our house at around 3 PM. And the fact that I'd never ran out of stories to tell about those afternoons really brings a lot of nostalgic memories during those innocent times. Well sure it would had also its share of downfalls when Gato and I would fight over Trading Cards, Toy Soldiers and GI Joes especially over that particular Hydro Viper figure, which really brought out the worst in us, and how sorry we both felt for each other when Gato accidentally flushed it on the toilet bowl. And we would fight over who owns which Matchbox and how we'd fight over that particular blue landroaver matchbox. Or how I hated him when I was blinded for two days when he chose to let go of the tennis racket that was attached to rubber band that we stretched from one end of the house to another.     And if I were asked with questions pertaining to who Gato is, all that I could say to them is that I see him as a guy that's driven with passion, from way back to being a 3 year old kid that's into dinosaurs so much that he's memorized each of them by heart, as well as to the diet of each dinosaur; Whether their are carnivorous or herbivores; up to his breakthroughs of finishing Megaman, Keen 4, Duke Nukem Mortal Combat 4 and X-Men: Children Of The Atom  (take not that he could do all the fatalities and make the hidden characters appear on the two latter games) way before me or Kuya Gerry were able to go advance to level 5 or something to that effect; or how he learned basketball which I utterly never learned and how he would mimic the dribbling technique of Kobe Bryant when we played it at church and on the basketball court in Claret. Up to the dude that he is now who's getting himself featured on TV for his unquestionable skill in skateboarding. Other than that is also the mere fact that I shared most of my first things with Gato, I got my first chance to go to Star City (for that Lost World of Dinosaurs Exhibit), Megamall (for the book fair); the first time to be a cartoon figure in one of the children's magazine that my sister was working on (I was featured as an explorer wearing a pair of glasses and Gato plays himself in the Gato at Gata comic strip); Robinson's Galleria and my first rock concert where we were able to watch the now obscure Claret band called The Weed and True Faith; as well as when he amazed me and my high school classmates with his impressive collection of NBA cards; not to mention the time when we both learned how to roller skate way before roller blades were the in thing. And how we both got to learn to love the sport of skateboarding and how he taught me to pop my first ollie on his Chicago skateboard, and how he first taught me to log into my brother's Internet account by typing this particular password that he deciphered by merely watching my brother type it. Another was the fact that he believed in me and had faith with what I do and can do, he was one of the very few loyal fans of Life Is Trying, and also of the silk screen venture that I did with Jeanie and my other friends; he was the one who took silly pictures of me and my friends on afternoons with his parents' camera, and how he never failed to listen and believe the most stupid stuff I said to him ranging from my stories about Dragonball Z to my silly stories about the kids at church and my elementary school classmates (especially of Ruel), to the stories I would tell him about a couple of guys named Juan, Pedro and Pepe which were also told to me by my classmates in elementary; to my adolescent rebellion in high school, to my adventures as a punk rocker in Tandem Recto, to my stories of slapstick skateboarding with my friends, and to my fling with student activism. He listened and never failed to hear out what I say. Another is that he always gave me a feeling that saw me as someone who dared to dream groundbreaking stuff and do it for kicks. And I find it at times flattering that whenever we'd encounter his skate-buddy Gino at Alberto's Studio, he'd tell me of how much he learned of me all because of the stories about me that Gato told him.  I also remember why it is no wonder that every time we'd play those role-playing games in high school he'd always be the front man and I'll always play the sidekick: he'd be Batman in his costume and I'd faithfully play Robin in my briefs; when we'd play The Wonder Years he'd be Kevin Arnold and I'd be Paul Pfiefer; when we'd play Parker Lewis, he'd be Parker and I'll be Parker's geeky four-eyed friend; and when we'd play Doogie Howser MD, he'd be Doogie and I'll be Vine Del Pino. And if you'd ask what this would mean to me is that because of the fact that I've always seen such potential in him when he was six years old he's already been publishing Black Dogja comics under his Vavi Comics line, while it took me the start of my second year in college to put out the first issue of my zine. When I just started learning Francis M's lyrics he was already well on his way rapping 'Meron Akong Ano'; and while I was struggling to lean how to do a running ollie on my skateboard he's already struggling on how to do a running kick flip on his skateboard. And how astounded I am by the fact that God has always blessed him in whatever activity it is that he decided to pour his heart into. Lastly I would also like to say that I've been told by a lot of people I know that he kinda looks like that pro-skater Bob Burnquist and come to think of it he really does look like him,     And right now as I see him going off to college, I see that there really is a lot in life in stored for him and though I may not be as close as I am to him nowadays I truly know I my heart that I wouldn't be much of the person that I am now if God did not allow Gato to play a special role in my life as a nephew, friend and as someone who's the closest to a little brother that I got, and I know that I have a lot of misgivings to him and that I wasn't as available as I am to him when he was growing up, and how I also became a bad example for him by making him a witness to all those unspeakable wicked deeds that I've done in the past, and how at times I'd be irritated with the way goes about in my room, I still really thank God for him, And also of how proud I am of him that he grew up to loving punk rock and not those twenty something hip-hop and lousy metal acts and for being himself and I hope that as I look back now I really want to thank him for all the memories and for whatever worth they may have all I can say is that it was worth all the while.

"1207","3416334","indUnk","       The pressure of writing this particular post is immense. I mean, this the first and, more than likely, the last time I even logon to this blog let alone publish anything. This work will define my blogging future. How will the masses who are certain to flock to this anonymous web page receive what I have to say? I am reminded that this is an exercise I must endure to save my friends and co-workers from my inflated sense of self importance and, that no one is actually reading this anyway.  I awoke this morning to the usual banter of a local talk radio show. You know the type. Some wannabe pundit mines the local paper a couple of minutes before going on the air and picks out a few topics which might actually generate controversy and interest, and then shares an uninformed, narrow-minded opinion thereby eliciting a response from a like-minded audience. And yes, I know that includes me.   Sometimes I laugh at the stupidity, sometimes I am angered by it, and sometimes I actually agree with it. This morning, however, I had to fight my inner demons to avoid making that all too frequent â€œfirst time callerâ€ mistake of actually picking up the phone and dialing the number to call and voice my opinion.   The really amazing thing about my reaction is that I have no personal interest in the topic, â€œShould gay couples be allowed to marry?â€. I am not married and I am not gay. I am not aware that any of my friends or relatives is gay. In short, I have no horse in that race but yet here I am some 13 hours later still rambling on about it.  Should any two law abiding adults who are in love with each other and want to spend the rest of their lives together be denied the legal rights and responsibilities that are bestowed upon married couples? Of course not. Any other answer is indefensible. Let me see if I can tackle a few of the popular conservative objections being raised on the right.  The most common reason against gay marriage that I hear is that it will diminish family values in some way. This argument is stupid on so many levels it is difficult to respond. How does anything I do affect your family values? Can someone please explain to me how the marriage of Adam and Steve will somehow diminish the bond of Adam and Eve? Please donâ€™t try and confuse this issue by citing some study about how children need a mom and a dad. That is a separate matter and in case you were unaware, the â€œshould gays be allowed to raise childrenâ€ battle was waged years ago and guess what, gay people can be parents too.  Next, I often hear an argument that goes something like â€œMarriage is an institution that has been around for thousands of years and we ought not to tinker with the definition of it.â€ While that may be a fact it doesnâ€™t necessarily make an argument. I do not spend much time trying to judge the actions or standards of prior generations. I can only assume they did the best they could with what they knew and what they had to work with. Just because something has been unchanged for thousands of years doesnâ€™t negate the possibility that there is a better way. History is replete with examples of bad institutions which needed change (slavery comes to mind). Our society is changing and our laws must keep up. Homosexuals make up a significant and growing portion of our society. Whether the actual number is 1% or 10% we are talking about a large portion of our people who need and deserve the legal rights our society gives to married couples.  Lately Iâ€™ve heard a lot of the â€œwe canâ€™t allow gay marriages because it will create a legal quagmireâ€ argument. There is some truth in this belief. The Constitution requires states to honor the laws of other states, meaning that a marriage legal in one state probably must be recognized by others. This will undoubtedly lead to a horrific glut of litigation in family courts and possibly criminal courts as well. But should we deny basic rights to individuals because our laws are backwards or should we pass progressive laws to protect the rights of these individuals?  The truth about this entire deliberation is that it is not about gay marriage. This is a morality attack on gays. This is about a portion of our population disapproving of a particular lifestyle. This is a war that was fought decades ago and some of my fellow citizens sadly cannot accept their defeat. One reason I know that I am right is that those who publicly oppose gay marriage rarely have the intellectual honesty or the courage to come right out and say it. Why not just say that homosexuality is an aberration to your particular god and that you believe homosexuality is a sin? The reason you donâ€™t is because you know that a religious argument has little merit in a secular nation and can only serve to alienate those with different religious beliefs.  Some have suggested that â€œcivil unionsâ€ (a legal status that isnâ€™t marriage but grants the legal rights and responsibility of marriage) might be the answer. Didnâ€™t we try separate but equal already? Letâ€™s give these people the full acceptance and recognition our diverse society allows. Life is just too short to spend it limiting the rights of others.  The real silliness about this debate is the timing of the recent public outcry. Unfortunately for those who think this cultural battle is just getting started, this race is over. The momentum behind the acceptance of gay marriage is unstoppable. More and more cities and states will allow these unions and because of the full faith and credit provisions of the Constitution others will be forced to accept it. Trying to undo recent events would be like trying to re-institute slavery or taking the right to vote away from women. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle and you canâ€™t unring this bell.           ",0

"1213","3415523","Internet","        ''I glance at the headlines just to kind of get a flavor for what's moving. I rarely read the stories, and get briefed by people who are probably read the news themselves.''       --George W. Bush, Washington, D.C., Sept. 21, 2003  Reading a techie novel is something which doesnâ€™t really inspire me (after all why would I read something which I do for a living?!). However not counting that, with 3 more techie novels which I have to finish (since I have bought them), and also with a hope that some combination of keys which I am typing doesnâ€™t cause the notorious Office XP to hang and crash, I proceed therefore to review, which is actually, well, about a BUG. Now, for hopeful environmentalists here or some bug expert, first and foremost, this is a book about a BUG as in the world of computers; sorry to disappoint you, but this BUG lives in the machine world, and unlike objects of curiosity of its lively counterparts, the BUGS in machine world excel at making you gape with horror, shock, amazement, irritation, anger, loath, hatred, and have you tear your hair apart for its sheer capacity to tease you when you expect it the least.    Whatâ€™s worse than finding a bug in a program? Catch the next computer programmer beside you and ask.    Ellen Ullman  herself has been a programmer for around 20 years, and now a days writes for various magazines and has a fan following. So when she decided to write a fiction novel set in the techie world, eyebrows were raised as to how would she come up with something that was easily accessible to readers in all domains, and still avoid the smirk of the geeks. While she succeeds at both, her intrinsic sense of programmer gets the better of her at many places, there by making geeks happier than others. However that should not deter people from other fields to try out the books, however the audience acceptance will definitely be amongst computer literate, and of course anyone familiar with C and the ubiquitous monster UNIX (which perhaps is the best thing the machines could have ever asked for).    THE BUG   A BUG can be anything in your program â€“ a simple pointer going haywire, your memory allocation going berserk, or even a simple loop which instead of terminating after 10 iterations, decides it doesnâ€™t want to. Of course bugs are caught sooner or later, with â€˜laterâ€™ being an infinite concept of time; Its the harrowing time between finding the cause of the bug that makes life miserable. Like any other BUG, once found, it usually is a ridiculous piece of code which just happened to be there.   While itâ€™s a simple one line story, I am sure the geeks here appreciate the horror of the predicament.    There is a bug in the system which causes the application to crash at random times due to random input responses.   The book well, is about finding that elusive bug and correcting it. Simpler said than done eh?   REPRODUCTION   One of the toughest things you can encounter with random BUGS is the reproduction. If you cannot reproduce an error, or more appropriately, the BUG itself, then you donâ€™t know where to start. If you cannot see the â€˜effectâ€™ of the BUG again and again, chances are you will never the â€˜causeâ€™ too   The BUG deeply explores an era set in time when Graphical User Interfaces were becoming famous â€“ a story set back in the programming world of mid 1980s when the root ruled (pun intended). The backdrop of the company, programming an interface for their latest database is going through all the typical chaos of a company trying to get a product to market. A typical scene of a techie company is superbly narrated -  a bunch of programmers coding a application, sending over their modules to testers, who then will return with BUGS, and programmers correcting the BUG until an acceptable level of tolerance is reached and the software is released in the market,  with  BUGS un-discovered or intentionally, for some newer person to find it and report it back. (In a lighter vein, I wonder if Windows XP development team ever had a testing team!)  Reverting back to book again, a BUG which surfaces out of nowhere, creates havoc amongst the life of the tester and a programmer respectively. A superb narration of a (rather clichÃ© American) life of the programmer makes for compulsive reading - the trials, the hopelessness, the frustrations of not finding out the BUG and correcting and it and overall mental tiredness of trying to catch something beyond your control, all the emotions are superbly captured by a one time programmer herself, giving it more scope and understandability  â€“ I guess it take a programmer to feel a programmer.   CAUSE   Sometimes BUGS may require as simple a step as declaring your variables from one data type to another. At times a simple change which took care of one BUG, doesnâ€™t necessarily mean you wont face another BUG caused by the effect of the change. In real world systems, there is no such thing as a perfect software system â€“ even mission critical software have bugs, and as the author brilliantly points towards the end â€“ its there, waiting, lurking behind the doors, may be weeks, may be years, to strike at that opportune moment when it shouldnâ€™t and create havoc. If you are lucky you will never see it.    The explanation right from the first page is pretty technical with oodles of UNIX and C programming thrown in â€“ that an attempt is also made to make the novice reader understand the happenings is an appreciable effort by the author. While taking a parallel to the BUG, the author also vividly paints out images of techie world to the readers â€“ the constant head-banging deadlines, the eagerness to release half finished products, the layoffs, venture capitalists, role changes, almost every aspect of a techie company is brought about as an undertone in the book, making it immensely enjoyable. She also perfectly captures the feelings of a human when dealing with a BUG and the art of debugging the BUG. Probably as a mistake or may be an intentional trick, the author leaves a BUG in the BUG for the readers to grasp. I admit I had to see again to find that BUG!    TEST   Once a bug has been dealt with, you cannot clasp your hands with wonder. For you never know what you may face next. Sometimes you can predict  what will occur, a newer bug may awake, where that bug will occur and so on, however its what you cannot predict you should be scared of. A software without bugs is a BUG itself, and probably useless â€“ thatâ€™s a fundamental nature of software, in a lighter vein that is!   In short, let me just state that the book has been a very enjoyable read for me, and even if you are not a geek, you should read this for pure thrilling narrative. On the only flip side of the novel is the language which goes from first person to third, from past to present and future in an eccentric manner. But that is probably just about it. On the whole, the BUG is a very a good read, and if you are from the geek world, then this is one book you must read!   Ps: I have and clearly avoided mentioning any part of the philosophical jingo in the book â€“ its eminently enjoyable and very true to todayâ€™s world which is ruled by computers and not humans.

Gonna be rushing like mad.. how am I able to generate a case in 2 days?!?!?! maybe if I dun sleep?? but oh well, it'll all be over in just 7 more days.. can't wait for that to come...  Anyway, I noticed something about me... I tend to wear blue on Mondays.... I guess it kinda fits the term 'Monday Blues' haha.... Ever wonder where the term Monday Blues come from??? from Garfield maybe?? since it hates monday so much?? and why blue?? why not pink, yellow or black or gray??????? why Blue???? kinda curious recently.. =P  Anyway, started the day on a tired note.. dunno why.. just feel so tired everyday no matter how much I sleep.. just what is wrong???? but oh well.. maybe I'm really burn out...  On the whole.. the ave grading for today was only 6 out of 10.. What makes it a 6 and not a 10?? (Typical qns to be ask by my coach) Well, cos halfway through the day.. kinda got irritated?? and I start to wonder.... is there something that I did wrong?? or am I being too nice??? or am I simply too naive.. Why is it that just when one decides to forgive and forget.. the whole cycle starts again?!?! or could it be becos he reminds me too much of him??????? of the pain and the hurt?? and subconsciously though I keep thinking that it is not due to his presence that things have change..    'Confronting the truth' is what he once told me.. but where's my chance of truth?? who can tell me the truth?? Though I have decided not to pursue the truth but is it really what I wanted?? or could it be that I'm just fearful of the truth.. but one thing for sure is that not knowing the truth could have cause the cycle.. the way I see the situation and the way I react.. could staying away be the only way to make my life better?? or happier....

"1217","3413775","indUnk","       So what a day it's been.  I woke up this morning with a killer charley horse in my leg, and man I have been walking around like a gimp for at least a week now since I also broke three toes.  Eventually I made it out of bed, because while laying there bordering between sleep and conciousness I thought, 'Fuck.  I want a steak.'  So off I went to Texas Roadhouse.  So I get there and there's people packed tight in the waiting area, so I go 'Oh no.. This is ridiculous.'  Turns out it was a party of thirty six!  So I got seated right away and proceeded to get the biggest steak on the menu.  It was   damn   good.  The baked potato was disgusting because they poured sour cream on it.  That thing had about 5 inches of sour cream on it.  That's about how my day went.  Am I the only one who is completely fed up with William Hung? I mean come on.  The guy can't sing, he can't dance, and his novelty sure as hell has worn off by now.  Yes, don't get me wrong, but the first 500 times he sang She Bangs, I chuckled.  Now it's just getting ridiculous.  I am growing more and more weary of the leadership of this country.  I read an article today about a possible reinstating of the draft today and I just can not believe that they would do that.  It would be political suicide and it's not worth sending cannon fodder to an obvious lost cause like Iraq.  If I was ever called, I would go, but I would always have a grudge.  We have already lost this war.  It's exactly like Vietnam.  We are winning the battles on the ground, but we're losing them strategically.  When we launched the Tet offensive in Vietnam, we thought we had wiped out the Viet Cong.  Which we did for the most part.  We absolutely destroyed them militarily, but it was a huge propaganda victory for the Viet Cong.  These people are more than extremists.  To kill one American is a small victory for them, and all we are doing is giving them more opportunities.  Let Iraqi's handle Iraqi problems.  I think we did right in getting Saddam, but did I wake up in fear of Saddam everyday? Fuck no.  I didn't give him a second thought.  What he did to the Kurds sucked and all, but he didn't affect my life in the least.  I am registering to vote this year, and I don't even know who I will vote for.  I am losing faith in both candidates so who knows?  But I know if I don't vote, then I have no right to bitch.  So I am going to vote, so I can at least say 'Yeah, well at least I voted.'  So last night, I saw Fleetwood Mac.  What a great night.  I've always dug them somewhat, but last night put me over the top.  One of the only downsides was some drunk guy behind me tapped me on the back and was like 'Yo man, sit down.  It's better on the monitor dude.'  So I said, I paid 100 bucks for my ticket and I have the right to stand up if I can't see.  If you can't see then stand up.  It's not my fault your wife is too short.  This lady in front of us had the most annoying ear rings I have ever seen.  They looked like raver ear rings with blinking lights.  Not to mention, that our section was fucking Grand Central Station.  Every two seconds someone went to get beer, or something.  I was like fucking sit down and watch the show.  If you want to drink beer, then do it at home.  It's much cheaper and more fun that way.  The only major dowside was that my mom was not there to see it.  When they played Landslide I thought about her and her memory.  She always loved Stevie Nicks, and not to sound like a sap, but when she first came on, I got a little choked up when I saw her because it reminded me of mom and mom's love for her.  I could of done without the last song though.  Not that it was a bad song, but it was a sad song.  They had a motif in the song about togetherness and the line went 'Someday we will be together again'.  As long as we're on the subject, when I get some money, I was going to get some guy to make the poem Ascension into a plaque type thing so I can have a copy to hang on my wall with my mom's picture.  Ascension, has got to be one of the best poems I have ever read.  Read and decide for yourself:   And if I go while you're still here, Know that I live on, vibrating to a different measure. Behind a thin veil, you cannot see through. You will not see me, so you must have faith. I wait for the time, when we can soar together again both aware of each other. Until then live your life to the fullest, And when you need me... Just whisper my name in your heart, and I will be there.    That poem was by Colleen Corah Hitchcock.  What a first post this was.  I think I am going to end now.  But leave me comments.  Music Currently Playing: Head Club by Taking Back Sunday         ",0

"1223","3403444","indUnk","       Mary-Kate Olsen Enters a Rehab Facility  Teen actress Mary-Kate Olsen, who is alarmingly thin, has checked into a treatment facility for an undisclosed 'health-related issue,' her spokesman said in a statement issued to the media on Tuesday. Although he was not any more specific than this, PEOPLE Daily says that health-related issue is an eating disorder.  See a recent photo of Mary-Kate Olsen signing autographs before the premiere of 'New York Minute.'  Mary-Kate and her twin sister, Ashley, turned 18 on June 13, a birthday that boosted their bank accounts by some $150 million as they reached the age of majority. They enter New York University as freshman in the fall. Spokesman Michael Pagnotta would only say this: 'Mary-Kate Olsen recently entered a treatment facility to seek professional help for a health-related issue. She is thankful for the encouragement and support of her friends and family who are with her every step of the way.'  See a photo of Mary-Kate snuggling with her boyfriend, David Katzenberg, son of DreamWorks studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg.  Amid much speculation in recent months, the twins have adamantly denied there is a problem. In a PEOPLE magazine cover story published in May, Ashley defensively said, 'Being in the public eye, you're labeled that you have an eating disorder. You have a drug addiction. We don't have problems! There's nothing to worry about.' Then Mary-Kate added, 'If I had a drug addiction, I would be in a thingy--like Promises, the Malibu (rehab) place. You don't see me there. So, like, come on. It's crazy.'          ",0

"1228","3402720","indUnk","             Sports in Baltimore one could argue is the best in the country.  After attending the Yankee game this week with 44 of our good friends one would be convinced Baltimore has done it stadiums right. From the Inner Harbor to the stadium itself. Hotels, restaurants, bars, parking.  We have attended sporting events in many cities across the country and although we have fun poking at Baltimore it is alot more fun to go to a Ravens game then a Redskins game. The owner is cooler also.  Even my favorite Yankee Stadium can not compare to the experience of Camden Yards. The Inner Harbor has something over the Bronx. Not quite sure what exactly....is this heresey?  Game 6 against the Braves is like nothing I ever experienced, but I would of rather of went to Pickles to celebrate then run for our lives to Manhattan. Although Wanda meeting Gary Maddux and half of the Brave team in the hotel bar at 5 am after they lost is a story in itself.

"1233","3400405","indUnk","             Oh my, I feel like a different person.  I have been so keyed up for the last 6 weeks that I forgot that I am a generally happy person.  I still have the crick in my neck from all the stress but it may begin to go away now.  My darling husband is back here!  I feel lost without him now.  It is wild to think that a strong woman can become such that the loss of a partner can make her weak.  I don't like being weak.  I like it when I am sure of myself.  Know what I am doing and where I am going.  And I understand that these down times are challages that I am overcoming.  Bit by bit.  But that is how it is for all of us.  Shoot by our fourties we are no longer doing hurdles and long jumps.  More of a skip here and there at best.  Also we know that there are traps we can fall into if we do not examine the path closely.  Use to be able to get out of them easier but now our climbing has slowed down and we tend to be more careful.  Nothing wrong with that.  But I still mark milestones with drastic measures.  Don't know if I will ever learn not to do that.  This last 6 weeks has taught me how much my husband does mean to me.  It is not enough (for some reason) to just have a wedding ring on to note I am his.  Or his last name attached to mine.  I wanted something more.  Something daring.  That would be just for him to see.  Hummmm.  Wonder why I at 40 I am looking for such drastic measures.  Is it my own mid life crisis telling me I am not young anymore.  Wanting to feel like a 20 year old who is just looking at life?  I know I may regret it, but I really dont feel that way at this time.  Have to say (sad to have to though) that this is my last husband.  I do not like knowing that I have failed in marriage before.  I understand the first one.  We knew we would not last.  Miss him so, he was a great friend.  Too bad he could not hold on to his life and see what we all saw in him.   But when I married my daughter's dad, well that was suppose to be it.  15 years is not like we did not try.  But we were both so sad togeather.  And now my happiness could not be more appreciated.  Still I had to do something this time to get my life jump started again.  So why a tattoo?  Pretty permant I would say.  And a name on it.  They always say do not put a name on.  Guess I really do feel that this is it in the hubby department.  Well one day I will be older and laugh at my wicked ways.  Funny I dont think this will be on the top of the list.  But I am sure it will always put a smile on my lips when I think of it and him.  Not a bad way to affirm I am alive and happy once again.         ",0

"1241","3393193","indUnk","           As a recommended blog topic, you asked us what we think of the idea of 'English only'.  I won't go on and repeat what's been said over and over again, by saying that the U.S. was not first inhabited by English speakers, therefore there is no basis for the notion that all American's should speak only English.  But, I did say it anyways.  Obviously language is a component of any culture.  You don't necessarily have to speak a language to reside in any country.  I believe that those who protest that anybody who can't speak English should not be allowed to live here are retarded.  Scientifically speaking.  It's my experience that almost every time I've heard such a statement being made, it was made by someone who was just inconvenienced by someone else's lack of English speaking skill.  For example, at McDonalds.  In my opinion, they made the negative remarks as a cover for their own embarassment.  They were unable to communicate effectively with the cashier, and instead of feeling awkward at the situation, they poke fun at him/her instead to either get a laugh, or to appear superior.  It's also part of the whole, 'fear of anything different' concept that's going around.  However, I'd like to add that I have seen in my experience, that we as Americans are actually doing a rather good job of acception different people into our culture, as compared to many more conservative ones.  I believe the U.S. is doing it right.  You don't have to speak the language to live here, but you are required to have a basic understanding of it to become a citizen.  Afterall, language is part of the culture, and you are, by applying to become a citizen, accepting that culture.           ",0
"1242","3392873","Fashion","       dear philly,  i remember bak to 1987, but only because of pretzel day.  wednesday was pretzel day.  it was a wonderful thing.  after school, i would frolic in a pretzel playground to the tune of 10 cents a piece.  many pretzels were had.  many. perhaps someone should have taken some pretzels down to your ice mates, the flyers.  in 87 you'll remember, the flyers were busy losing the stanley cup.  again.  they had taken a one year break from presenting someone else the cup in 1986, after their true to form performance in 1985.  that was after getting the islanders going in 1980, and sparking the canadiens in 1976.  both of those teams went on to win 4 consecutive cups.  even though the oilers didn't win 4 cups in a row, they did beat your flyers twice, so that kind of atoned for it.  then in 1997, just to prove that they hadn't forgotten their hospitality, the flyers got the red wings off their 42 year stanley cup winning snide by giving them the cup in 4 games. knowing all of that, it's good to know that your boys didn't make it to the cup this year.  see, the flames haven't won the cup in 15 years, so it would have been about time for them to cash in their philly chips.  you should send along an apology to calgary.  you've really thwarted some of her chances.  i'm sure you know better than me that that's just the tip of the iceberg with your sports teams.  if it's not the eagles losing the NFC championship game 3 years in a row (not to mention having one of the most dismal teams in the history of the league (thank you cardinals!)), then it's the phillies winning one championship in 100 years.  i really don't understand.  first of all, if you ever see boston, please kick him in the balls.  all i ever hear is griping: 'we can't win a world series.  we have our heads shoved way up our asses.  we're stupid and deserve a title.'  eat shit boston.  you've only won about 48 basketball titles, and your football squadron has somehow squeaked out 2 of the last 3 super bowls (did i mention the eagles didn't make it to those super bowls because they were busy losing championship games?).  sorry phil, i'm really not even a flyers fan anymore.  i just think it's kind of sad at this point.  and as the days get longer, my eyes do their normal turn from an ice-bound loss to a hopeful field of fortune.  this is the time of year where the jerseys come off, and the Phillies caps are dragged bak out, hoping that this year will be different.  anyway phil, not really sure where i'm headed with this.  just wanted to know what makes you so different.  why is it that miami can have a baseball team for 10 years and win the series one more time than we have since 1880whatever?  why do we spend all our time hosting other dynasties?  how come a team from carolina can roll in to your humble dwellings and rock a team that just completed a 4th and 26?  why didn't we hit the homerun in game 6 in 93 to send it to a seventh game?  why wasn't anyone shocked when any of that happened?  so if you could get bak to me, that would be great.  love, ziks  ps, also, could you send a detailed guide of what to do in the case that the phillies win the series this year.  it's been about 20 years, and we really don't know how to react to winning.  thanks  z         ",0

"1246","3389862","indUnk","             Today is Dylan's first day at the local elementary school.  The school runs an experimental year-round calendar so the first term begins in August.  We've recently got used to sleeping in a bit later so we set our alarm clock for the first time in several years to make sure we were ready in time. With a little flurry of activity, we were out of the house at 7.45 walking up to end of the road for the bus.  Dylan & I walked on ahead; I was anxious about missing the bus & quizzed Dylan about the name of his teacher and the number of his classroom. Amanda tagged behind and Grandma &amp; Grandpa Goodsell brought up the rear. The large yellow bus arrived a couple of minutes early & Dylan leapt on and ran to a seat halfway down, waving out of the window as the bus pulled away. Brody bawled at the unexpected departure of Dylan and we all walked back home.   As I drove off to work I looked at my watch,  8.05am, and felt a pang of anxiety as I imagined Dylan arriving at the large school. I'm sure he'll be OK.          ",0
"1247","3389671","indUnk","       Okay. So, in my last post I said I had a meeting with my boss that I thought was going to be bad. It was. Due to my non-stop lateness and over the top internet useage I've been suspended for two days. While I think that suspension was a little harsh I could use a little time off. The only thing that bugs me is that I'm not the only one in my department that does this stuff. I'm just the most obvious one. Hell one person plays flash games all day. Another gets off the phone from yelling at his wife just long enough to call someone regaurding his after hours work. Ohh well, I guess that's what it means to be low man on the totem pole.   Enough about that, now it's time to tell about me being hasseled by the man. The other night I was driving home from playing some pool and I see a cop driving around, I say to Isabella, 'He's going to pull me over'. Low and behold he does. I wasn't doing anything wrong, nothing at all. He tell me that the computer says that my registration is expired. Just to make it totally clear, I had registred my car a week previous and considering that the police had a connection to the DMV computers right in their car I find it hard to believe that my registration is showing up as expired. He eventually lets me go.  Last night, just two nights after the first incident, after leaving a pool tournament (which I didn't win) I see a cop, and he sees me walking to my car. He pulls around in a parking lot and waits for a few seconds watching me, then he leaves and goes up the street out of sight. He's out of sight for all of five seconds and I see his front end creep around the corner watching me start my car and let it warm up for a minute. The second I drive off he's on my ass. I  LOVE  it when cops tailgate me! So I try to be carefull not to do anything stupid but in the end I kinda do. I'm at a red light and and I see a car coming but it looks far enough away that I think I can safely turn right. The cop didn't agree. He pulled me over and asked for my license. This piqued my interest because he didn't ask for my registration. I would have thought that if my registration was showing up as expired he would have said something about it, but even after checking the computer and coming back with my license he didn't ask for it. He just told me to yeild next time and let me go.   God I love the cops in Benicia. I live in Vallejo and drive around that city all the time, at all hours but never get pulled over there. I go one town over and it happens quite often.          ",0

"1250","3386364","Science","                 I've decided that as part of my work (computer simulation of hemispherical electron analysers) that i should write about the repairing of surfboards. Obviously, it's not directly related, but it's going to act as mental chewing gum, and get me salivating (mentally) before i write a geometry file for a Herzog plate... less said about that, the better methinks. Anyway, onto the issue at hand...  You will need: 1. A surfboard, dinged 2. Resin, either polyester or epoxy... epoxy is better but more expensive 3. Catalyst 4. Glass cloth or tape... 5. Numerous other bits that you'd never suspect you'd need. Just go round the house with a bucket and collect whatever catches your eye. Pins, cutlery, a mug, CDs, stuffed toys, bog roll, cushions, tomatoes and a bunch of keys are all good things to collect at this point.  This is what to do: 1. Find a suitable location in the sun, out the rain, preferably well-ventilated 2. Put the board on the ground. Squat next to it to appear professional 3. Rummage through your bucket of stuff. Hopefully, there will be a sharp knife in there 4. Use the knife to pick off any loose bits of resin around the ding 5. Have another rummage in bucket. Find sandpaper 6. Sand around the ding - this is to provide a rough surface the resin can stick to... 7. Chase away next doors cat who has come to watch 8. Find a pot. Or a mug. If you can't find a pot, find some pot and give up for the day 9. Have a guess at how much resin you're going to need for the repair. Double it, then double it again. Any surplus will be distributed about yourself, most of your possesions and the cat that's just come back 10. Put a few drops of catalyst in the resin. Again, this is a guess, and must once more be quadrupled 11. Find something like a spatula. Butter knives are good, tv remote controls are not. 12. Splat some of the resin on the ding, and work it in quite well. Make sure to leave at least one air bubble in it. This is so anyone who inspects your work has something to point out. If you omit the bubble, people will get annoyed at you for being too good. If you have no friends, by all means get rid of the bubble. 13. Scratch around the yard for some grit and other cack. Sprinkle onto the resin. This is for similar reasons to the air bubble. 14. Lay the glass cloth over the ding. Prod it with your spatula type thing to ensure it gets (mainly - unsoaked bits are similar to the bubble and cack) soaked with resin. Slop more resin on top of it, and work that in, too. 15. This is a good time to notice that it's started raining, and also that next doors cat  is stuck to the pot of resin. 16. Carry board indoors, making sure you pick it up by the wet resin, and liberally spread it around the furniture. 17. Attempt to separate cat from pot of resin, get bitten for your efforts. Bite the cat back if you're feeling energetic. 18. Wait for board to dry.  19. In the meantime, leave resiny fingerprints around the house. This is a good time to read a book, make some sandwiches or just sit and stroke your beard. If you don't have a beard, consider growing one. They are indispensible for containing half-set resin. 20. Is the repair set? It will not be. Leave for a bit longer 21. Find the sandpaper again and sand the repair smooth. And the big dribble of resin next to it. 22. Clear up. This will involve leaving the resiny mug outside for a week, and hiding the remote control and swearing you haven't seen it for a few days. 23. Admire your handiwork, drink some beer.

"1252","3383594","Student","       Yesterday was a pretty stressful day for me. I had Chinese tuition during the noon time and I continued studying all the way till about 6pm. I'm pretty proud of myself though, cus I dun usually spend tt much time on Chinese. L0L!  I met my Pri Sch fren at 6pm and we went to West Mall. We had dinner at Burger King and did a lot of catching up. We were basically talking about our lives and how it had changed since the last time we met. We spent like half an hour at Burger King juz relaxing and catching up. After tt, we were off to shopping!  First, we went to Giodarno. I got a pair of ankle socks there for $6, which was to my judgement, extremely expensive. Next, we went to Watsons, where I bought a L'Oreal FX Studio hair cream. It cost me $10.30!!! OMG! Well, hair products are always so damn expensive anyway, but there was a 20% discount, if not it would haf been $12.90! We proceeded to Popular next, so tt I could pick up some stationery. I juz bought a stapler and a pen. We went up to Sembangwan Music next to check out on the latest albums and stuffs, but didn't buy anything. We made our way to Bata next, also known as, Buy And Throw Away. I bought a pair of shoes there, which cost me $30.  After we came out of Bata, I realised tt the Giodarno ankle socks was gone. I had no idea if I dropped it or if some1 stole it. *Sighz* So, we went to another shop in West Mall to get ankle socks. The shop sold 1 pair of ankle socks at $1.90, which was so much cheaper. I decided to buy 2 pairs since it was so cheap. Well, like I always say, you win some and you lose some. I lost when I lost the Giodarno ankle socks, but I won when I found a shop tt sold cheaper ankle socks. So it wasn't tt bad after all. L0L! I total up my spendings for the day and it amounted to $61! OMG! L0L! But, it's alrite, even my mum agreed wif me. She said it was alrite cus I onli go shopping like once or twice a yr, so it doesn't realli matter. L0L!  *** Important Update On My Injury *** Yesterday I went to see a doc in the morning. I was realli hoping tt my injury didn't haf anything to do wif my bones. I juz didnt wan any dislocated, fractured or broken shitz. L0L! In the end, the doctor said tt it was juz the muscle, nothing serious, but it would take weeks to recover. But when he was massaging tt part tt hurts, the pain was horrible. Haha, so I realised tt if some1 was to actually squeeze tt part, it would probably hurt like hell.

"1253","3383594","Student","       The day was pretty alrite. It started off wif A Maths. Mr Lee Han Seng was our new teacher for those who got below 35 for mid-yr. He's not bad, seriously, I managed to pay attention during those 2 periods for the first time in like a yr plus. I also did the homework I was given. Haha, well tt's a start since a yr. Will it pay off in the end? Nah! L0L!  For Social Studies, this new teacher replaced Mrs Zamree and was pretty alrite I suppose. She doesn't seem to haf control of the class though, den again, who does? Not many, tt's 4 sure. After S.S was Geography and we all had to go to the hall. There was this banding system tt was gonna take place for all the sec 4 express. We were going to be split to 3 classes. The first class would be in 4E1, second in 4E2 and third in 4E3. Only Eddy and Alvin got into the first class. Some went into the second and most in the third class. Malbindar and lil' pig were in the third class. Unfortunately, I was in the second class. I wanted to change class, not cuz of my frens, but cuz of the teachers. Mrs Ng took the third class and Mr Leong took my class. I kindda understand and do betta when Mrs Ng teaches me. In the end, I swapped wif Abbas as he preferred Mr Leong's style of teaching and wanted to get to my class.  During P.E, the whole cls couldn't find the damn teacher, so all of us juz went our own way. Some went for an early recess, some went back to cls and I dunnoe where da hell the rest went. L0L!  After recess was Basics, which was pretty cool. It was basically a slack lesson and there wasn't much to do. After 2 periods, we had to go for our health screening in the art room. When we got there, there were still other ppl in there, so we had to wait outside. I was squating outside the back door of the cls room. Fat pussy cat came along and wad do u noe? He planted his fat balloon-liked ass on my rite leg. He's realli some heavy shit man. After awhile I was in a sitting position and he was enjoyin it. He obviously doesn't noe how FAT he is! L0L! He kept bouncing as well, but luckily he got up after 5mins. If he would haf sat longer, my rite leg would haf decomposed due to his fat stinky ass! L0L! So I'll definitely consider myself lucky, and furthermore, I'm lucky tt it's the leg and not anywhere else. Hopefully he doesn't do anything to me wif tt ass of his anymore and hopefully he doesn't read this. L0L!  The health screening started off wif the eye checkup, which was my fav as I haf a perfect vision. L0L! Den came the blood pressure thing, the nurse who took mine said it was high, but later on another nurse said it wasn't high, but it was good. So I'm pretty lost, but I dun care bout' tt. The best thing was tt the nurse said I WAS skinny, but not anymore! So guys, get it straight, I'm NOT skinny! Haha, my clsmates wasted time in the art room so we didnt haf to go for Chinese. When we got back to cls, there wasn't any teacher, so we slacked till the end of the day.  All the sec 4 express classes had to attend some maths briefing immediately after sch. It lasted for like 15mins. Mr Lee Han Seng was juz like tellin us not to skip focus and stuffs. I wasn't realli paying attention, but the bottomline was tt we are not suppose to skip focus anymore unless we haf a valid reason. After tt, Me and Malbindar went to the hawker centre for lunch. Some of my clsmates joined us and at tt point I felt kindda uncomfortable, so I ate my food fast and both me and Mal left b4 any1 else cld do so. Lil piggy told me he was gonna take 176, but I didn't want to due to certain reason, so I juz said I had to go. I feel pretty guilty bout' it, so sorry my dear brother.

I'm an Intrapersonal thinker... meaning:  I spend a lot of time thinking about and trying to understand oneself. (I think I've gone pass this stage already. I got tired of it i guess. Now I only think about walking along the woods, riding a chopper, having a room built on top of the sea, a full moon lighting our beach camp, being on top of a mountain, lounging on the asotea while tracking the stars, feeling warm on a cold Baguio peak, etc...)  I reflect on my thoughts and moods, and work to improve them. (I try to be passive. I now realize that I am what i choose to be. I do not dwell on ill feelings, ill thoughts.)  I understand how my behaviour affects my relationships with others. (Damn if you do. Damn if you don't. I have seen how my actions stir up the awkwardness, the uncertainty, the fear amidst my circle.  Other Intrapersonal thinkers include  Sigmund Freud, Gandhi, Grahame Greene  Careers which suit Intrapersonal Thinkers include Psychologist, Teacher, Pilot, Child Care worker, Explorer, Drama therapist (A few years from now, I'm most likely to be in Child Care, either caring for my own born or perhaps running a day care.

"1258","3378480","indUnk","       This game I found in an educational store, so that must mean it is boring, right? Well, the theme isn't the funnest in the world, but the game is actually pretty fun.  Each player is trying to set up a 10 day trip by walking, driving or flying. You can move to another state next to a state by walking. By driving, it allows you to skip one full state. Flying, is even better, allowing you to fly to different states of the same color as the airplane's color.  There is a lot of luck in playing this game. After each player takes cards one by one to fill their iternery (as I like to call it,) players take turns drawing a card from one of the 3 face up piles or the face down draw pile and then the card drawn is discarded into one of the 3 face up piles or takes the place of one of the days, and the card replaced gets put in one of the three discard piles. There always have to be a card in each face up discard pile, so if you take the last card from a pile, you must place the one you replace it with in the same pile.  How you set up your cards in the beginning is key to the game, since you can never move your cards during the game, except by placing a card you want to move onto the discard pile and hoping the other players don't cover it up before you can pick it up and put it on another day.  The game plays quickly and usually the hard part is getting the last state you need. It can get pretty competitve at times and you probably will have to change directions sometimes to get what you need.  I think this game fits well as a 'filler game' and especially as an educational game for our youth. They'll much rather learn their states and capitals from this game than any other way.

"1260","3377211","Education","       In the real world, I'd like to think of myself as somewhat of a movie buff.  I have a strong appreciation for many different films of all genres, and that's something that I take a lot of pride in.  The humbling factor about all of this is that I know that somewhere in this world, there are about two to ten million  other people whom are actually more qualified at calling themselves 'movie buffs' than I am.  Once in a while, a great movie will slip by my presence unnoticed; journeying from the screens of movie theaters, to the shelves of movie stores, and finally winding up in discounted DVD bins.  The movie that I 'discovered' this past weekend was director Richard Kelly's first effort 'Donnie Darko'.  I picked this up at my local FYE (For Your Entertainment) for $14.99, and I proceeded to watch it three times in a 48 hour period.  I was blown away by the content and the presentation every single time.  The last time I paid this much attention to a movie was with Sam Mendes' 'American Beauty' back in 1999,   and even though I may just be in the heat of the moment, but I think that DD is as good, IF NOT BETTER THAN American Beauty.    Donnie Darko stars Jake Gyllenhaal as the title character, and the film primarily concerns itself with one major concept: time travel.  Think of the Back to the Future trilogy as you know it, but make Marty McFly a private school teenager with a lot of angst, a tendency to sleepwalk, and emotionally disturbed.  Throw in the presence/guidance of Frank the evil bunny as the replacement for Christopher Lloyd's Doc Brown, and you've got yourself a very dark Back to the Future.    I've tried to explain this movie to my fiance and to several co-workers this morning, but I just can't find the right words that do this film justice.  It's about time travel and insanity, justice and sacrifice, and what would a movie be without the classic comic book 'save the universe' dilemma?  After watching DD for the third time last night, I went to www.donniedarko.com and completed a some questions/activities to access materials that make the movie more understanding.  I love stuff like this, where I have to build a bridge between the movie and the internet (or other resources) in order to further comprehend what's going on in the film.  If there is ever an opportunity for you to at least watch this film, do not pass it up.

"1261","3375698","Engineering","       ... is a mess.  Well, we managed to get all of my stuff bundled into a 15' truck and hauled to my new place, where it was prompty piled into a large mound.  A big thanks to T-man and Chris for helping me move all the crap I've collected over these last six years [also thanks to those who helped me move many of my small boxes of crap the night before].  Driving a large truck was new experience for me; it kinda feels like your driving a tank (but without the weaponary).  I learned that I should be a bit more courteous to U-haul truck drivers, since you really can't see anything around you when you're driving one.  When you merge you kinda just hope there isn't someone there (not that they'd pose any real danger, but the truck company charges you a premium to fix dents and to clean up blood stains).  Yesterday, my first full day in my new house, also was enlightening.  I learned where most of the vast wealth of the American people goes.  I think the reason houses have 30-year mortgages is so people don't realize they have this huge debt and are therefore quite willing to spend those years filling up their new status symbol with lots of crap from stores who specialize in this sort of thing.  Home Depot, Target, etc. are mostly filled with items that you would't need if you didn't have a house.  And you don't have much choice in the matter... sure, I could let the plants die and pave the grass so I wouldn't have to mow it [not that I would really do this] --> but then the neighborhood home-owners association would put a lien on my house and kick me out.  So much for the concept of private ownership.         ",0

"1264","3372901","Tourism","             Well disregard that previous post, cause well we pretty much well lost the house. Last night when we went over to the house we made a verbal offer and the owner was happy with it, we talked about things that we need to do within the next few days and she was happy with everything and so were we. And one of her tenants I knew, Fionna, and she kept saying 'congratulations' and so did the girl who owns it and her boyfriend. And they phoned today and asked us to come over to their place and talk. She said that the day after we looked at the house some other people did too. And last night before we went to make an offer they had phoned back and said they were interested in it too, but she told them that we were coming over to make an offer, so they showed up today and offered her exactly what she wanted, and they even showed up with a relator. So when she told us I wasn't too surprised, cause I always knew something like this might happen, and knowing my luck it would. So she said that we can match their offer and it would be ours so she told us what they offered and at first Russ and I were like 'no way!' But once we got home and calculated it, it wasn't that bad, but by then it was too late and we tried to call her back but she had already told the people we turned it down. So now the only way that we can get the house is if their financing doesn't go through, but I'm sure it will, because once again... it's just my luck that it would turn out that way, not in my favour. Nothing ever really turns out in my favour. It's quite a sad, pathetic world really. So now all I can hope is that these people are poor with bad credit and can't get their act together, but I'm sure they will and it sux that I won't know for a few more weeks now. It just gets under my skin that last night the owner was saying 'you'll love this house' 'I'm glad your excited' and to where the whole thing stands now is just upsetting to me. The owner said she felt bad, but really she'll get more money out of this, so how bad does she really feel? She's laughing to the bank and we're the joke of it. I'm just so upset and it really sux.   But on a happier note I got my digital camera in today and it's wicked! I love it so much! I'm sure I'll get bored of it soon, but for now it's fun. Well I guess I'll go sulk and get a little closer to depression. It should be fun.         ",0

No harm, no foul, as the flight to Grand Forks was all but empty.&nbsp;   So, after making a surpise visit to see Pat, he returned the favor this weekend, though it was planed.&nbsp; He was off Friday-Sunday, as he'd worked 11 days in a row, so he drove&nbsp;here Thursday night.&nbsp; He left about 3 this afternoon, all satisfied.:) Yes, I did work the last two nights, but all things considered, life is a lot better when you have someone waiting for you.&nbsp; He visited family&nbsp;last night, as i worked a long shift.&nbsp; All in all, a very nice 2+ days.&nbsp;   I think I lost some money in Vegas, but as I said, I really didn't play much poker.&nbsp; I was involved in 2 hands which were memorable.&nbsp;   In one 20/40 hand, I was the big blind, and was dealt an 8/9 suited.&nbsp; One player raised, and since everyone else folded, I stayed in, as I've been playing more 'suited connectors' and have had some luck at it.&nbsp; I was hesitant to do so, because I feel it's easy to lose to a higher flush.&nbsp; But, I still don't recall that happening.&nbsp; I am amazed how many people will ignore my signs that i have them beat, and reraise me, then turn over high pair to my straight.&nbsp; Anyway, the flush came 8/8/9.&nbsp; I checked, he bet, I raised, he reraised, and in doing so, ran out of chips.&nbsp; Thus, he was all-in, and we turned over our hands.&nbsp; He had A/A, so only an A would save him.&nbsp; On the turn came an A.&nbsp; The hand was all but over...until the 8 came on the river.&nbsp; Incredibly lucky, and I could only imagine how much I would have won had he not ran out of money.&nbsp;   The next day, I was flopped a K/K.&nbsp; I bet hard, and was called by 2.&nbsp; The flop came Kd/Qd/9s.&nbsp; Again, I bet hard, thinking I was against a flush/straight.&nbsp; The turn, 9c.&nbsp; Full house, I was unbeatable, except to a 9/9.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was maxed out by one other player.&nbsp; I was thinking straight, or possible full house,&nbsp;but under me.&nbsp; The river, 10d.&nbsp; Again, we maxed out.&nbsp; I was watching for him to turn over a pair of 9's, but instead, he had J/9...both diamonds.&nbsp; He had been betting the 3 9's, with a straight/flush draw, and had rivered a straight flush.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was so shocking it barely hurt like those bad beats always do.&nbsp;&nbsp;   My internet balance is sitting at $17932.&nbsp; Haven't played much the past few days, as I've been 'busy'.&nbsp; I think it's much easier online, as folks act like it's not real money.&nbsp; Still not nearly as much fun as the table, though it's nice not having to dress up and act seductively.&nbsp; I have started 'slow-playing' when I have a great hand, waiting a long time to call, and it seems to work every time.&nbsp; How dumb are thses people?

"1268","3372062","indUnk","             My feet still hurt.  30 hours in heels...what was I thinking?  Live and learn I guess.  I skipped my workout this AM and just went into the whirlpool.  Stayed for 45 minutes, went in the sauna for 15-20, then back into the whirlpool for 30 more.  I sweat a lot, so that should count for something.    Skipped Canterbury today as well, just didn't feel like being around men (or people in general).  I'm watching the Brewers on Direct tonight.  I overheard some folks at the athletic club today saying how hard the Woves played and what a good game it was.  Good for them.    My old botfriend called tonight.  There's a lot of history there, and I often think we'll still end up together.  We lived together for over a year back when I was still in the Milwaukee area, and dated for over 18 months.    He's just an all around good guy, works hard, lives clean, fun to be around.  He works for an electronics retailer (based up here, strangely enough) and met a fellow trainee and for whatever reason, became infatuated with her.  I met her, she was plenty cute (chesty), and quiet, somehow mesmerizing, I guess.  It was ackward, as we were living together, and one night it was over.  He had been very good to me, insisting that I live in his condo rent free, and also insisting I bank all the money I'd been paying for rent, so I had $15K just sitting around.  That was the beginning of my poker fund, actually.:)  He also gave me 45 days to move out, as he announced the 'breakup' mid-month.    I moved in with Missy, who was his former roomie actually, and who also worked as an (ahem) 'dancer'.  I often shook my head when she told me stuff, though admittedly, there was some curiousity in my head then.  Missy had made a small fortune, as she had been doing it for 5 years then, and the ex always invested it for her, wisely and safely.  I know I saw a Strong statement lying around once that said $240K...pretty good for a 23 year-old whose only talent was looking fine naked (oh, and she did).  She actually did some travelling, for conventions, and such.  Went to Mardi Gras one year to work at a establishment of some merit.  Then, a few months later, I took a job up here.  He calls once a month or so, and we've come close to getting together a few times, but we never do.  Of course, I have never told him of my moonlighting, and that simply could not continue, though it wouldn't in many relationships.  As forward thinking as many guys are, they know I get felt up (groped actually is more descriptive), and it's just tough for them.  Often, I just let it go to voice mail.  I miss him, and it's tough being serious about love and stuff after that.  He was honest with me every step of the way, and stuff happens.  They had decided not to pursue a serious relationship before I had even moved, so that hasn't hung over us at all.    The really crappy thing is that it depends on someone else.  I hate depending on someone else for my happiness.  Hate it.  Even if things are smooth and good, there's always that wandering eye and admittedly, I've behaved badly when I was younger as well.  You know, kind of dating, not exclusive, temptation hits, do you really say no because you went to a movie with Tad last Friday?    Lots of questions, and you never have all the answers, do you?             ",0
"1269","3370751","Student","            Today is actually the 7th.  But I put the entry date back to the forth because I hate you.    It was not the usual alarm clock that woke me.  Why the beep-beep-beep didn't go off at 7 o' clock sharp, I still am not sure.  Perhaps it has formed a mind of it's own; a cynical one at that.  But its 'efforts' (if a hypothetical alarm clock-mind has  efforts  at all) were in vain.    For I was awakened by pigeons.    In my room, I have two windows; one big, and one very small one.  The more larger of the two is facing south and my bed is located directly beneath it.  Now, Saturday night turned out to be quite hot, so the AC was running.  But at about 1pm, my dad turned it off and said it was because he wanted to save electricity.  Like America is in need of power saving anyway.  So I opened my window and let the cool breeze in.    'Coo-Coo-Cooooo,' was the first thing I heard Sunday morning.  But you know when you're half asleep and you don't really know what's going on?  Yeah, that was me.  I invented that feeling.  So I went back to sleep because my alarm hadn't gone off, naturally I thought it was still before 7.    It's funny how friendly little pigeons can suddenly turn you into a rampaging psycho.  They could've stopped making that noise.  They could've flew away from my window ledge.  They could've  fell  off my window ledge.  But no, they relentlessly pushed on.  And on.  And on.     Screw it, I thought.  Getting up earlier wouldn't harm anyone.  It couldn't be to far away from 7 o' clock anyway.     I checked my clock, and it read 9:15 am.  The numbers seemed more lively today; like they were taunting me.  Laughing at my folly, laughing because I wasn't going to make it.  And it was then, I felt a sense of determination and conviction; I  was  going to make it.    Wierd, it was just church.    I managed to get there in time for Sunday services.  We sang a couple of songs, and heard some prayers; particularily David Chui's ( urlLink John's  older brother).  He talked about other countries and let his heart pour out.  It made alot of people weep.  But don't get the idea that I cried.  Shut up.    After that, we had bible study (Book of John) then lunch, you know, the usual deal.  Then my dad took me to Barnes and Noble because he wanted to get this book,   urlLink Guns, Germs, and Steel , which is something his co-workers have been raving about.  He ended up also purchasing Bill Clinton's  urlLink My Life .  I doubt he's ever going to read it, though.  And lastly, he talked to me about my doing nothing productive except playing guitar and sleeping.  So, he got Michael Behe's  urlLink Darwin's Black Box  for me (a yucky science book, the biochemical challenge to evolution to be exact).    Okay, moving on.  I came home to sleep and get ready for fireworks later.  I ended playing PS2's True Crime.  At 4pm I went to Stuart's house and waited for people to come over.  Let me tell you, the worst decision you can make in your life is to enter Stuart's room...with him in there (that is, without a safety buddy to call 911).    Ben wasn't coming for another hour, so I had no choice.  We started playing a little guitar here and there, then he got bored.  So I moved to his desk chair, and let him sleep on his bed.  After awhile my stomach roared with hunger; maybe because I digest faster while being held captive.  I told him I was hungry and that we should go to Carl's to get a bite to eat.  He said, 'Okay, give me a hand up.'  I willingly obeyed.  I pulled him up on his back and started to pack my guitar.    Then he fell back down.    At least six times I had to prop him up.  On the last time I stayed behind him to hold him there.  Dammit, he's freaking heavy.  I gave up and retreated back to the much safer chair.    I never thought he would start to throw things at me.  But I'm naÃ¯ve, so my thoughts don't count.  First line of fire was his guitar case.  It wounded my eye, and one of my contacts fell out.  Suck it up, Kevin.  I took shelter behind a book shelf and returned fire.    I was hurt, but I wasn't down.  Years of training had prepared me for this and through out the battle I kept in mind what my commander once told me: 'Always expect the unexpected from Stuart.'  I let my guard down in the beginning; I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice.    Then my stupidity caught up to me.  I was right under the damned door knob!  I manuevered my way out of the door and left the battle grounds for good.  I was on his territory, he had an advantage; leaving was the only wise thing I could do.    Then his mom made fried rice for the both of us and we sat outside to eat.  The mindless chatter of the TV was on, and it set the mood of  good karma .  But this time, my guard was up, I was thinking clearly.  Somehow, I knew he was plotting against me.  Even as I was chewing down on the rice, I knew.    Rice, as it had been known to do, has a way of stealing your thoughts and transferring them to some other bowl of rice.  For today, it was my intelligence officer.  I don't think Stuart knew how to harness the powers of the grain of rice, so now, the tides have changed and I was swimming in my own bathtub again.    Oh, if Ben hadn't knocked on the door that instant, Stuart would not have lived.    Well, I've been going on and on, so I'll try summarizing.  We went to buy fireworks, lit them, and then I went home.  Stuart tied a smoke bomb at the end of my bike and told me to ride it.  Awesome.   urlLink Eric  came later with his brother and a whole bag of fireworks.    That's basically, well maybe I'm 1300 hundred words too late for  basically  but whatever, it.    It's wierd, I've been getting dÃ©jÃ  vu alot lately.  Maybe it's because of my growing up, memories tend to stack on each other, and therefore repeat.  I'm not certain.  But I'm always uneasy when it happens; you never know if Stuart might be lurking behind a corner laughing with his new creation of  dÃ©jÃ  vu zoo .           ",0

He's one of the best friends I've got, and I don't wanna lose him, but in a year's time I'm probably gonna lose all contact with him, and I don't want to, because like I said, he's one of the few people who takes me exactly as he sees me.

So, first lets recall yesterday.  Well, today (yesterday) I awoke and as i recall, spent the time browsing the [M] and chatting online until Russ invited me over.  I went over, and on the way I mentioned that my family was going to see  Spiderman 2 , and when Russ heard that he went into such a state if 'r u serios?' that we decided to go see it.  We arrived, got tickets, and got in line.  IT turns out that my mother had been held up by traffic, so they saw the 7:00 show.  Well, when all that was over Russ and I, went to his house and we watched  Yellow Submarine , for about as long as Russ could pay attention to it.  When he was thoroughly amused and done with the film, I went home.  I arrived went back on AIM, and the [M], and the remainder of the intarweb.  After which, I went to sleep.  And as for today (the actual one), I awoke, went to the intarweb and AIM for some time.  I played Starcraft for a while, and then I got bored.  I began to reminisce.  I Google Image'd for  Santa Barbara  and looked at the pics (I've included some at the bottom of this post).  So, at this point I've pretty much led myself back here.  I ask all of you out there, what place have you lived in/been to that you miss/like the most?  Feel free to include pics, just be sure to scale them down to 404 pixels wide (you can use the height and width attributes of the IMG tag to do that (to find the height use the proportions you learned in math class)).  With two days fully accounted and my questions asked, I bid you adieu.  Remember: you can post questions/comments/smart alec remarks with the comments, just be sure to leave your name.                      ",0

"1283","3361437","Technology","                   A Truely Excellent piece of work. As far as i am concerned, this is simply THE best practice for returning Data From WebServices....Read on:     There are many reasons why developers don't use the  XPathDocument  and  XPathNavigator  APIs and resort to  XmlDocument  instead. I outlined some of&nbsp;them with regards to querying functionality in&nbsp;my posts about&nbsp;   how to take advantage of XPath expression precompilation   , and    how to get an  XmlNodeList  from compiled expressions compilation   .        XPathNavigator  is a far superior way of accessing and querying data because it offers built-in support for XPath querying independently of the store, which automatically gain the feature and more importantly, because it abstracts the underlying store mechanism, which allows multiple data formats to be accessed consistently. The XML WebData team has seriously optimized the internal storage of  XPathDocument , which results in important improvents both in loading time and memory footprint, as well as general performance.&nbsp;This was possible because the underlying store is completely hidden from the developer behind the  XPathNavigator  class, therefore, even the most drastic change in internal representation does not affect current applications.      However, some useful features of the  XmlDocument  and  XmlReader  classes are not available. Basically, I've created an  XmlReader  facade over the  XPathNavigator  class, which allows you to work against either an streaming or a cursor API. I'll discuss how the missing features are enabled by the use of the new&nbsp; XPathNavigatorReader  class, part of the opensource    Mvp.Xml project   . ......

"1284","3360042","Non-Profit","           Game 2 in NBA Finals was not for the weak hearts.  Shaq was brilliant for the defence Pistons showed.  He scored 29 points with both Wallaces troubling him under the ring, but Kobe was outstanding.  He played a brilliant game, not brilliant because he scored 33 points, brilliant because he changed his scoring tactics when he found Prince is not going to let him take those jump shots.  He made some superb layups and loop shots.  And the final three point shot that took the game to overtime, wherewas Price, Hamilton was guarding Kobe.  If Kareem Rush was hero in Timberwolves match then it is Luke Walton for Pistons.  He has excellent ball control, great sense of passing and a good defence which will make Pistons to watch him in Game 3.  Great job young man.    And what on Earth were Pistons doing in the final minute when Shaq was having the ball.  They should have fouled him, instead they let him pass to Kobe.  Again, foul Kobe, let him get two points, you still lead by one.  And of course, Lakers will foul as soon as Pistons get the ball, and it would have been an entirely different ball game.  I am pretty sure Larry Brown is mad with his team for that move they made in the last minute.    Finally as a Laker fan I would like to say they played some real good defence. Go Lakers.

"1286","3359005","Student","             Ok... That title is entirely random and hysterical. But anyway, this is my comments on each individual team on the third leg of the race, with teams showing their flight arrangement skills for the first time. The first leg isn't counted cause the flight arrangements were printewd on their Route infos...  Colin & Christie -- A first place finish was entirely unearned. They were featured much more this time than in the previous episodes, and we all saw that there's really nothing much to them. They're only first because of their ability, if you can even consider it an ability, to outrun Charla. There will come a point in the race where the team will face some immense difficulty, and this team will crumble because of Chrisie's inability to keep calm and be nice. Colin is a great racer, with his ability to keep calm and his classy aggressiveness in getting his plane tickets. Christie, on the other hand, will do nothing except to bring the team down.  Charla & Mirna -- Charla & Mirna showed that they had mental powress that could overcome a lot of physical obstacles again. They are paying for it, with Charla having limited choices to make in the physical tasks. I love it that they're so aggressive but can still work well together, but they need to be nicer to the other teams. I know they're policy is to be nice to those who are nice to them, but they do not need to flare up at those who aren't. If they didn't flare up today I think they'll be in a good position to go very far, but at this point, a Yeild might be the price to pay for being mean. Boo Mirna! Charla is having a hell lot of fun in the race, except the part where she turned into a chocolate loving frankenstein after getting electrocuted. It's sad that they made an alliance with people they cannot trust... They really need to use their Yeild power now, with most effect on Marshall & Lance.  Brandon & Nicole -- Nicole first; it wasn't a smart move revealing your bond with Charla & Mirna at the airport. I fully agree with Mirna on this one. One good thing is that she has revealed herself to not be the whiny one in this race, cause Christie is the one that has gone miles ahead of her in this area. Brandon seems to be the only one in this team, taking the reins in trying to find flights, doing the tasks cause he's stronger, and according to him has a bigger stomach for chocolate. I have to give the team their props on getting to the 2nd flight, cause I really didn't see them working. Maybe it was just dumb luck. It was really despicable of this team to go leave Charla & Mirna in the lurch like that, with possibly no flight out.   Bob & Joyce -- I'm actually starting to like this team, of course under a certain influence. They've been consistent in their 4th - 5th place finishes even with their lack of physicality. They weren't featured much in this episode, but I think they can use their age more to their advantage while getting flights. Too mild to fight off the aggressive teams at the moment, but sneak under the covers and be really, really nice, and you'll get pecedence over the others when it comes to this area. Maybe the world of internet dating isn't so bad after all...  Kami & Karli -- They got really lucky with the flights this week, but it might just die on them next week. Their characters are so similar that it is impossible to tell between the 2. Didn't notice much of them this leg, except for the fact that they keep bumping into Chip & Kim everywhere. Really showed their stupidity by missing the strip of shallow water leading to the island. Coupled with them walking right past the cluebox last week, I will safely quote my friend saying, 'They use their legs more than their eyes.' Big Question: Will they be back battling for last place with Chip & Kim? Definitely yes, and they'll hopefully be joined by Marshall & Lance.  Linda & Karen -- Karen's definitely the better racer in this team. She's giving way to Linda the big chicken by letting her do the easier, more enjoyable tasks. Linda will definitely bring the team down at some point, and Karen won't be able to do anything to stop it. Unless Karen has the angel-like temperament of Zach last season, she will also not be able to take the heat and will collapse with exhaustion at having to give way to her much weaker teammate.  Chip & Kim -- Back in third to last place, and Chip declares that they're moving up, slowly but surely. Surely you realise the elimination cut off point is moving up faster than you are. Chip didn't really show any of his idiotic qualities this week, but I'm sure it'll come out next week. Hopefully we get to see whichever one, the twins or them, get to the Yeild and try and kill one another. Chip is such and idiot but doesn't use his meaness meaningfully, like in getting his tickets.  Marshall & Lance -- Marshall & Lance was the team that really deserved to go this week. I said already that I wouldn't mind, and wouldn't be surprised if these 2 went. I'm going to say that again this week... I give them their props for getting the second flight out, but that 'I'm dead' attitude at the roadblock probably would've made 10 white chocolates go down his throat without them noticing. The guy that wasn't doing to roadblock wasn't helping. Showing your frustration at you teammate is never a good idea. They are really boring, and ti sure looks like they get into trouble next week.  Jim & Marsha -- This pair definitely could've made it together. They're like the nice guy team this time aroung beside Bob & Joyce, and we would've loved to see them go further. As much as I don't want to, I have to bash them for their lack of skill in getting plane tickets. Really horrid that you managed to get tickets for someone else on the flight you weren't booked on. And in the whole race I've never, ever heard of only one team member being booked on a flight... Sad. They stayd positive till the end and there's a plus point for them.         ",0

He just attacked, nagged and blamed me why on earth I didn't finish my contract at this previous company that I used to work for. because i wasn't able to finish the 6 months probationary period, due to health reasons, i resigned from work and the company asked me to pay the twenty thousand bond. i knew that the moment i decided to resign. i'm not stupid! the heck! the job's too stressful. that's why i wanted to quit. anyway, back to that leche brother of mine, everytime he would nag and nag me about what i do with my life, i'd just lash out at him. and then he'd tell me that i didn't have any respect for him! the hell he would talk about RESPECT! he's the one who doesn't know how to respect! asshole! idiot! he's got this bloated head and an ego the size of jupiter!   he's the 2nd of child of the family. the 'special' child. he was only able to speak when he was four, he joined me in nursery when he was 6, he flunked first grade. he had a tutor all his life. he's what they call academically slow... while i was reaping off awards here and there in grade school, he had a bloody red report card. so i was the family favorite back then. but when we were older the tables have turned. now i was the black sheep of the family because of him. every mistake and every sin that i've done, he would suck up to my parents. that just pisses me off you know. every act that i made, he's so vigilant in looking for a single mistake that i do so u can tell on me to my parents. and my god, he's already 25! that's not the way to act brother. such an immature person. i don't know just how to describe his underdeveloped personality. and i just hate it too whenever my parents would always take his side! i don't know how long this hatred would last. and to think for the rest of his life, he'll be dependent on me! oh that's ok, the time will come when he would be crawling on his belly asking for forgiveness! bwahahaha.. if only he wasn't my brother, i'd abandon him for good.   cge lang... makabaws ra nya ko bah.. imo pa run francis.. imo pa run...   i'll just bide my time... i'll have my revenge soon.  i'll never forget this day. i never will. i will only forgive him on my death bed. i know my parents are not going to be here forever. the it's only going to be my eldest brother and me that he's going to turn to. if ever i don't get married, i will save up, buy my own house, i will slap my money on his face because that is the only thing that matters to him. he doesn't respect me because i don't have any money. so that's the way it's going to be. padaghanay lang diay'g kwarta? hala cge.. i'll prove it to you gyud ba..

In the old days, if you defamed someone you were summoned to the field of honor to back your accusations with a pistol or sword. A personâ€™s honor and his pledged word were thought to be sacred. If someone could not be trusted, they were consideredworthless, so it was a killing matter to defame anyone publicly.   I can think of a couple of Senators who should be called out by President Bush. Six shooters at twenty paces. People would be a little more careful about what they say publicly and the Republicans would gain a few seats in the Senate.          ",0

"1294","3353223","Technology","       I have just had a very frustrating afternoon trying to buy a notebook computer with my Partner.  My partner has started a distance learning course. She is about two thirds of the way through here first unit and the final exam is approaching. Unfortunately, she will be away on holiday when her exam starts. Being a distance learning course, the exam has been structured with distance learning in mind. All she has to do is download her exam materials one day and then submit her answers a week later. All very reasonable. Since she will be back in the UK at that time visiting relatives it makes sense to buy a notebook computer so she do her work whilst she is staying with her parents. All we need to do is buy a notebook computer for her to take with her. That doesn't sound too difficult, does it?  Well, yes it is, if the store staff manage to ignore you consistently for an hour or so.  We stayed in one of the shops for around 40 minutes looking at the notebooks that they had on offer. We tried several times to attract some interest from the staff but with no success. We went into the shop next door and had the same experience. On the way out of the second store we noted a particularly good deal on oil-filled gas heaters - it can get a bit chilly in the winter evenings here. So we went up to the counter to buy one and were completely ignored for the next 10 minutes. One of the staff even stood opposite us whilst he went through some invoices for someone else. Neither he, nor his colleague next to him, acknowledged our existence.  Do not come to New Zealand for a pleasant shopping experience. Shop staff here can be this rude on a regular basis and don't even realise that they are doing it. I must acknowledge that this was a Sunday which is a very busy shopping day. However, a polite 'I'm sorry, I'm helping another customer at the moment, I'll be with you once I finish with them' would have gone a long way in terms of customer relations. As it was, it never happened. So guess what? We will not be buying anything from either of those shops. We are certainly not buying a laptop from them, nor that really good oil-filled heater deal they had on offer.  Do you think it is a coincidence that neither of these shops had any female staff working today?  So, one of the other branches of these chains will be getting our trade. There are plenty of them around town. The respective staffs of 'Bond & Bond' and 'Noel Leemings' stores at The Palms Mall will not be seeing us again.  Pity really, because I suspect the commission on a notebook computer is a bit better than that for a standard TV or washing machine.         ",0

"1301","3348302","indUnk","             This weekend was pretty busy, but turned out to be quite fun. Friday night I went and met a friend I hadn't seen in quite some time at this gallery down in Parkdale. She was co-hosting this spoken word night with another local who was showcasing his most recent photographs. Invite only, open bar, lots of pretentious people mixed with some who were just cool as shit. I didn't get too wasted and turned down the opportunity to land face down in a snowbank. Just browsed and listened and met good people with whom I had great conversations. And... I met a boy. He is a friend of the photographer and is really hot, intelligent, artistic, sarcastic, witty, and fun. He isn't much of a drinker and doesn't really do any drugs besides smoke weed - what a rare and refreshing change that is, well compared to the people I know and usually meet anyways. No cheesy come-ons, just talking and connecting. I haven't connected with someone in too long, it was nice. He was really sweet and flattering and made me feel good (unlike so many in my life). There are just those people you meet that you can look at and know that they are possible relationship material, good quality they are. I call them A-List people. Then there are those who are good for nothing more than a night or act only as fillers, a distraction in between the good ones: B-List people. He appears to be of the A-List variety. I have just recently cut all strings with a B-List person which feels damn good - distraction no longer required. This is potentially the perfect time for an A-List to come into my life. I'll have to get to know him better though before I can come to any conclusions on the matter.  Saturday night was a friend's birthday so we all went out to Mod Club for the brit pop/retro night. Such a good club. I pretty much always have a great time when I go there. Again... I refrained from shoveling anything up my nose - and drinks were in moderation. No sloppy messes to clean up or random pieces to try to put back together. Just fun and dancing and laughing with good people. I was home and in bed by 3am. This gave me quite a bit of satisfaction.  Yesterday we had a few people over at our house for drinks and a bbq. The weather was gorgeous. I got a bit too drunk and woke up in the middle of the night still dressed, half on the couch and half falling off. I don't remember how I got there or events leading up to my passing out. Oh well, one night out of three isn't bad. And I'm not feeling too hungover today. As simple and basic as this might be, I realize I like waking up at a somewhat reasonable hour and not feeling like absolute shit. Wow, what a revelation... I must deserve some kind of reward for that one. ;)  I feel good about myself and my decisions this weekend. I feel good that I met cool new people who may end up playing a prominent role in my life in the future. I feel good about baggage that I no longer am carrying the weight of. I feel good about having taken a deep breath and deciding to let go of many things that have been weighing me down and people that have been hurting me and taking me for granted. I'm grasping desperately now for a way to have a fresh start and a fresh outlook without having to skip the country - this weekend, on several levels, has given me a shred of hope that this may be possible. I'm not speaking of quitting drugs or drinking completely, it's not just about substances, it's about perspective. Now I'm just afraid that I'll slip and fall again like I have too often in the past.  I'm feelin' alright...          ",0

I have been studying for my initial certificate test. I take the test on this coming up Saturday the 12th. I have been studying when i ever get a break at work or on my lunch hour. Since i started working at Wallyworld I have been dreaming about Scanning items in my sleep. lol Once i tried to scan Sammy(our dog). lol  Then i realized that i was trying to put him into my dream. I have been on a register since last Tuesday i guess it was. I think I have been getting better on coordinating the scanning and bagging. I have fun talking to the customers and seeing all the little ones that come around.  One lady that came through the line had 3 kids under 5. She looked really stressed out. I tried to encourage her and let her know that it DOES get better as they get older. lol  Not much else has been going on besides work. I will be glad when i have taken my test and it is behind me!                 ",0

"1308","3343042","indUnk","       I've been searching for a job these past few months, after finally accepting the fact that I cannot work with my husband AND be married to him. After being employed steadily for ten years, it's very difficult to get out and start interviewing. I worry that I'm too old for the job market - God, when did I start considering myself too old for things? I worry that I'm overweight and will make a bad impression, as of someone who will spend afternoons grazing in the staff room refrigerator instead of writing up crucial reports. I worry that I've lost my polish, having been 'gone so long.'  I have found a position that is perfect for me. It incorporates all of my skills from past and present, and offers enormous growth potential. It's also with a prestigious institutions, and I know that, quite frankly, I could be 'set for life' if chosen for the job. My chest ached when I took a test drive by the building and  gazed up at the windows, projecting myself into the future. There I would be, draped in fine linen from J. Jill or Chico's, slightly funky but always the respected professional. And there would be my cherished Christmas Cactus by the window, and my books piled around it. I would be in a meeting, and I could see myself through that window, laughing and gesturing graciously, enjoying the process, the moment.   When I received notice that I had actually been chosen for an interview, my knees went weak. My opportunity at last. I prepared for several days, putting my 'book' together and reviewed some technical skills referred to in the position description. I researched the company and gained an understanding of its mission and goals. I was ready.   But when I walked into the interview yesterday, everything changed. The group was much different from what I had expected -- three perfectly polite but rather aloof interviewers. No offer of a glass of water. Nobody seemed to have a copy of my resume on top of their stack of papers, or a list of questions. They started the questioning away, no small talk. No humor or attempt to make me comfortable whatsoever. And novice questions, too, such as 'What's your greatest weakness?'   'Oh, God,' I remember thinking.   Like a tidal wave, I was hit by a wall of fear. I could feel my breathing become shallow, could feel my cheeks burning, could hear the awful noise of my tongue clapping against the inside of my dry mouth. I knew I must be making an impression similar to that of a beached cod.  I was flooded with embarrassment, and I couldn't stop talking. I talked and talked, and although I responded to their questions as best I could, I had difficulty hearing throught the pounding in my ears, and I knew I wasn't giving my Sunday-best answers.   I realize only now what it was that frightened me so terribly. I had understood then, consciously, that I was no longer a person who saw the world as full of possibility. That somewhere along the way I had become a person who understood that things in life are finite, and that opportunities are limited and must be snatched at all costs before they disappear. I was a foreigner to myself at that moment, much as an old woman with a young mind is foreign to her own papery, blue-veined mirror image. And in that moment of foreigness and fright -- not of the present but of the future -- I lost my bearings. Lost my way, and my confidence with it.  So now I wait. Wait to see if I've made the second round. The cut. I am terrifed. I am defiant. I challenge them to NOT want me. Their loss. I will cry if offered the job, I know it. I want it, I want them. I hate them for not bringing my resume and a set of thoughtful questions to the interview. I envy them the positions they already hold. I am full of feelings and thoughts that chase each other around in my head.   I will wait and think, one minute confident and the next devastated. This is what it is to feel, for the first time in my life, the heavy weight of desperation.         ",0

"1312","3339644","Internet","       The first time i saw her i thought she is preety, but so are almost all the girls around the globe. We didnt talk to each other for a long time, i was afraid that i will start liking her and a romantic relationship is the last thing i would want to do at office. But i always admired her, she was beautiful, simple, elegant. She is the most soft-spoken girl that i have ever seen and has those big eyes that poets talk about.  And then i thought what is the harm in having a simple friendship, i was decieving myself. Things were great those days, we used to chat so much, we used to meet up for coffee and would just chat and chat. It was like a dream - a beautiful one. Somewhere in the middle of those innocent chats she make her way into my mind. And then soemthing happened, something that has never happened to me before, something that was totally alien to me. I would think about her all the time just remembering what she said, how she looked at me, how she laughed. I would run to my cell phone as soon as it beeps thinking that probably its her and for the first time in my life i felt what it was to be in love.  The more i thought about her the more i realized that she is *thee one* for me.  I started giving her subtle hints about how i feel and was on top of the world when she didnt tried to stop me or push me away.

On Thursday I met up with him and wing night and stupid Mitch wanted to leave, so I ended up going home, but yesterday we went downtown and I hung out with him all afternoon &amp; saw 'The Village'.

My dad's tiny fuse was lit this morning and I'm grounded for a week, but I wanna sneak out. Because last night Adam said I was amazing, and that he wasn't sure, but he's definitely interested in something with me. I was so happy, so if I want to see him at all this week, I'll have to sneak out. It's kinda weird liking Adam, because I worked so hard to free myself for Wes.

"1323","3334323","indUnk","       It looks like it is going to be another beautiful day. The sun is already warm and determined. I slept with the curtains drawn back, not wanting to trap what little cool air there was from the open window. I listened to the traffic slow to an occasional passing car as the night grew old and then to the chirriping of birds as a new day took its place. My bed became a pool of dancing light as the sun began to fill the room. I felt as though I were bathing in sunbeams as it reached out to warm my skin. I smiled.  I love my bedroom, or rather my bed. The room itself still needs much to be done to make it the retreat I envisage. When I moved here, a year ago last May, I needed to buy a new bed. On an impulse, I made a bid on a second hand four poster on ebay. The fates must have been smiling on me that day, it did not reach its reserve and I was the highest bidder. My ex-husband's mouth squeezed into that disapproving line he does so well as he told me I was irresponsible and mad to make such a purchase.  Maybe he was right. Common sense had nothing to do with fulfilling a small dream held since childhood. My very own four poster bed. A modern reproduction that masquerades as brass it may be, but still it is beautiful. I clothed it with red and black satin. Piled cushions in red and gold by the pillows. Threw a heavy, black and gold, medieval design cover along its length. Rosebud, a doll once owned by my mother, holds court there during the daytime.   At night it is my haven. The place where I read and write and sketch. Gradually filling as the week goes on, with books and paper, pencils and pens. Until Pru complains that there is not enough space to stretch out and purr.   This morning I swam there in sunlight and day dreams and knew that sometimes 'sensible' is not the right choice.         ",0
"1324","3334256","Publishing","           Mehmet Okur is going to be playing for the Utah Jazz next season. The Jazz offered Memo a 6 year 50 million dollar contract. That is a lot of money for someone who could not get off the Piston's bench in the postseason. Maybe, just maybe, the Pistons had a lot more talent than people were saying during last season.   Mehmet is a restricted free agent, but there is no chance of the Pistons matching this deal. We offered Memo about ten million dollars less money. The early word on Memo's possible replacement is Antonio McDyess. I am not sure what I think about that, but he used to be very good. He will not have to do much on the Pistons squad. I believe it would be a good fit for McDyess, but not sure it helps the Pistons team all that much.   Early word is that the initial meeting with Rasheed went well. I will not stop being extremly nervous however until I hear Rasheed accepts our offer. The god damn Knicks possibility really scares me. PLEASE STAY SHEED. PLEASE.

"1325","3333514","Publishing","           Kids and I went to the Summer kick-off event at the Roseville Library today. Lots of fun - but when isn't it fun to eat hot dogs, popcorn, ice-cream, and lemonade at  10:45 AM  while sitting on a curb in a parking lot! Dad steered clear of the hot-dogs - I usually stay away from beef by-products until after noon.   Signed up for the summer reading program, prizes after reaching 8 and 20 hours of reading (or being read to in Bone's case). Much fun inside the library as we watched the show of 'Bruce the Bug Guy'. The guy really knows how to work an audience. The best part was when he puts three bugs each in a series of tupperware containers and places them on the floor for a little audience participation. Everyone just stared as we sat gathered around our creepy dish. All the kids claimed they wanted to touch the bugs but didn't actually dare to take their hands out of their laps. The two moms in my circle were supportive, but offered no help. (One actually kept quite a brave face as it looked like she might faint at any minute.) As you may have guessed, your hero, stepped forward and picked up the  urlLink giant millipede . This little lovely was dark brown, measured about 6 inches long, and was about 1 inch in circumfrince. With 248 legs (according to Bruce)it looked like a cigar come to life. It tickled as it worked its way up my hand to my wrist, then my arm. Doddy wanted to try, so I gently pulled the critter off - the legs gently popping off my skin - he really had a grip! The Dude did a pretty good job and seemed to enjoy himself. Eventually the other kids warmed to the occasion and 'petted' the little monster.  Having mastered the millipede, I just had to try the  urlLink 'Hissing Cockroach'  - so named because when alarmed it hisses - I kid you not. Of course if lived up to its name when I lifted him from the dish, hissing at me and the kids as if on cue. Very cool! This guy was a little creepy, about 4 inches long! No one really like this guy.   A few minutes after the bug show I made the mistake of licking my finger tip to turn a page (it's a library after all). I wish I could say it tasted like chicken. It didn't - very bitter - very bitter.          ",0

"1330","3328531","Student","       Why are we so amused by ignorance? Why do we constantly tune in to laugh at ComicView and the myriad of other stupid ass shows that come on TV? To make matters worse, instead of being able to acknowledge this lack of intelligence, we defend it and simply brush the issue off by saying, 'It's just entertainment!'. Havven't we gotten fed up with simply being entertainers? Why don't we start to function in other facets of society? I guess that all of this is starting to come to mind afetr experiencing the aimless bickering of some black students today. They were arguing over 'gear' and who had the most! The conversation was stupid, so instead of butting in and correcting the idiots, i decided to stay on the outside and adopt a new sense of simply observing life. the conversation translates as follows:  PERSON A: I have a lot more cheaply made cotton than you because my parent (note the absence of the plural form of parent and the absense of Person A's job being mentioned)has more money than you parent!  PERSON B: What do you mean? My mother has lot's of money that she gives to me to buy clothes with. i never elect to spen the money on more valuable purposes liek college application fees or books taht have intellectual value. Instead, I enjoy pouring my money out of the community into the hands of the same group of people that my ancestors picked these fabrics for!  PERSON A: Be quiet, your arguement is starting to sound almost as good as mine so now I feel the need to call you a name in a latent act of psychological projection. I feel depressed and sad with my inner self as well as my surroundings (family, neighborhood, etc), so I am going to lash out on you by calling you a homosexual!     im bored now, sleep awaits me, sorry!

"1334","3323299","Sports-Recreation","       Okay okay, sorry folks again the 'wedding vacation' took alot out of me, but I will be back now writing regularly for about 2 weeks, then another week long furlow.  Today we shall talk about Mr. Phil Jackson, as Jeff Van Gundy once referred to him 'Big Chief Triangle.'  Now is the time were Mr. Jackson can make his mark on the game of basketball.  He has been on cruise control as an NBA head coach for over ten years.  Every year he has not won the championship people have had ready made excuses for him, Jordan was retired or Jordan just came back, when the Lakers didn't win it was because Shaq never got in shape.....yada yada yada.  Now he has no excuses, he has 4 hall of famers everyone is in shape and Kobe had maybe his best season ever, even while having to deal with the problems in his personal life.    He actual has to be a coach now, he cannot just sit around and do nothing and pass out books and hope everyone plays well.  He has 4 hall of famers, and he is supposed to be the man who can manage talent better than anyone else, so lets see you get at Big Chief.  It is time to put himself up there with the greats, because for me his titles alone don't do it.  He is going up against a hall of fame coach right now who has prepared his team very well.  The Pistons have a solid defensive game plan with helping on Kobe when he goes to the middle and not really doubling Shaq and completely shutting down Devean George, Derek Fisher and others.  Offensiveley they are playing various line-ups and explotiing every mismatch and what has Jackosn done to thwart any of this??  Oh yeah,  NOTHING .  They got lucky in game 2, for some reason Rasheed fouled Shaq & he hit a free throw, and then Kobe hit a huge shot.  Otherwise they have been outplayed and outcoached since the opening tip.    I sent out the same challenge to the Big Chief in the Spurs series and he responded by having a better gameplan to contain Ginobili and Parker.  Well here it is again Mr. Jackson, if you don't earn your stripes now I am afraid you are not an all time great.  Every human on the planet pikced you to win in 5-6 games and you are down 2-1.  Your team is openly questioning what their defensive gameplan is, so Philly Boy lets see what you got.          ",0
"1335","3323299","Sports-Recreation","         NOTE:  This is for the true baseball geek only.        On this the second day of August 2004 we remember the life  and times of the great Thurman Munson.  He was a Yankee, a Captain, a teammate and by all accounts a great person.  So the question still remains why is he not in The Baseball Hall of Fame?  There is plenty of precident here, Roberto Clemente was enshrined immediately after his tragic death, Sandy Koufax was a first ballot hall of famer for a body of work that consisted of 5 great years, and countless number of Negro League players were inducted for feats they may or may not have acheived.  Munson career was tragically cut short, I do not think you can hold that against him.  The only thin you can do is examine his body of work as it exists and compare it to his contemperaries. Me being the baseball freak, I have done the research for you and will now present it to you.  Thurman Munson played 11 seasons and made 7 All-Star appearences. He was the 1970 Rookie of the Year, 1976 AL MVP, and 3 Time Gold Glove winner.  He batted .292 for his career, had 3 100 RBI Seasons, and 5 seasons were he batted over .300.  Those are some very good numbers, he was always amongst the best players in the league, and he was known as the best clutch hitter in the game.  That was most evident in the post season, where he batted .357 slugged .497 and had 22 RBI in just 30 games.  Here is a list of people who played alongside Munson wh are all in the Hall of Fam:  Carlton Fisk, Tony Perez, Reggie Jackson, Rod Carew, Joe Morgan, Johnny Bench, Carl Yastremski, Willie Stargell, Billy Williams and Willie McCovey.  Now some of these guys can be excluded from the argument because they have the magic numbers to get in the Hall, such as: Jackson (500 HR), Carew (3,000 Hits), Yaz (3,000),  and McCovey (500).  So now lets look at the rest of these guys.  Fisk....   .269 BA/3 .300 plus seasons/ 2 100 RBI Seasons/11 All Star games   Perez...  .279 BA/2 .300 plus seasons/.238 BA & 25 RBI in 47 post season games   Morgan .271 BA/2 .300 plus seasons/ .182 post season BA   Bench... .267 BA/1 .300 plus season/ 154 hits per 162(Munson 177)/ .266 20 RBI in 45 post season games   Stargell .282/5 100 RBI seasons/3 .300 plus seasons/ 7 All Star games/ .266 20 RBI in 36 post season games   Williams .290/3 100 RBI seasons/5 .300 plus seasons/6 All Star games  I will leave the rest up to you.

"1339","3321750","indUnk","                 Every now and then I want to do something out of character. I get tired of the whole â€œLittle Miss Goody Two Shoesâ€ crap. Did you know if youâ€™re a â€œgood girlâ€ people donâ€™t invite you as many places or tell you as many jokes? Did you know if youâ€™re a â€œgood girlâ€ people dismiss you as naÃ¯ve and make excuses for you? Did you know if youâ€™re a â€œgood girlâ€ some people will consider you arrogant, holier than thou and dislike you simply because you donâ€™t drink or smoke or swear or whatever it is they enjoy? I think thatâ€™s why I sometimes have a burning desire to be â€œbadâ€.  When I was in college, I had several friends who liked to party. One day some friends and I were talking about our plans for the evening.  I had nothing planned; they were going to another friendâ€™s to watch movies. I wasnâ€™t invited because â€œOh well weâ€™re going to be drinking and stuff.â€ I donâ€™t drink but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m perched on a pedestal looking down my nose at those who do. I canâ€™t tell you how many times Iâ€™ve heard some variation of â€œweâ€™re drinking so you arenâ€™t invited.â€ When did â€œI donâ€™t drinkâ€ turn in to â€œIâ€™m no fun?â€  People tell my husband jokes that leave him gasping for air and holding his sides. When I tell them I want to hear the joke they give me a funny look and say, â€œOh you wouldnâ€™t like it.â€  I am not easily offended but most people seem to think I am. Itâ€™s refreshing to talk to someone who doesnâ€™t weigh every word. The other day I chatted with a guy who had some unpleasant things to say about my home state. Actually the basic theme was he hates North Carolina. He lived here for a while and was miserable. Nothing he said offended me. It was interesting to get another perspective on a place I call home from someone who has actually spent time here. Iâ€™ve had people apologize to me for the smallest sexual innuendo in a conversation. Why do people seem to walk a line with me? Iâ€™m not a saint or an angel and it bothers me to think I make people uncomfortable on some level.  Itâ€™s disconcerting when my husbandâ€™s friends stop talking or change the subject when I take my headphones off or walk in the room. Hey guys, I heard you through the headphones or from the other room and I wasnâ€™t shocked by anything you said. I can leave a room of people speechless if I say â€œdamnâ€ or â€œhellâ€ because I donâ€™t usually swear but that doesnâ€™t mean hearing other people use those words bothers me. What bothers me is hearing â€œsheâ€™s having a bad dayâ€ or some other explanation when I do swear.   The biggest problem with wanting to be â€œbadâ€ is I never do it. I canâ€™t even play a prank on somebody without worrying about how theyâ€™re going to feel. My husband plays pranks on me but I have never retaliated.  I could put powdered sugar in his creamer canister. No thatâ€™s too mean. What about . . ?  No. Maybe . . ?  No.   I have the same problem when Iâ€™m trying to figure out what to do to show people Iâ€™m not the saint they think I am. I donâ€™t like the Little Miss Goody Two Shoes label but I canâ€™t think of one thing I want to change that would make me seem more â€œnormalâ€ so I guess Iâ€™m stuck with it. Since when is being good something to be ashamed of? Why do I feel the need to defend my choices?          ",0

Well, I saw that he looked a little lighter in color than usual and that he had a new pincher claw!  I think he pulled a fast own on me and molted by surprise.  I figured it had to happen pretty fast if he was to regain his new claw.  Also, I have been giving him more Ocean Water so that it would help with the nourishment in growing his new claw.  I had heard that if you give them more ocean water, they tend to grow back their limbs faster, but I did not expect him to grow it back in 2 months!  Crazy, but good for him.  As soon as his normal color returns, I'll introduce him to the others.

"1349","3311967","Internet","       Teacher caught me.  I was masturbating in the cloakroom of Teacher's office.  I thought I would be alone.  Well, except that I was thinking about Teacher, and I wasn't surprised when he opened the door and saw me... leaning against the back wall, my skirt up around my waist, one hand in my panties and the other pinching my nipples through my starched white shirt.  'Miss Drake!  What do you think you're doing?' Teacher asked in a calm tone.  I could hear the steel beneath it.  'I... err... I was just...'  I tried to put myself together.    'Come here, Miss Drake.  Just as you are,' he commanded.  'Don't bother trying to straighten your clothes.  The other students know what a slut you are.'  I obeyed.  My skirt was askew and one shirt-tail was hanging out.  Worse, I hadn't yet reached orgasm when I was interrupted.  I stole a glance down as I emerged from the closet.  I couldn't help smiling when I saw the bulge in Teacher's slacks.  Of course, he saw the smile, and I knew I would pay for it.  He marched me back to the class that I had skipped when I discovered Teacher's office was unlocked.  Teacher was right.  The students did know what a slut I was.  Especially the boys.  The whispering started as soon as I entered.  'Over the desk, Miss Drake.'  Teacher's desk was always clean.  I obeyed, assuming the position I knew all too well.  But this was the first time I was to be punished in front of the class.  Teacher flipped my skirt up.  I couldn't help it.  I jumped.  I had expected the first stroke to fall, and instead had felt the crisp hairs on the back of his hand brush against my thighs.  'Do I need to make you hold still, Miss Drake?' Teacher asked.  He didn't wait for an answer.  'Andrew, Bryan, come here and hold Miss Drake in place.'  I heard the class breaking out again in whispers and felt a firm grip on each ankle as the boys grabbed my legs and spread and lifted them, so that my feet no longer touched the floor.  From their position sitting on the floor, they could see everything.  Could smell everything.  Had my panties soaked through yet?  'Miss Drake is a dirty slut and needs to be punished,' Teacher announced to the class.  'Bryan, take her panties down.'  I felt Bryan's hot breath on me as he peeled my panties down to around my knees.  He pulled my leg closer to him, and I realized he was surreptitiously rubbing his hard cock against my calf.  A whimper escaped me.  'Count the strokes, Miss Drake,' Teacher ordered.  Then the first stroke of the thick wooden ruler fell on my left buttock.  'One, Sir,' I gasped.  'You are a very naughty girl, and you need to be punished,' Teacher said, then swung again.  'Two, Sir.'  'You need to be punished in front of the whole class to teach you not to be such a dirty slut.'  'Three, Sir.'  'And I will punish you, every day, if I have to.'  And so it went, me counting each stroke and Teacher telling me and the class what a naughty girl I was.  My bottom grew hot and I struggled to remember the count while trying very hard to catch a view of the bulge in Teacher's slacks.   Please make me stay after school,  I begged silently.   Please, Teacher.  I'll be such a good naughty girl if you do.          ",0
"1350","3310540","indUnk","       Last night we saw 'Touching the Void.'  As expected, it was a fascinating film.   Apart from anything else, I love seeing the mountains and vivid colours of the scenery.  Clear blue, white and black.  (It has been clear blue skies here in Auckland for the past few days - beautiful.)   I love to read and hear about mountaineering and exploring, and especially stories of adversity.  As in 'Touching the Void,' the storytellers are nearly always articulate, philosophical and flawed characters.  Forced to face their mortality, their insights and the way they express them are so interesting.    Joe Simpson seems like a classic example.  His experience was so horrific and yet there is no way it can be portrayed as heroic or, according to him, as the central event in his life.   What's really amazing for me is the incredible resilience of the human body, and how the body and mind work together to force survival.  Trying to relate this to events in my own life in the past few days, there isn't much comparison.

We met Sandra six months ago as a enthusiastic amateur and we made it our mission in life to get her into a band and train her in the art of playing live, never suspecting it would be our band.

I started playing Rod Stewarts 'I don't wanna'. It's a good job Im playing a 12 string it's worth two guitars in sound. She fell apart.

(Yes, Ash, we hung the fishies today! You'll love them! And yes, they were tripped over... several times. Oops...)  Nothing else to say. Bored as all get out, but that's the way it is for most of us, I'd say. OH! How could I forget the fact that I broke an Ayu CD while trying to get over my parents' crap in the garage? I may be thin, but there are some instances when squeezing over - and not through - is the best way out, even if it means having to import another CD. :(  'Get up off your knees! You're too young for that...'          ",0

"1357","3300413","indUnk","                 I should have been born a cat, for all my familial instincts..  But still this doesn't answer the reason why I am always at the receiving end of the wrath which erupts like a volcano once I tell a close buddy 'NO I wont give a farewell party'. Most of the time the reciever takes it in the offensive. With the look of an wounded tiger he would revert, 'Who asked u to pay the tab?'.  But buddy, thing is that I hate being in a farewell party . I just hate it!! Just like one hates attending a party on somebodies amputed leg-especially if it is your own-.    My hatred for farewell parties began long back. When my seniors in the boarding house was about to complete their 10th we decided to give them a party. We decided to stroll down to a nearby beach side fort for the occassion.Inside the fort we sat down in an arc basked by the golden rays of sun.    I was in my usual attire. Half shorts, un-ironed shirt and an unkempt hair. When the role of the comperer for the show was thrusted upon me as usual, I slipped on to it like a duck into water.   Like an old pro I strolled in. But.. Some thing suddenly struck me. I started pouring all over with the frenzy of a flood with manic road rage, which just ripped open a Hirakud. I sobbed unconsolably, while the others around gathered around and consoled me. That was the best compering I have ever done. People around thought the show was a big success after my torrential downpour!!! Every one else were happy and content expect me.   I felt like a sissy.. With the sadness of somebody who lost his manhood, which he patiently groomed for a decade and a half, I decided farewells are not mine..               ",0

It's been crazy here.  Very busy, but it's been good.  Very, very good that the Pistons now have a 3-1 lead on the Lakers and will most likely put an end to the Lakers misery on Tuesday night.  I watched last night as the Lakers seemed obsessed with complainging to the referees, and I have heard interviews with several of the Lakers team, including Shaq, Phil Jackson, Kobe, and others and it seems that the farther they get behind in the series, the more the finger pointing elevates.  'So and so won't get me the ball enough,'  'If I were to get more shots, but so and so is so selfish,'  'The officiating has not been what it should be.'  These are grown men who are unwilling to take responsibility for the loss in a game.  We see children do it all of the time, but these men ought to be able to stand up under the pressure and scrutiny of the spotlight and take the blame themselves. It's been that way from the beginning, though, and sometimes it takes an entertaining basketball game for me to look at myself and see how often I point the finger at someone else intstead of confessing and moving on.  Adam and Eve started it in Genesis and we've been pointing fingers ever since.

"1369","3241908","Advertising","        Recommended Reading for Every Mood, Moment, and Reason    'When I get a little money, I buy books. And if there is any left over, I buy food.'  â€” Desiderius Erasmus  This pretty much sums up my approach to books. I love them with a passion. I can't wait to read good ones I've heard about. So I was interested to take a look at  urlLink Book Lust . Librarian Nancy Pearl has turned a lifetime love of books into lists of recommendations in over 175 categories. There is something for everyone: Dinosaur Hunting, Academia: The Joke, Road Novels, Kitchen-Sink Poetry. Each of her suggestions is accompanied by a few of her thoughts on it and a succinct plot summary. She also has highlighted a few authors that are relatively unknown and 'Too Good to Miss'. I was pleased to see two of my favorite 'unknown' authors, Connie Willis and Ross Thomas, were included.  I usually don't wind up with many recommendations from this sort of book because I'm a fairly low brow reader, sticking to mysteries, science fiction, and memoirs ... and none of them had better be too sad or serious. I was surprised to find myself with a list of over 60 books to try. Eventually, I'd put the book down to do something and when I came back it had disappeared. Hannah now has a large list of books to try also. Thank heavens for the public library!         ",0

Shame on the other President and the other thirty or so members.  In the news, the three of us Exun appointees have to go for the March Past just like the rest of them appointees. I wouldn't really mind doing it, because it's not really something that involves a lot of physical exertion or anything, however, it does require me to miss classes, something that I'm vehemently against. Fortunately, the Investiture Ceremony is now in August (assumably on the day of the Independence Day assembly). We did get our badges. I'll probably scan them or take a photo of them and post it on either this log or my blog. They had the option of choosing from a Rs. 20 and a Rs. 25 badge, they however, went for the Rs. 5 badge or so I like to call it.

"1373","3228857","indUnk","       Rule 1: If u pull up in the driveway and honk you'd better be delivering a package cause u sure aren't picking anything up. Rule 2: You do not touch my daughter in my presence. You may glance at her as long as your gaze doesnt travel below her neck! If you cannot keep ur hands or eyes off my daughter  i will gladly remove them. Rule 3: i am aware that it is fashionable to wear your trousers so loosely they appear to be falling off of your hips. Please dont take this as an insult, but u and all ur friends are idiots. Still i want to be fair and keep an open mind about this issue, so i propose a compromise: you may come to the door with your underwear hanging out and your pants 10 sizes to big, and i will not object. However, in order to insure that your clothes do not in fact come off during the course of the date with my daughter. I will take my electric nail gun and fasten your trousers securely in place at your waist. Rule 4: I'm sure you've been told that in today's society, sex without  utilizing a 'Barrier Method' can kill you. Let me elaborate...when it comes to my daughter and sex i am the barrier and i will kill u.  Rule 5: It is usually understood that in order for us to get to know each other, we should talk about sports or politics or other issues of the day. Please do not do this. The only information i require from you is an indication of what time u will have my daughter safely back at home, and the only word i need to here is 'early'. Rule 6: I have no doubt that u are a very popular fellow, with many opportunities to date other girls. This is fine with me as long as it is okay with my daughter. Otherwise, once you have gone out wiht my little girl you will continue to date no one but her until she is finished with u. If u make her cry i will make u cry. Rule 7: As u stand in my home, waiting fo rmy daughter to appear, and more than an hour goes by, do not sigh and fidget. If you want to be on time for the movie you should not be dating. My daughter is putting on her makeup, a process that can take longer than painting the Golden Gate Bridge. Instead of just standing there, why dont u make urself useful by, ohh changing the oil in my car?  Rule 8: The following places are not appropriate for a date with my daughter: Places where there are beds, sofas, or anything softer than a wooden stool. Places where there is darkness. Places where there is dancing, holding hands, or happiness. Places where the ambient temperature is warm enough to induce my daughter into wearing shorts, tanktops, midriff T's, or anything other than overalls, a sweater, and a goose down parka zipped all of the way up. Movies with a strong romantic or sexual theme are to be avoided; movies which feature chainsaws are ok. Hockey games are ok. Old folks homes are better. Rule 9: Do not lie to me. I appear to be a potbelied, balding, middle-aged, dimwitted has-been. But on issues concerning my daughter, I am the all-knowing, merciless God of your universe. If i ask you where you are going and with whom, you have one chance to tell me the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. I have a shotgun, a shove, and 5 acres behind the house do not trifle with me. Rule 10: Be afraid, be very afraid. It takes very little for me to mistake the sound of your car in the driveway for a chopper coming in over a rice paddy near Hanoi. When my Agent Orange starts acting up, the voices in my head frequentl tell me to clean my guns as i wait for you to bring my daughter home. As soon as you pull in the driveway you whould exit the car with both hands in plain sight. Speak the perimeter password, announce in a clear voice that you have brought my daughter home safely and early, then return to your car-there is no need for you to come inside. The camouflaged face you see in the windo is mine.         ",0

Add the thinly sliced green onions to the sauce, and serve the pork chops covered with the sauce.  Can be served with any boiled/steamed vegetable, fx. Potatoes or asparagus.  The whole thing shouldn't take more than 20 minutes.  I prepared the dish last night, and the sweet'n'sour sauce really went very well with the pork chops - it is definitely not the last time I make this.. ;)             ",0

"1390","3211137","indUnk","       Can't we all just get along? Well, I broke up with Claire today.  The break-up doesn't bother me too much; I saw it coming a long time ago, and I did, after all, break it off.  What gets me is her reaction.  I was putting it off because of my fear that she'd be angry or sad, but what she did was much worse.  She smiled, said ok, and was completely unbothered by it.  In fact she almost seemed relieved.  It doesn't do much for my ego, and it confirms my belief that the whole relationship was meaningless.  What a waste of a chunk of my life.  Well, at least people like Kiel can't say I've never had a girlfriend (or for that matter never been to State).  I hope we beat LC just so I can rub it in his face.  That would be rich.  No time for Mtto5 today, too close to last time.  Consider the first line of my post my message to everyone. To Thomas's I add: I was kinda kidding, but whatever.

We are currently trying to buy a home, and we have had two houses sold out from under us.  We have a bid in on a third house now and hope to hear back about it sometime tomorrow.  Pray that this one works out!  On top of the house buying, I have also been working overtime at work and teaching and preaching at church.  With all of this put together, I have had NO time, and I am not even going to mention how dirty our home is since we haven't had time to clean, mow, etc!!

Starting with a trip to the spa for Ashley, so she can be smelling fine and all clean to meet little itchy brother.Then will be off with Rob for the breakfast celebration of the Grand Day of the Puppy --- waffles, for sure. And off to Chino to meet our 3rd dog and bring him home. We may take turns driving home so that Rob and Glen can hold him, and not just me the WHOLE way home. I'm sure Glen will explain to him about the Tour de France on the way home. Maybe we'll really name him Musette. Is that too girly?  I hope I'll be able to sleep tonight. Can we do it? Can we raise a social, well-behaved lab? Upon relfection, I'd have to say we kinda spoiled our M.C. (Magnificent Creature, a.k.a. Samson #1). I've been studying how to housebreak a pup --- quite a diverse topic come to find out.   I just can't wait to see which one we will bring home. And how little will he be at 6.5 weeks? We couldn't even pick out a collar yet because we aren't sure what size his neck is. We only bought him three toys. A rope (pup-size), and 'puppy starter kit' of Nylabones, and a miniature tennis ball. We don't want to over indulge him. :-) The book said...one chew toy and one play toy. We must say we were slightly manipulated by the marketers...if the packaging says 'puppy', maybe we need one. But we used great restraint.  We will be all consumed with cute, so please be patient with us. We are warmed up to that condition thanks to the arrival of Miss Brianna. She has taught us how to appreciate cute and find more love in our hearts.  I'm lunching with Doris and Audrey today. Audrey's on Spring Break, so out we go for some girl talk and crepes.  Great to see the photos of New Orleans! Good for Steve & Beth for taking time to get-away and play as a couple. High priority. I have favorite parts...Preservation Hall Jazz Band, coffee and beignets at Cafe du Monde, and the food! And definitely people watching. Glad you had a great time.  And I'll be watching the OLN on Thursdays now. I'll check for a musette at Crate & Barrel (Steve, that made me smile). I think it is really a sweet young woman, but Glen must not know that. OK, probably not.         ",0

"1398","320176","Publishing","             I watched 'The Word in the World' with Father Michael Manning yesterday as he interviewed a missionary. I came rather late in the discussion and I have no idea if the missionary was a priest or a lay religious--he wore no habit or clerical atire and he was never identified by any title by Father Manning. But what struck me was the missionary's total reduction of the Gospel to a political platform for the restructuring of society. Asked point blank what the message of Jesus was the missionary said, 'Jesus preached that we need to believe in ourselves and believe in each other.'  I'm sorry but this is not the message of the Gospel. Jesus told people to believe in God and in Him. He told them they needed to die to themselves in order to live in Him. If God is taken out of the equation we do not have love for our neighbors but a political ideology that is exactly the type of messiah that Jesus clearly taught he was not.  It might help if everyone opened the Gospels and got reacquainted with Jesus as he is there without reducing his message because someone tells us that isn't what Jesus really meant.         ",0

"1406","3180020","Student","       well, I woke up this morning around 10:30 b/c my phone was ringing....it was charley telling me to get my lazy ass up lol....that was quite funny.  I talked to him till about 11:15 or so.  I got out of the bed at 12:30 and I came downstairs and got on the computer.  I checked my mail and saw who all was on and stuff.  After that I went swimming for a little while just to relax all by my damn self a little bit.  After that I came in and helped mom clean out christa's room for a little while.  It sucked really bad. After about 2 hours of cleaning, I got on the computer again to check the air force academy website for picture's of chris again.  The other night me and mom got on it at like 12 something and looked through 4 days of pictures....It took up 3 and a half hours!  We found 2 of her on the day of in-processing.  She looked pissed at the world, which is how she's supposed to look.  We got a letter from her yesterday and it sounds like she's doing ok.  The altitude is really messing her up and since she's a vegetarian, she doesn't get to eat much.  She said in the letter that her meals consist of cold rice and veggies at everymeal.  They get 10 minutes to eat and in that time they have to say all this stuff before they can eat so its not actually 10 minutes! I miss her.  Anyway, after I looked for somemore pictures of her, I decided to write her a letter.  That took like an hour and then I decorated the envelop all pretty and stuff.... After that mom decided we needed to go to wal*mart, but we both needed showers so, I got a shower, then mom got one, and we got ready and went to wally.  I saw drew going in and then I saw jess at the 4-way stop thing....Christina was with her....:( *sigh* anyway, we got home at like 7:30 and me and momma are cooking steaks for dad.  He had to work today and he's supposed to be home at around 8.  Hopefully I'll get to go out tonight but I'm not gonna be mad if I dont b/c I know askin to do something is pushing it.  I'll keep those who care posted...  Well, we had steaks and potatoes.  They were really good.  Me and dad bitched at mom b/c she bought the crappy potatoes lol...it was funny.  I made pecan brownies for daddy.  They were good but not as good as usual b/c mom bought the cheap brand...:(  I cleaned up my room and everything and I asked dad if I could spend the night with Jana and he said no, then I went to can I go out and he STILL said no.  He says that he's sorry that I cant do anything, but he wants to prove to me that its not ok to be a smart ass to mom...I see his point, but 2 weeks sucks ass!

"1411","3178789","Publishing","    Formatting Friday: Forming Possessives   Briefly, most writers know that forming the possessive case for a singular noun requires an apostrophe  s  and a plural noun is  s  apostrophe.  The main reason for my research on the topic was to find out what to do when you have a proper name that ends in  s .  Someone who is very well educated in the education profession told me that it is also appropriate to use an apostrophe  s  in this instance.  But my research has told me that, by convention, certain proper nouns should form the possessive by just adding the apostrophe because an additional  s  would make pronunciation difficult or awkward.  The examples given are:  Jesusâ€™ teachings, Mosesâ€™ children, Achillesâ€™ heel, Herculesâ€™ strength, Ramsesâ€™ reign and Xerxesâ€™ conquest.  That's it for today folks.

"1415","3174354","Religion","             I didn't include politics as one of my topics of discussion but don't think I won't talk about it.  I watched John Kerry give his acceptance speech at the DNC in Boston tonight and I was disturbed by some things he said.  Overall, I believe John Kerry is an excellent communicator.  I thought he was calling the kettle black when he said, 'My friends, the high road may be harder, but it leads to a better place. And that's why Republicans and Democrats must make this election a contest of big ideas, not small-minded attacks.'  In his speech, John Kerry remarked that, 'Values are not just words. They're what we live by. They're about the causes we champion and the people we fight for. And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.'  I definitely agree and I am disturbed by how the family is degenerating to something that is undefined and chaotic.  I was very interested to hear what John Kerry had to say about family values, but everything he said about valuing families had to do with providing them with health care and body armor when they go off to war.  There was nothing about the morality of the family.  Which is exactly what was missing from the Kerry speech - the real issues.  He said a lot about the military and the middle class and health care and new jobs, but where was the talk about the integrity of marriage (oh yeah, he and his running mate were the only two senators who didn't have the courage to share where they stood on that issue)?  What is his plan on abortion?  What is his plan for the family?  If values are what we live by then what are his?  He said, 'I don't wear my own faith on my sleeve. But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day, from Sunday to Sunday. I don't want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God's side. '  What are those values, John Kerry?  And by the way, was John Kerry a veteran or wasn't he? '...when I was a junior in high school, John Kennedy called my generation to service. ' '...but because of what we learned as soldiers.' 'We fought for this nation because we loved it and we came back with the deep belief that every day is extra.' 'I know what kids go through when they are carrying an M-16 in a dangerous place...' 'I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president.' 'I fought under that flag...' 'But faith has given me values and hope to live by, from Vietnam to this day...' 'I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta...' We get the point!  Anyway, John Kerry would be a great president if he didn't believe in big government, and wasn't an immoral person, and didn't want to support stem cell research, and if he did have a problem with same-sex marriage, and didn't rip off President Bush's speech because he doesn't have one otherwise, and would let his wife think for herself (she was Republican when she was married to a Republican).  In short, he would be a great president if he were a conservative Republican.              ",0

I watch her funeral in the rain   Chris Isaak, 'Funeral In The Rain'   Someone told me long ago There's a calm before the storm, I know; It's been comin' for some time.

"1425","3148054","Education","       The New York Times has an  urlLink article  (free reg) about Sony's new venture into the ultra-high-end world of boutique electronics called  urlLink Qualia . Jewellery eletronics are nothing new.  urlLink Vertu  makes 'Precision Communications Instruments' which combine a rather basic GSM worldphone with a platinum, silver or gold cover. I agree that the Qualia TV looks damn cool, but a  urlLink Bang and Olufsen  unit is probably a better buy.  The same holds true for the Vertu units. Any of the recent  urlLink SonyEricsson  or  urlLink Nokia  handsets easily defeat the Vertu both in terms of their technical specs and functionality, but being mass-market items, limits their appeal to the elite that strive for differentiation.

"1428","3140337","Non-Profit","         So today on the radio they were discussing how young black females (ages 10 and above) are turning to dieting and plastic surgery at alarming rates!  They asked the question why.  I mean look at MTV's, 'I Want a Famous Face' and 'Extreme Makeover' on ABC and we wonder why young women don't appreciate their natural beauty?!?!?!  It is so sad that our society creates these false perceptions that skinny, big breasted, and light skinned or damn near white is the only way a person can be considered 'beautiful'.  It is one thing to diet for health reasons, but if you are a size 6 trying to get to a size 2... kinda makes me wonder!!  Try embracing your natural beauty, inner and outer, before subjecting your body to that much pain!  Love yourself :)           ",0

"1431","3136742","Student","           I find myself complaining often as I lay in bed- You need a girlfriend- then I realize that thinking is too simplistic. What you really need isn't a girlfriend but a companion, I grumble to myself subconsciously. To often to I go through this routine at night telling myself; sleep now, it is late and you will need rest for tomorrow. But I don't need that rest. All throughout the day I am to my own devices, which usually means I'll end up doing so little that I'm unable to recount the days events even before the day has ended. Of course I blame this on myself, but why? I've decided I need new friends (not to replace my current friends, but to make more *authentic*, symbiotic, creative friendships... and I wouldn't do something as chickenshit as telling my friends to fuck off over the internet.). My current friends are too wide and varied, and I keep them all mostly for a single attribute to their characters. There are many different groups and sub-groups, and none of them seem to like each other outside of those groups. I've got jocks, Jews, skaters, gamer-nerds, punks, politicians, metalheads, counterculture philosophers, cryptozoologists, and musicians, but no one of I feel I can really have a real friendship with. Pardon the attitude, but I'm just too damn sophisticated for the people I know. I love them all, they're all fun, genuine, great people, but...I think too much. I'm to creative, too philosophical. I need someone to bounce ideas off of, get into deep philosophical discussions and share debates on all topics from music to politics all over a friendly cup of espresso-- someone who appreciates and understands food like I do-- I don't have that. I can't argue with my current friends about why Pro-Lifers are wrong, or why, while God doesn't exist, religion is still quite necessary for some people, or even why Oreo's must be dunked-- I can't get into any existential debates with my friends. I'm left with my own thoughts and I don't want to end up like the closed-minded, idealistic hermit I'm headed towards becoming. My friends are simply there for shits and giggles, as am I. I need intellectuals. I need older, more mature friends. I can't be bothered with this teenage drama bullshit, I've got more important stuff on my mind! I swear, my friends talk about sex and it's like listening to a group of prepubescent girls talk during a pajama party! I happen to have testosterone running through my veins, boys, don't try to drag me into your myth and conjecture-based sexual discussions. I don't want to explain to you how babies are made! Well there I go, ranting about my friends when 1) I like them, 2) they're not the problem. I just want a friend with at least half of a clue of where I'm coming from. Somwone who doesn't ask 'Whoo?, Whaaaa?, why, dude?' when I tell them I'd give anything to play 'Sir Duke' on stage with Stevie Wonder, someone who actually pursues a discussion when I start talking about Wundtian Philosophy, Hemmingway, or government mind control, instead of just responding with 'Hey, remember that time we were lost in the Alps and we ate your legs for food?'... It's not that I'm tired of that shit, it's that I'm tired of still not having the kind of relationship I want. Now, I may sound too serious, and that might sound bad, but right now I don't have time for frivolty. I want to meet someone who I can  afford  to be silly with-- someone who can balabce out the silly with the serious and vice versa. Then I can be silly, but I need security first. I'm sick of being a goof and getting nothing in return. All this sounds like I'm depressed, but I feel fantastic. I haven't depressed in over a year. I've actually never felt better, aside from this cold I have (Who the hell gets a cold in July?). I weigh as much as I did in 5th grade, I'm reading more than ever, I've been coming up with great recipe ideas and eating better than ever... Things are actually great, except for my situations with my friends and my computers. But the things that are shitty are SHITTY, and I think I should have control over that, so I'm gonna try to change my situation. -can anyone relate to shit shit?  (and don't go giving me that 'grow up and quit thinking you're so smart' bullshit. It's not like that. I'm not one of those wannabes! One of those jerk-offs that takes AP classes and talks about themselves and their academics like they're hot shit, and then they end up going to some barely-above-half-decent college with 20,000 other kids like them! I've worked as hard as I needed to and it's not like I'm bragging all the time about dealings within the clique of my AP classmates- because there are none- I'm not one of  those  cunts!)   Now Playing (people should use this more often. It's interesting.): Jackson Browne-Pretender, Runing on Empty, Stay, Doctor My Eyes Stevie Wonder- Isn't she lovely, As, Sir Duke Hall and Oates- Rich Girl, Maneater, Sara Smile, I can't go for that.

"1432","3135317","Law","                 Martin rescued me from another late Friday in the office with a very well-timed call inviting me to the pub! I was happy to accept - I've not seen much of Martin since I started my fab new job and he makes me feel a little guilty about it - but then I did introduce him to Sophie, and I hope they both remember that in a few years time when they are choosing Godparents for their first born.  I had to let him buy my Diet Coke 'cos I'd left my purse strewn across my lounge floor along with most of the contents of my handbag, having left hastily this morning - v late for work and cussing a handsome tall Irish cutey who manages to get me into trouble despite being hundreds of miles away and my firm resolve to go to bed no matter how funny or appealing his messages might be! I really must learn to get some more will-power!  I collapsed on the sofa when I got in just after 7 - I managed to grab a few winks before the phone rang and disturbed my slumber - it was Jack- he'd fallen out with his friend and needed picking up. Normally by that time on a Friday I'd have poured the best part of a bottle of wine down my neck and would have had to send him home in a taxi - but having slept, the wine was slowly reaching room temperature and I was still alcohol-free - apart, of course from the remains of last night's excess still seeping out my pores. So I obliged, thinking he would be waiting meekly on his own near Kwik-Fit. How wrong was I!!  There was a mob - not kidding - with Jack in front - I drove around the roundabout and pulled up on the brow of the hill, expecting him just to get in and maybe give Torven a lift home too. I wasn't expecting a brawl to erupt over my bonnet and Torven to start thumping ten bells out of Jack - and then kick my car!!! He's so blonde and quiet - and Jack was not retaliating in any way - not that I imagine he was entirely blameless - but he's twice the size of Torven Cosmo! and is very aware of the damage he can do - he was ever so upset on the way home - crying, apologising - it all started over a daft bobble hat - see they are just still kids even if they are starting to feel a bit more grown up and don't know what to do with their testosterone.  Anyway, he's gone to bed after a bath and a cuddle with his mum - he's got a big athletics meeting tomorrow - and then he's hoping I'll take him to the Designer Outlet near York on the way home but I'm hoping it gets too late - I like having money left at the end of the month instead of the other way around. But I also like having a very lovely son, who really is maturing incredibly well - and just the best company ever - shame his friends are not all quite at the same state of development yet - glad I'm not a teenager anymore - just behaving like one!!

"1441","3128727","indUnk","       Itâ€™s seven thirty and the sun is still up.  Iâ€™m weighed down by something Al Pacino said, â€œAs soon as I get outâ€¦the pull me back in.â€  He might as well have been talking about me.  Today was a fight not to show up at work, my unit readying itself for QRF (Quick Reactionary Force) and tasks are coming down the pipeline as fast as they can be dreamed up.  The eyes of my subordinates keep turning to me, and if they canâ€™t see me they leave voice messages on my cell phone.  My leash.  Iâ€™m getting tugged around, just trying to keep my head down and out of the line of fire.  The old maxim, you canâ€™t shoot what you canâ€™t see is one that Iâ€™m doing my best to abide by.  Iâ€™ve been slipping around like a spy, trying to keep my profile as low as possible, trying to be seen by as few as possible.  Iâ€™ve been using shady tactics.  You donâ€™t get in my door during the work day unless you call from the threshold, and you donâ€™t get me on the phone unless you pass the caller ID test.  And itâ€™s not that Iâ€™m scared, no, Iâ€™m stacking the deck because I know Iâ€™m not needed.  And I donâ€™t want to be needed.  I canâ€™t help, Iâ€™m too far out the door, itâ€™s not just one foot thatâ€™s out, oh no, itâ€™s one foot thatâ€™s left in.   This late in the game, and I need a jet plane.  I need an escape.  Cut the scene and turn the page and start me with a header that reads Ext. Day. Greenwich Village. Start with the action block that reads:  As the sunshine streams down MacDougal street, Brad is seated outside of CafÃ© Regio, the green over hang proclaiming it the birthplace of cappuccino.  Heâ€™s drinking coffee though, and heâ€™s drinking it black despite the fact that locals and tourists alike are strolling about in various methods of the khaki shorts that are in fashion this hot summer day.  A cigarette burns between drags in the white recesses of an ashtray, and when heâ€™s not smoking or sipping idly at the coffee, heâ€™s scribbling idly descriptions of passers-by in a notebook with a silver fountain pen.  And following those descriptions are stories, dallyings in the fantasy selfs of people that might never see themselves as heâ€™s watching them, might not go home to the significant other that he paints for them.    Of course the news broke yesterday, roughly six thousand troops called up, men and women who just two days ago believed in their hearts of hearts that they were out.  They were done.  Now, theyâ€™re all holding their breath and watching the phone.  How many of them saw both the Tigris and the Euphrates?  How many of them know they can pull the trigger, know that hesitation is the real killer, that the men that they are fighting are just that men, but damn it, if youâ€™ve got to pull the trigger, then obviously youâ€™re pulling it for a reason.  How many of them never want to be put in that position again?    A glass of absinthe down, and the tangent isnâ€™t stopping.  August and Everything After, the song, not the album which bears its name but in which it doesnâ€™t appear, is on repeat on the stereo.  My cigarettes are smoking themselves.  â€œI hope you donâ€™t expect me to be crucified.  The best that they can hope to do is hang me from the nearest tree.â€  Well, find the tree, but while youâ€™re looking for it, you might as well be looking for me.  I should be working on my book, or running through the edits on my screenplay, or redrafting another screenplay.  I should be on the phone with my agent, wondering whatâ€™s going on with my first novel.  I shouldnâ€™t be unwinding after a day of close calls and sudden excuses.    And the horrible thing.  Iâ€™m quite certain that if called on, Iâ€™ll go back to Iraq.  One more time.  Because Iâ€™ve never run before, not from something like this.  All I want to do is disappear, but itâ€™s the things we do that we donâ€™t want that really define us.  This song, August and Everything After, I got into Iraq in the last week of July.  I started setting out on the road, started getting shot at in August.  And now August and Everything After has sought to define me.  It was in August, near the end, that I started writing my novel, my first real masterpiece.  I wanted it to be grand.  It was a way for me to live a life that I couldnâ€™t see, couldnâ€™t touch, could only dream about.  But when I wrote about it, I might as well have been there, that might as well have been me.  I donâ€™t know which one was me, but I was there, in the bar with them, and I was there as they sat back and sought refuge in absinthe, in cigarettes, in ideals that they couldnâ€™t touch but reached for any way.  And I tired to explain what I was doing, I tried to put my protagonist in the same spot.  I had him write a book, and I had him live his life through that book.  Why?  Because misery loves company.  Because I was at a point where I had to shut everything off, where I had to be so strong that emotion was a luxury I had to strip myself of.  And if Iâ€™d told myself that at the time, it would have seemed like I was making a big deal out of nothing, but I remember when it peaked, I remember riding in the back of a five ton truck, and I wanted so badly to make it back to the FOB where the illusion of safety at least existed, and I was leaning over the rails that ran along the bed of the truck, and I had my weapon, my M-16 aimed at oncoming traffic and I was counting my shots before I took them.  Iâ€™d look at the drivers of oncoming traffic, men just going somewhere, men with out malicious intent, and I gave those men a mental ultimatum, you can do this and only this and youâ€™ll live.  Keep driving.  Donâ€™t look at me.  Donâ€™t reach for anything.  Donâ€™t swerve.  Iâ€™m putting my first shot into your chest.  Iâ€™m going to bury my second in the block of your engine, saw it in a movie and hell it just might work.  The third Iâ€™m going to put in your front left tire so your car fishtails and stops.  Iâ€™ll be out of this truck by then, and Iâ€™ll come over to your car, and Iâ€™ll pull anyone left out.  And then Iâ€™ll inform you that you failed your test.  That was it, that was the bottom.  After that I started to relax on the gun.  After that, I realized Iâ€™d gone and stared into the darkest portion of the human.  Call it a heart, call it a soul, call it a mind, call it whatever the hell you want.  I stared into it, and allowed it to wrap its arms around me for one day.  After that, I found the war rhythm, the system you develop when you spend enough time out of the wire.  You learn how to spot whatâ€™s wrong, what doesnâ€™t belong, you learn that thereâ€™s a pattern in everything, it might not be mathematical, because itâ€™s a whole lot simpler than that.  Itâ€™s easier than two plus two.  It just is.    I have to get off this combat kick.  Iâ€™m almost out.  And as soon as I start to get out, they drag me back in.  I need to work tonight.  I didnâ€™t work last night.  Iâ€™m not sure if I worked the night before, but the fact that I was sober leads me to believe that I didnâ€™t.  I donâ€™t know.  I need to work.  Why?  Because Iâ€™ve got too many questions right now, and work solves that for me.  I need to get out.  Iâ€™ve got so few days left in uniform that itâ€™s almost funny.  So close, freedom is there.   I'm certain because I want to know if I can walk away from that blackness one more time.          ",0
"1442","3126397","Technology","             I guess I better start packing a can of mace, and a cell phone on my evening runs.  Tonight a big black shinny SUV and a smaller white car where clandestinly parked window to window in the darkest, most remote section of my usual route.  Maybe it was just a happy couple meeting for a late night chat, but I certainly ran quietly, and with heart all a flutter as I passed them in the dark.  I really wish Caldwell would invest in some decently lighted biking and jogging paths.  Oh well, I guess it's better to die of gang violence than heart disease.... Right? Interestingly I had a run in with the other end of the spectrum on my way back from New Meadows last Saturday.  I was following a big shinny blue pickup down out of the mountains, listening to Led Zeppelin, and not paying attention to my speed when the pickup and I passed a police officer going the other way.  In my rearview mirror I saw him brake and come about.  Looking down saw that I was going about 65.  After pulling me over, the officer explained to me that the speed limit stayed at 55 until I got to the other side of Cambridge, and then changed 65.  Nuts I thought, my first speeding ticket after 7 or so years of getting away with all manner of moderate speeding!  He then went on to explain that he was going to turn the drug dog loose on my car, and that it would 'throw itself against the car if it found something' but not to worry because that just meant he could then search the car.  To further increase the pressure, he told me that if I admitted to carrying anything before he turned the dog loose he promised to give me the mildest citation possible.  To admit, and keep the dog off, apparently I had to stick my arm out the window and wave while he was filling out paperwork.  I kept my arms firmly in the vehicle, and when he came back he asked if I'd thought about his question.  I told him I did not have anything like THAT in my car, and he sent me on my way.  No dog, no ticket, hardly even a warning.  I think he was wishing he would have gone after the blue pickup. In more cheerful news, according to  urlLink this set of benchmarks  my computer will play  urlLink DOOM3 !!!  This game is so freaking cool and scary that I hardly dare visit it's web site at night with my speakers on.  I'm not sure whether I'm looking forward to playing it, or dreading the nightmares more.

"1445","3114656","Student","       This past Friday  The Day After Tomorrow  premiered: a happy-go-lucky romp about the end of the world that overwhelms in thanks to global warming. If you turned on the news at all on Friday, you would have the pleasure of hearing the mainstream media talk endlessly about the validity of the filmâ€™s claims: the devastation of the world will not only occur because of our own doing but it will happen in a weekend. While I was watching the â€œcoverage,â€ the following question kept bouncing around in my mind:  Is there really so little going on in the world that precious time can be spent talking about if a claim in a big budget disaster film is valid?   This remains me of the endless discussions about genetic engineering that cropped up right after  Jurassic Park  opened. Of course itâ€™s not possible, itâ€™s fantasy: itâ€™s a movie. As a testament to that, CNN brought on my favorite TV personality scientistâ€”Bill Nye (the Science Guy)â€”who spent most of his air time explaining the complicated processes of the weather phenomena depicted in the film and all the hostess could ask is â€œBut Bill, could this happen in a few days?â€ to which Bill finally and flatly answered, â€œNo.â€ After Bill left, CNN continued to discuss the movieâ€™s political ramifications as if thereâ€™s no difference between disaster happening over a lifetime (as Bill said was the fastest speed it could happen) and two days.  A lot of this silliness is nested in the public: if we see it in a movie, thereâ€™s legitimate reason to believe it can happen. Thereâ€™s a lot of money and time wasted exploring ideas that some one saw in a movie. Thereâ€™s a lot of panic that ensues because people take entertainment too literally ( War of the Worlds , anyone?) Letâ€™s leave the science to the scientists.          ",0

"1449","3104592","Arts","       Let's talk for a moment about breastfeeding.  What are my qualifications, you ask?  I'm a mom.  I have breastfed 2 children, and if I ever have any more children, I look forward to the opportunity of doing it again in the future.  The benefits are countless.    1) Breastfeeding aids in the prevention of breast cancer.  2) It is scientifically proven to be better for children, both for it's physical nutritional value and contribution to healthy brain development.    3) Antibodies (see #2)  4) Mother and child bonding (once you get through the initial pain - cracked and  bleeding nipples, the possibility of public boob exposure, and the occasional biting - once teething begins...)  5) Prevention of allergies (see #2)  6) Less diaper bag paraphernalia (like bottles and formula)  7) More constructive use of time (instead of needing to purchase bottles and sterilize them, heating water, mixing formula and water - usually resulting in some sort of mess)  8) Economical (booby milk is cheap)  Need I say more?  To all those macho feminist who don't want babies, I argue that giving birth and breastfeeding is extremely empowering.  How could it not be?! Only a woman has the ability to create and sustain life with and within her body.  Well, ok, we can't create completely alone. We do need that sperm from you guys, but we do all the work.  Not to mention, physical scars.   I recently went bathingsuit shopping.  Not fun, when you have stretch marks.  Especially if you are partial to 2 piece bathing suits, and honestly, most stores don't carry a large variety of cute one pieces.  I have a virtual road map of stretch marks lining my abdomen.  My daughters ask me all the time, 'Mommy, why do you have scratches on your tummy?'  I very gently remind them, even to the point of pulling out pictures of me pregnant, that they are from them.  Not in a blaming sort of way, more like a reminder of what I was willing to go through because of my love for them.  'It's squishy, Mommy!'  And I love them for it.    No matter what anyone says or what products claim to be able to do, stretch marks are genetic.  Bottom line: if your mom has them, then you are likely to as well.  I was prepared for mine, but I still fought them like hell.  For 9 months, my bathroom constantly smelled of cocoa butter and other products that promised to 'prevent stretch marks'.  Nevertheless, around 6 1/2 months into the pregnancy, my tummy started to itch, and then these little spots appeared.  It was kind of strange to watch them gradually progress, as my stomach grew, from round marks to long jagged lines as my stomach grew.  It wasn't like I was huge.  I only gained about 35 lbs with each of my pregnancies (by the way, I think that Kate Hudson reportedly gained 70+ lbs. with her pregnancy).  So, I embraced my 'battle scars.'  After Cara (my oldest) was born and my body started to recover, I was relieved when I realized that the stretch marks just fell short of coming out of the top of my bikini bottoms.  A few months later, even before my hair had stopped falling out (another fun post-pregnancy thing), I found out I was going to be having another baby.  I had already lost more than my pregnancy weight, and I thought that my stretch marks couldn't get any worse...   The other day, I showed Cara which stetch marks were from her (all of them), and then I turned to Adia (my youngest) and told her, 'See up here, the top inch of all of these is from you.'  Being a mother of two has stretched me farther - in more ways than one, sometimes farther than I think I am able to go.  The girls seem almost proud to own the responsibility for my stetch marks, and so I think I can bear them unabashedly.  I bought a new bathing suit the other day.  A 2 piece.  I will show the world that I am empowered, and I hope I can do my part to empower the next generation of women.           ",0

"1465","3083205","Law","             Some commentators have&nbsp;raised accusations of  urlLink 'foolish demagoguery' &nbsp;on the part of those who  urlLink suggest the   urlLink iPod is at risk  due to the proposed INDUCE Act (IICA).&nbsp;   The accusation is hardly an exposure of some overblown or empty&nbsp;argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;That argument has always been a very solid and moving metaphor.&nbsp; It is absolutely true that the iPod itself will not be threatened by IICA, but not because IICA is well written or not threatening to technological innovation.&nbsp; The iPod will   only  &nbsp;be off limits to lawsuits because of what lawmakers have said  urlLink on the record  during the IICA hearings, where they specifically stated that the iPod was not a target.&nbsp; Congress would not attempt to remove from the market a device that has been available to consumers for several years.&nbsp;  urlLink Orrin Hatch  stated as much himself  urlLink here :   For example, there is a mock complaint circulating that alleges that the Apple iPod violates S. 2560 because mp3 players would never have been commercially viable but for the preceding, massive wave of for-profit filesharing piracy that was defended by groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation. A real court would respond to that mock complaint in two words: Complaint dismissed. The caselaw states that no one can 'induce' unlawful acts that have already occurred.     Consider this  - IICA passes and several months later the iPod is released.&nbsp; Do you think that Apple would not be the defendant in&nbsp;a lawsuit&nbsp;considering the current language of IICA?&nbsp; It is clear that they would not only be targeted, but that their 'Rip, Mix, Burn' campaign may well have been enough evidence&nbsp;to meet the&nbsp;general intent level&nbsp;necessary for a finding of&nbsp;inducement to infringe.&nbsp; Hatch's position, as&nbsp;quoted above,&nbsp;does not defend a product that induces more infringement than has already occurred.&nbsp;   So in one or two years when&nbsp;the iPod becomes available with a&nbsp;200 gig harddrive, much more music than the average person owns, is that going to induce more infringement?&nbsp; Maybe we'd learn the answer to that in court thanks to IICA.  No, there has been no exposure of a bunch of 'Chicken Littles' that has damaged credibility. When&nbsp;one must,&nbsp;one fights fire with fire. While IICA's authors were fully prepared to launch their campaign for support of the bill based on accusations that the P2P nets were to blame for child porn&nbsp;and other criminality (IICA&nbsp; was originally to be called the ' urlLink Inducement Devolves into Unlawful Child Exploitation Act '), the opponents of the bill had to figure out how to draw the public's (and the media's) attention to IICA's problems.   The answer for anti-IICA activists to draw attention to their comments&nbsp;was to use the image of Congress taking your iPod away. Was this whole campaign some big lie?  No way , any product similar to the iPod that is developed after the passage of the INDUCE Act will be at risk of a suit because of the current broad language IICA.   The language of IICA is now&nbsp;being rewritten because of the great opposition to the bill, but that opposition didn't materialize out of thin air. It was created based on the work of activists who researched the issues and spread the truth about IICA - that it threatens to stifle technological innovation in devices capable of copying content.&nbsp; That some of those activists sought to illustrate the threat to technological innovation via a metaphor&nbsp;people could relate to is no crime, it is in fact a testament to the resolve, creativity, and intelligence of those activists.  In fact, the only reason the 'Chicken Little' accusations can even be made is because activists worked so hard to bring IICA to everyone's attention, including those who now accuse them of overstating their case.

"1466","3082812","Arts","       This is a French film and I saw it in Japan so there were no subtitles for those parts but they're not too hardcore and I got the gist so everything was fine and dandy. Except the movie's kind of weird. The plot totally centers around 2 women, one an anal middle-aged writer, the other a promiscuous young girl. The action takes place at a house in a quiet French village and involves a little eating, drinking, smoking, fucking and dancing, so they covered their bases well. I'm not sure which parts were real and which weren't and I don't think it matters, it's one of those films you just submit to and come out at the end going, okay, cool. Sometimes I despair that I'm not a straightlaced person with a fully functioning mind that's capable of saying yes and no and start and stop at the right times in all aspects of life from work to the bedroom. But this movie reassured me that it's better to be an interesting fuck up than a dull perfectionist. Maybe. Hopefully.            ",0

"1483","3056329","Government","           Ok, this blog needs to be spiced up once again. So what did everyone think of the great and rather humorous documentary?   First of all, in the film so often you'll see all the 'weird' cultures, and the people in these communities/sect will be so proud of their culture and heritage and religious practices.   To go off on Mrs.VA's commment that 'we don't see our own milieu when we are living in it', I believe this statement to be mostly true. If a person has never moved to a different state/country, then that person will always see himself as a 'normal' human being, because they are so immersed in their culture in which they were born. But when you move, that's when you will discover your milieu, and when you move to a drastically different place you also can more objectively see the milieu of your new home. That happened to me several times already, first the culture shock when I moved from China to California, and then I then I brought an interesting mix of Chinese/California culture when I moved up here to Vancouver Washington.   Here is just a list of the many many milieus of Vancouver, if you don't realize already:  1:As Erin mentioned: 'ALL THE SUBARUS AND SUVS!!!!!!'(this is a very interestiing discovery as I moved here, I guess even Georgia has much less SUVs) 2:Ski and Snowboarding Crazy(Go figure with all the outdoor opportunities here) 3:People drive soooooooo painfully slow and very carefully obeying the speed limit(Compare to California....You'd be kidding if you sped just 10mph above the speed limit....in California 50 mph 5 lane highway completely jammed with 80mphers) 4:People very much obey the law, the society as a whole is a lot more strict and calmer.(People very rarely question authority here, I can elaborate on that later).  5:The society's pace is soooooooooooo slow(downtown stores close before dark, what???? that's unbelievable in california) 6:I've never heard the word 'Spendy' before I moved to Washington 7:Fast food dominates(somehow people are ok with fastfoods here) 8:All these wetlands and storm drainages(which of course the 'rain milieu' of washington) And there are many many more.............Milieus and these subtle differences of cultures are what's so unique about every place, everyone of us......Catch a glimpse of New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, Honolulu, Victoria(BC)......Wow what a range of different milieus.   Too often have I heard people calling each other 'you are not normal', or people urging me to 'just being a normal person'. But I will often ask back, 'what do you mean by NORMAL?'. 'How do you define normal????' Because 'a normal' human being is different in each culture/country, and you have to have a firm grasp of the milieus of that culture to be normal. Like people will always see me tapped on with Chinese culture, even if I realize it or not. And I will not try to act like everybody else just because I want to look like 'a normal person', because THERE IS NO NORMAL PERSON, especially in America.   The immigration and custom scene where people from all corners of the world feeling all patriotic and excited to become an American Citizen is simply a phenomenal picture patented for America. After all, America is a country founded on uniquenesses and differences and immigrants and we continue to pride ourselves for that. And thus in America, the world 'normal' is moot and there is simply NO NEED FOR NORMAL! America has always to protrude out from the world as NOT BEING NORMAL!!!!!! In the land of the free, uniqueness is happiness; And differences drive our country forward;          ",0

"1488","3040702","Arts","           6:32 a.m. Monday, Day 36.  The first day of WEEK SIX.  A nice fresh week. Hoping it will go better than last week. I barely managed a save on Sunday to stay under oppw.  It helped a lot that I didnâ€™t drink.  However, I did eat two Ritz crackers after Iâ€™d done my totals, so I refigured for those this morning.  I didnâ€™t want to, itâ€™s such a tiny amount (32 calories) and I was thinking along the lines of â€œoh, I can let myself have this just this once,â€ but quickly came to my senses and nixed that. What the hell am I thinking, let myself have this one?  I mean, I can eat whatever I want, thatâ€™s not the issue. The point is that itâ€™s useless to record my food if Iâ€™m not accurate. I donâ€™t have any problem with eating the crackers, but I canâ€™t let myself get into that kind of thinking with this journal, because then whose journal is it? Some fictional person who sounds like me a lot of the time.  Watched the Super Bowl yesterday, voluntarily.  Itâ€™s the first football game Iâ€™ve watched in probably 20 years. Not bad, it was actually interesting. I think itâ€™s because the photography is so much better. You can really see what happens, and the replays are great. I suppose regular games donâ€™t have so many cameras working, though.  And that reminds me, although I donâ€™t know why, that my BRAS are fitting differently. You see, all this time Iâ€™ve been concentrating on the lower half, and I forgot that the boobs are the first thing to go. And hopefully also some back fat.  I mean, I am THRILLED to lose weight on my boobs, but I donâ€™t see them as the culprit that my gigantic stomach is. So anyway, first I thought the bra had just gotten a bit stretchy from old elastic, but no, the others are fitting the same way.  Iâ€™m buckling them in the middle row, not the loosest row. So yay for me. Or my boobs. Oh yeah, now I remember why it reminded me: Janet Jackson.  9:05 a.m. 50 minutes on the glider, and only 402 calories.  Iâ€™m kind of dragging today. I think it was the movie. Iâ€™m watching Lovely and Amazing, and it sort of sucks.  Itâ€™s about a woman and her two grown daughters, and itâ€™s a total chick flick, but itâ€™s dreary and stupid. The women are so fucking neurotic theyâ€™re not amusing.  I cannot relate to a single one of them, even though one is a 36-year-old woman trying to sell her arts and crafts around town. But sheâ€™s so bitter and awful and bitchy, even I canâ€™t relate to her. Thatâ€™s pretty bad.  Iâ€™m toying with the idea of putting this diary in reverse order. Most recent entry at the top of the page. I donâ€™t know, itâ€™s a trade-off.  It would be easier for me to search, because most recent food would be close, but I like to read back over the past few days, and itâ€™s easier to do that in this order. I donâ€™t want to get TOO wrapped up in the journal, I spend enough time in here as it is, but I guess Iâ€™m jealous of the websites I see. Also I really need to go to the supermarket today, and have zero interest in doing so. Itâ€™s so damned far away!  I guess I could shop online, though, and then just pick it up. But what the hell, the shopping part only takes me 20 minutes. Itâ€™s the 40 minute round trip drive that I donâ€™t like. I might decide to go to Harris Teeter, which is slightly closer.  10:57 a.m. Yay yay, Daisy called me. Unfortunately she has to go to work today, but then we can go out at 3:30. Can not wait. I am so dying for some social life. I think it has given me enough energy to go to the store. Whee!  1:08 p.m.  Yeah, yeah, I bought more chocolate covered almonds. However, this time I bought the merest handful. A trifle.  And in other weird news, I had two pieces of bacon for lunch. I wanted to get some bacon to have with our shrimp; one piece used to flavor it, split between the two of us, canâ€™t be too bad. And I was surprised that the calories are so low. Well, I thought, this isnâ€™t such a bad deal, Iâ€™ll just have a couple pieces with lunch. That was before I cooked it; after I cooked it I wondered how 1.5 linear inches could possibly use up 80 calories.  Apparently I need to buy a higher-quality brand.         ",0

"1491","3037556","InvestmentBanking","                 So each year on the 4th of July we watch the Ralston Parade and then walk up the street to my sister, Nicole's house for a cookout. She invites the whole family over and they have beer and brats and it's a lot of fun. This year Omaha Jitterbugs is in the parade. We'll be dancing and walking and handing out info on our events. Afterward it'd be cool to have a cookout with all of them. I asked Nicole if I could bring them over. She said that would be fine. Today dad called and said that if I brought that many people over, the family would be uncomfortable and they'd all leave and that's not what this is about. So I told him that Lindsay and I were talking and since we didn't know who was coming and that it might be a large number we decided that we'd have to plan something else. Told him we'd probably be having people over to our apartment and grill out for ourselves. So, now we've gotta make some plans for 4th of July.  It's not that I expect that we should be able to bring a ton of people to her party, but since dan & Tiff will be in town and we'll have to bring them with us, and if Laura comes to, then others from the parade will want to continue to hang with us if they don't have other plans. It'd be rude to send them all home at that point, and say taht they can't come, so of course we'll continue to hang out with all our friends that want to, but now at a different location.

"1506","3025353","Religion","             Normal people fantasize about sex.  Pundits fantasize about politics.  Lately the pundits have been dreaming up some pretty kinky stuff.  Take  urlLink Cal Thomas .  He sees--Ooh baby--Hillary Clinton emerging from a smoke-filled room in Boston wearing nothing but a sash with the words 'Democratic nominee' stitched on it.  All because Brother Cal read a column by some unhappy liberal grumbling about John Kerry.  You don't need to be Sigmund Freud to interpret this dream.  Republicans were so pumped about running against Howard Dean.  Then the Democrats had the audacity to not throw themselves over a cliff.  They nominated John Kerry instead.  Now Kerry is a 'Massachusetts librul,' but the GOP punditry has had a harder time giving themselves over to unabashed Kerry-hatred if the Democrats had anointed Dean.  After all, Kerry's a war hero, and Republicans know it, even as the more scurrilous among them slander his war record.  Since Super Tuesday Brother Cal and his ilk have been suffering from  coitus politicus interruptus .  So they fantasize about campaigning against the one they hate most of all, 'Ms. Rodham Clinton.'   urlLink Clarence Page  hopes that Colin Powell will complete the all-male review on the stage in Boston.  There's something about the man that makes liberal hearts go pitter-patter, even though he stiffed Bill Clinton when Clinton needed a new Secretary of State, even though he failed to prevent this disastrous war, even though he, in all probability, knew the case for war was a sham, yet closed the deal anyway with his tour-de-force before the Security Council.  Colin Powell?  Tall, dark and handsome Yes, but Vice-President?  Only if we go back to the days when the Vice Presidency was a job that, in the words of one of FDR's VP's, 'isn't worth a bucket of warm spit.'  I'm not sure whether men view pornography because they're bored with their spouses, or if they're bored with their spouses because they view pornography.  Likewise, I don't know if the pundits are bored with the Kerry/Gephardt,Edwards,Richardson ticket because they fantasize about implausible political scenarios, or if they fantasize about implausible political scenarios because they find Kerry/Gephardt, Edwards, Richardson so boring.  Either way, it's time these men stopped living in a fantasy world.         ",0

"1510","3016686","Education","       Everybody knows that I love pop music and treat it with the same passion and critical ear that I would any other type of music.    Janet Jackson has always been a really solid pop artist. Her CDs between 1986 and 1993 were  perfect . Now, post  nipplegate ,  when Janet should be seeking to regain credibility (malfunction, my ass!), she releases the turd that is 'Damita Jo.' Poor J-Ho seems to have fallen victim to the same Diva Curse that afflicted Madonna, Mary J. Blige and many others recently. This CD is a bunch of underbaked midtempos and finger-snap-beat sex ballads that sound like rejects from her '93 'Janet' CD.   Her usual lame-o interludes are here too: last time it was between-take Fran Drescher imitations and this time it's faux interviews about her history. A last-minute attempt to string this record into some kind of autobiographical narrative?   This would be fine if you were a HOOKER and your life revolved around giving head in parked cars.  How many Janet tracks do we need that give her explicit instructions on oral love? Especially if said 'head' belongs to jheri-curled midget maestro Jermaine Dupree?  Blech.    Is this all she has to say at 37 years old?  Come back to the rhythm nation, Janet Jackson, Janet Jackson!    The single 'I Want You' is somewhat of an Alicia Keys ripoff, but it does have a sort of lush, carefree sweetness. I particularly like the 'have your way with me' bridge, which is a tasty come-on, but not dirrrty.  There are maybe 4 other tracks worthy of Janet and the rest is craven drivel.   Anyhoo, I will not link to Amazon: you can pick this one up used and cheap, like the woman herself, at your nearest used CD bin.          ",0

THE END...........    Love can make you happy although often times it hurts.But love is only special if you give it to which it's worth.  Bottomline : If you found someone who truly appreciates you, he/she deserves more of your love.   Two tear drops were floating down the river. One teardrop said to the other, 'I'm the teardrop of a girl who loved a man and lost him. Who are you?'... 'I'm the teardrop of the man who regret letting a girl go...'  Bottomline : Nobody will sympathise a person who constantly let chances passes by without making any efforts to salvage. We normally don't realise how important our loved and closed ones are until they left us, we'll start reminiscences which results misery.     ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   ps- it may not be the best essay or story tat u have ever heard of but.....it is a really nice one if u truly understands it............hey, i still got few story to tell....................haha........wait ya....

As I mentioned in my April 19 post below, I have to rip back to the short row section because I started the waist decreases too soon. For me to rip back requires total and complete concentration. However, I haven't found the time to devote my full and undivided attention to this task. Waah!  I'm leaving on a 11 day trip to Nicaragua tomorrow and I still haven't decided if Shapely T will be my traveling project. Come to think of it, I would get 7 hours of pure knitting time on the plane - hum... well that is if Airport Security will let me on with my knitting weapons, oh I mean, needles.  Other than a Bon Voyage post, I won't be posting here or on my  urlLink knitting blog  until I return. However, I have set up a travel blog where I am chronicling my journey to Nicaragua and back. You can find it  urlLink here  if you're interested. Shameless plug - I know.  I look forward to seeing everybody's progress when I return!  Ciao!         ",0
"1519","2992646","Non-Profit","        I was just going through some of my old emails from the time I spent in Edinburgh, and it really has struck me just what a glutton for punishment I really am when it comes to love.     I have yet to have a fully-functional, long-term local relationship. I kid you not.      I  nstead, I fall for people like  Gavin . Gavin was a co-worker at one of the offices I did some temp work for when in Edinburgh. I had it bad for him as soon as I saw him and his eyes (big brown puppydog eyes). Basically we began an email/work flirtation, that at least for me quickly morphed into some hardcore feelings. During the end of my second week at work, and my last day seeing him there (he was going to be on vacation for my entire last week), we met outside the office and he kissed me. To this day he is the only person who has rendered me starry-eyed and seeing fireworks during a kiss. We only saw each other a few more times before I left Scotland (he, of course, had a girlfriend whom he wasn't prepared to break things off with for a girl who wasn't around for long), but the boy broke my heart. It was my own fault for falling in love with someone I couldn't have, but it was the most excrutiating pain I've ever felt in relation to love. It took forever to get over him, as well. He used to talk about coming to the States to work for a while, which never happened. We haven't been in contact for ages. Part of me would like to see him, just once more, but I know that's a bad idea. It was just weird reading through our old emails to and fro, it's like reliving the whole thing, to a certain extent.         I want a nice, normal relationship with a nice, normal boy who won't make me fall in love with him only to treat my heart like a pinata.             ",0

You know you're Jan-Harm when...  Your voicemail greeting message is so long, you feel it's necessary to remind people they're listening to a message. Blowing your nose requires an above average intake of carbohydrates. The new box of tissues you brought in that morning is gone by 10am. You think whining is an appropriate way to ask for help. You create annoying nicknames for your co-workers. It's important for your yogurt to be well shook and that not a single drop be wasted. You use words and phrases like 'jeepers', 'on the farm' and 'that's retarded'. When communicating that you understand, you find it necessary to say 'sure' twice. Since sometimes people look like they don't believe you. You answer questions by repeating random words within a co-workers statement. You spend vaulable work hours hanging out by the vending machines or in the bathroom. Filling out your time card is an all day affair. And....I haven't come up with the zinger that goes at the end of these lists...so, this will just have to do for now.  Perhaps I'll add to it later...              ",0

It's all pretty and new and no more than 3 clicks worth of work. Part of me thinks it's cheating and sheep-like to use a template...the other part thinks that sometimes, it's just easier to cheat and really, it's not like this kind of cheating is hurting anyone. Other than perhaps myself, but I don't think I'm going to go be a web designer anytime soon, so....yeah.  I'm looking at an Abbyless weekend, followed by an Abbyless week. I was initially kind of excited by this prospect, as I've sort of, kinda had my fill of people (think extended family, for an extended weekend) and I haven't had much quality time with the PC recently. But really, I was wrong. I think this is what I want: just me and a computer with high speed internet and cable tv but in the end, I am so totally *wrong*. So what do I want? What do I really, really want? I want to be annoyed by the fact that Abby wants me to pay attention to her when I'm trying to get something done. I want to eat popcorn and drink orange juice with her while watching some horribly bad movie/tv show. I want a new couch, so I can cuddle with her without breaking one of us. I want to break one of us while trying to cuddle on my horribly bad couch. I want a cat. I want a cat that likes Abby better than me cause any cat of mine should and, no doubt, would. I want her to beg me to go on walks with her and to watch her read her dumb romance novels. I want to pretend something she reads to me from them is actually funny and for her to do the same when I read something to her. I want to eat peach and raspberry sorbet: one spoon, two mouths. Most of all, I just want her. Here, with me. Forever.             ",0

So as you know from an earlier post, I had been looking for an original copy of the song 'Money', and finally one day on a long and lonely bus ride to the Ape caves, I found it on one of Emily's CDs. Now I never found out who sung the song, I just immediately 'borrowed' the CD and burned myself a copy of it. So just now I was putting the CD onto my computer and 'Money' comes on, well my dad says, 'This is Pink Floyd,' And I'm like 'No it's not, it can't be!!!' He's like 'Yes it is, it's from Dark Side of the Moon.' Now this was just unfathomable!!! I've had Dark Side of the Moon forever, and never listened to it all the way through!!! The song has been within my grasp for many a year and I've never found it!!!! And to add even more irony to this entire tale, I'm the one that burned Dark Side of the Moon for Emily in the first place, so I'm the only reason that she has that song!!!!

"1531","2965840","Student","                     Well i have been really busy lately and havent had enough time to post in my blog so sorry yall.  Lately i have been working on an AP European packet which is the devil.  It is insanely hard and time consuming, thx Ms. Patty.  And this is for everyone who doesnt know already, I made the school newspaper staff as a writer so i think thats pretty cool.         First off i feel bad because i havent talked to anybody (the busy-ness is overwelming) so if you are reading this (the very few that still check up) sorry and I am partly free to talk because Im done with Euro.           The school art show went off pretty good, it was probably really boring to the guests because once you walk through the room, thats pretty much it.  The band was interesting, not the stuff i heard on the demo, but thats alright i guess.  I thought they were ok and i liked the tribal dances and bongos.  I had a lot of fun working up at ticket sales, i think the people that came are weird, they kept handing the money to the wrong person.  After that i went to jacks game and had some fun with kat and garrett for like an hour.         Angel was on last night, it wasnt very good, cept for the reference to a little 'party' involving Dharla and Drucilla.  The Fred thing was sad and i miss her character and i dont like where they are headed with Ilihara.  The whole Immortal thing is horrible, i dont think this apocalypse actually has a story to it, we know just about it as much as the characters do and for that fact, as much as the writers (who probably make it up a week before it airs).  They killed Spikes character and they are driving Angels into the ground.  Is it just me or are spike and angel getting gay?  They act weird together now and its very disturbing.  Next we will see angel and spike falling in love on their path to be the champion *shivers with disturbance* Remember what angel said at the beginng of the season where he had no prob spanking men?  That was just the begining.  Oh man Joss, if u happen to stumble across this humble little journal, then heed my words, KILL SPIKE!!!! AND MAKE ANGEL AND BUFFY DO IT!! AND BRING BACK ANYA! KILL WOODS AND BRING BACK jenny, o and maybe professor walsh and what about that one lady, whats her face, buffy's first roommate in college, and molly and amanda and vi.  Just a thought Joss.          Well kiddos thats all the time that I have for today so ill see you next time aboard the magic school bus!         ",0

"1534","2960957","indUnk","       Monday, Monday.  I have a love-hate relationship with this day of the week.  It's either the day where I have a fresh start and am ready to start a new week refreshed or it's the day that I dread all weekend long and show up to work sluggish and out of it until around Tuesday afternoon.  I'm somewhere in between those two today.    My weekend was spent sleeping for so long that I had too much awakeness to know what to do with.  I was so alert that I couldn't even fall into a relaxing nap on Sunday afternoon or even go to bed early so I could get up at blasted 5:30am the next day.  I hate being too rested.  Then again, I dream about that state when I am majorly exhausted.  Aye me.  So hard to satisfy.  NOt always, but sometimes.    So I joined that gym on Friday.  I figured I was falling into an exercise and diet rut...slowly but surely and it was time to find the distractor and change in my plan.  I've always wanted to do this gym-personal trainer thing once I've worked out on my own for a while and it's cool that I'm doing it.  I blew off working out this weekend, justifying my appointment on Wednesday.  I hate when I do that, but that's where I am right now.  ick...writing about it makes me that much more uncomfortable.  Let's analyze shall we.  REASON 1:  Fear.  Fear of, oh I dunno, giving up, gaining tons o weight, eating unhealthy all the time, eating healthy all the time and missing yummy foods, starting yet another cycle of doing it then stopping then doing it another way then stopping, etc.  Well, that pretty much sums it up.  Hey, now I'm aware.  I can stop there, stop thinking it to death and actually ride it out and do it.  I haven't given up yet.  Let's count the ways I haven't given up. - I bought good stuff at the grocery store - I ate good for me stuff on Friday night - I signed up for a gym membership and fitness assessment appointment. - I ran twice last week. - I brought my lunch to work today.  Gurl, go on.  Who said it would be easy?  Do it to it.           ",0

She has to have grilled salmon, corn on the cob, baked beans, different salads, different deserts, your preferences of store bought or homemade bbq sauce, guacamole, salsa, etc. etc. It's insane how ahmazing she is in the kitchen! Yeah, I'm sure you're thinking that's a lot of food for a lot of people, right? No, no! Even if you come over to her house on a Tuesday, she'll make you the same thing if not something more and/or better! And you have to watch her too because if you tell her that you're taking home ONE dish, she'll slip the rest of the leftovers into your container or onto your plate.  Oh, her family is absolutely marvelous! They kept me laughing the entire time. You know how sometimes you'll go to someone's bbq and you'll feel uneasy because you're in a room full of strangers? Ohh, that soooo doesn't apply when her family comes around. They use it as an opportunity to bust out some of their latest jokes and pervertedness. I loved it!  The best part of the evening was when I got to hold Merrilee's son, Carter! Ohhhh, my word!

The weather is starting to get nice but the cold and wet still lingers.  We want to pack up our sweaters and bring out the shorts and t-shirts.  I'm waiting for the city to come alive again. For people to be walking on the streets and for the sound of motorcycles and the sound of kids playing outside.    Changing seasons in Wisconsin is like going on a roller coaster ride.  We stand in line for what can sometimes be hours.  Slowly making our way up to the platform.  We talk to each other about all the different color gums stuck on the walls and the guy 3 rows ahead of us who keeps picking his butt.  Then as we get closer to the platform, the line stops.  What's going on up there?  The ride better not be broken, we think.  Then we start moving a little again.  Then we're held behind the yellow line for what seems like an absolute eternity.  Craning our necks past the wall watching for the coaster to return, our hearts jump as we see it.  We're just waiting for that silver bar to open and let us free.  Then it's off for the crazy ride, we fight a little about which side of the car to sit and the operator warns us to keep our hands and feet inside the car at all times.  Screaming through each loop and over each hill and each jerky corner, we don't want it to end.  Then as soon as it began the car is slowing down and pulling back into the station.  That was too quick we think.  Maybe the operator will let us go again.  As the lap bar releases we pause just a few moments pretending we don't have to get off.  We even pause on the ramp exiting the platform and look back to see all the happy faces getting on the car and taking the seats we just had.   Then we go stand in line at another roller coaster.     wait    v. waitÃ‚Â·ed, waitÃ‚Â·ing, waits   1.  To remain or rest in expectation.    2.  To tarry until another catches up.  3.  To remain or be in readiness.  4.  To remain temporarily neglected, unattended to, or postponed.  I hate waiting.             ",0

Your move. I like to think there is an ultimate balance, and my balance will come back to me soon. I just hope it lasts a bit longer this time This is a really good quote from Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  It is a pretty odd show and takes a certain mind set to understand, luckily I have that extreme mindset! -do you see what i'm talking about?! -no I don't but I'm sure it will get you arrested  Long nights, longer days... all this time, really busy, and yet I don't really know what I do... hmmm I needed a change so I hoped the next train to Colonia, that was nice, and then stayed up all night doing the paper I didn't do all week.  Then work, class and home to see my sisters. I made all of my siblings cds on my new PowerBook G4, Jacquie was so cute she put on her head phones and sung 'Hey Jude'.   It was that childhood innocence that was so endering.  She's actually pretty good. I found out today I can't go to Florida with them.  It pisses me off cuz the only way I can go is if i bring Ross. I can't drive by msyelf that long, and I'm not allowed to bring ne one but Ross. I think my Dad and Diana like Ross more than me. So its been a few weeks since a binge of drinking...  Funny thing about AA meetings.  You go, they all talk about God (even though it's not religous supposedly) and they all drink coffee and smoke, exchanging drinking for smoking and what not.  Most turn to fundamentalists, or just go back to drinking to shut them all up about God.  There should be a better system not based on a religion.  But you know... it makes for good books (Fight Club, Choke).  Sex addicts have an even more interesting way of dealing, but that is another blog....

"1549","2943631","Education","            Comfort zone...   In an ok place right now.  I am not on the top of the world, but close to it for now.  If it weren't for a few things I think I would be on top.   First the bad, I found out yesterday a friend from my old life, from way back to high school is in the hospital.  He had a little trouble with his meds, and had a little overdose.  He is being transferred to a facility down south a little closer to his family who all migrated back down there years ago.  The other thing is one of my close alies at work has gone a bit off the deep end and taken my competition for this sales contest as personal.  She is constantly talking down to me when I make an error in paperwork or don't know an answer with '  Oh that's ok your new, we'll forgive you being stupid, you don't know any better.'    So I hit back the whole contest as I have been outselling her...'  Umm don't you feel bad, the new girl is beating you...but that's ok, I'll forgive you, because I'm new.'   I guess it got to her more than I thought.  She is a mamma's girl goody 2 shoes, or at least that's the airs she puts on.  From what I know of her, she is 6 months my jr, still lives with mom and dad, never left home, and while in hs and college was a little drunk ass, drug addicted whore, and those were her good points.  Today she made some digs that she had no idea how much they hurt about mental health issues.  She also called me loser as I was coming in behind her, even though she claims she said booger,yeah right.  I have been known to be a sore looser, but the only thing worse than a sore loser is a sore winner.  She sold less than I, yet she sold at the right time and ended up with 2 rooms at the casino, $50, and a paid day off.  I sold 2 more than her and got $40.  I don't get the whole incentive program at my company, but I do have to say it is a little bit fucked when the top producer gets shafted.  I have to ask myself why push so hard next time?  But then I have the same answer, because I have to.  I can't ever accept failure, I don't allow myself to fail if at all possible, and it was this ethic that has brought me far in the past and will serve me well for a long time.  The baseball game was excellent, I loved being hostess.  The game was great the guests were great.  It was even more polarised than the last time.  All but one of the women were gathered inside while the boys watched the game. I don't even really miss the whole group of men watching sports thing. It is nice to be included in the little tribe of women.  I can not explain how much it means to me to be accepted in.  I am one of the lucky ones who blends nicely into the whole realm of womanhood.  Many are not so lucky. Of course after the guests all left before the game ended because we were up and it was late.  I sat with my feet up and watched the game comfortably from a great seat.  I got a few looks but who cares? I did have to deal with my least favorite group last night too.  Teen age girls.  I have no idea why they give me such fits and nerves, but they do.  One is ok, 2 or more freak me the hell out.  Teenage girls are brutally catty picking on  anyone and how they look.  While I pass fine with the adult crowd, my hair and makeup are not the in teen thing, and my clothes are purposefully loose which is another teen faux pas.  So they whisper, and the whole time you wonder, are they talking about me, is it my style, or do they make me?  I know as Co has told me time and time again, the whole world is not concerned about me, but it is hard not to think that around teenage girls.  I hope to get over this before my daughter becomes one.  Only a little bit more than 7 more years to go.  So over all things are ok.  Jobs are good, even though I didn't win the prizes I still sold the most ads,and earned the most revenue.  I sold just under half of our total ads, this with a total crew of 8 working on it.  Friends are ok, but I still worry, fam is ok.  I do have a new worry that I didn't know could happen thanks to JR. JC and the boys, never mind nightmares, you are giving me daymares too.  I won't go into it much but it involves a complication from someone she knows who didn't take care of their new equipment properly.  I guess allot can happen if you don't take care of it, or yourself.  In the revenge file, I just found out today that someone from my old job, but I have known much longer is in dire financial straights with their business.  I won't say who because it is not nice to spread the word on sorrow.  They were one of the nasty ones to me over this.  They were turning the old rumor mill on me, even though I asked them not to out of respect for Co and the kids, who they knew.  It didn't matter and the rumors flew faster than anywhere else.  I am sorry for the folks that work there that they may lose their jobs, but I shed no tears for the owners.  It may take awhile but bad things do get paid back.  This one took a longer time, and like I said they were from way back in my life, so Karma is a bit backed up right now.  I hope the good stuff works faster than the bad for all of you, even the ones who will get the bad someday.  Love to all and take care.         ",0

"1555","2930795","Technology","       This trip to australia has definitely had its share of highlights of good days, but 24 days on a work trip can wear.

"1558","2922061","Publishing","        (I posted about this poll below; 71 percent vs. 17 percent makes this a highly atypical case)   By The Associated Press  Anti-American sentiment in the region of Iraq where four U.S. civilian contractors were killed and their bodies burned and mutilated is far higher than in the country as a whole, according to a nationwide poll of Iraqis.  In the province that includes Fallujah, seven in 10, or 71 percent, said attacks on coalition forces are acceptable political action. Among all Iraqis, just 17 percent held that view, according to the poll, conducted before the attack on the contractors, by Oxford Research International for ABC News and several European networks.  More than half in the Anbar province, which is heavily populated with Sunni Arabs, said that attacks on foreigners who work with the coalition are acceptable, while 10 percent of all Iraqis felt that way.  Four of five in Anbar say the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq was wrong, compared with about half that many Iraqis in general. And by a 2-1 margin, residents of Anbar were more likely than Iraqis generally to say the invasion humiliated rather than liberated Iraq.  The poll was done for ABC, the BBC, the German broadcasting network ARD and the Japanese network NHK.

From: Dunham Maj Oliver H  Sent: Monday, June 28, 2004 6:12 AM To: Jim Hake Cc: Lutkenhouse LtCol John F; Chandler Maj Thomas E  Subject: sewing center  Dear Jim,  The local TV station we have been supporting with your donated media gear did a news spot on the new sewing center that opened in Ramadi. The station did a 14 minute segment set to music, with interviews of different people interspersed throughout the segment.  The center has actually been expanded into what the Iraqis are calling a 'Women's Center' (the sign reads in English below the Arabic, 'The Organization of Creative Women in New Iraq'). The Iraqis will be planning use profits generated from the sewing to fund women's education (English, computer skills, etc). This is huge and is exactly the direction we are trying to drive things as it runs counter to the agenda of the extremists who are fighting to keep this part of the world mired in the dark ages. During the segment, they panned to new furniture (purchased by us), school-type desks and new computers (I believe provided by CPA), and of course, the sewing machines set up on tables, each one being its own sewing station. They are saying that 900 families will be supported by the center though I think that may be a little bit of an overstatement as locals here are sometimes apt to do.  That said, the Iraqis had a true ribbon cutting ceremony.  There was a darling little girl who was holding one end of the ribbon while a man cut the ribbon. One of the Iraqis interviewed (I believe he is the director of the center) thanked the Governor for the assistance that made the center possible.  Because we are approaching the transfer to sovereignty there was no Coalition involvement in the opening of the center.  Thus, though the Coalition was not mentioned; we still see this as a win. Any time the interim government gets credit for something that benefits local people, it increases support for the interim government.  Support for the interim government means greater stability, which is what we need to get Iraq through the transition period.   There is still a fight here, but we are making progress.  Thanks again for the help.  Holden         ",0
"1560","2922061","Publishing","       Conservative columnist  urlLink  Michelle Malkin's   new book takes a revisionist look at the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Needless to say, the book is highly contrversial, both for its attempt to shake an anti-American shibboleth, and because -- Malkin being a political writer -- it is as much concerned with modern-day issues such as immigration restriction and racial profiling of Arabs.  I haven't read the book; I plan to soon. (First I have to finish 'Hamilton,' which is a great read but is beginning to irritate me because of little historical fact-slips that I keep encountering: for instance Chernow seems to think the British 1777 campaign against Philadelphia disembarked in the Delaware Bay, not the Chesapeake.)  On the one hand, I roll my eyes when I see history taken up as a weapon in a current events debate. It's like watching a Jackie Chan streetfight in an archaeology museum. Circumstances always are too different to allow realistic comparison, and it's usually the history that ends up twisted and bruised, while no one's mind gets changed about the current events.  But on the other hand, I'm glad to see this one brought around for a fresh look -- even though, as with Ann Coulter's bid to re-animate the reputation of Senator McCarthy, I wish it had been done first in a pure historical context rather than as polemics.  So until I can read the book, I'm following a fascinating debate on its historical merits on some of the 'conservative' Web sites I favor. UNC law professor Eric Muller has a series of critical posts about Malkin's book  urlLink  here.   Malkin, though tending a sick child,  urlLink  has begun to write in response.   It's aggressive, fact-filled, dignified stuff. In case you think someone just said, 'round up all the Japs and throw away the key,' there's a rich story here of Roosevelt's dilemmas, cloak-and-dagger spying, Japanese imperial culture, and state's rights vs. federalism.  One of the reasons I feel more comfortable now in the company of thinking-people who are considered 'right wing' is that they are, in my experience, more capable of examining an argument structurally, logically, and also willing and able to plunge into the stacks and go do some real historical research to see if it stands up,  even if it is an argument from someone they essentially agree with.   I'd compare that favorably to the left's embrace of the Michael Moore carny show: 'warts and all, he's one of us, and that's what matters most.'  I'd compare it as well to the typical thinking-person liberal  urlLink reaction to Malkin's book.      Michelle has written a new book which explains why interning the Japanese was such a great idea (I'm guessing it also advocates internment camps in present-day America for Arabs, foreigners, and people of color). Thanks to Jim for alerting us to Michelle's book.  We'll review it in a day or two. You know, after we think of enough snarky things to say about the publisher's description and the cover.    And that was on the thoughtful side of the spectrum. On the less-thoughtful side are reactions  urlLink  like this:     This woman's parents are immigrants from the Philippines and she does nothing but badmouth immigrants and liberals alike.  I really think the bitch looks in the mirror and imagines that she is a blonde WASP. ... If it was up to these neo-cons that she loves so much, she would be working in a massage parlor, a sneaker factory or a whorehouse someplace ('Five dollar, me make you holler; ten dollar, me love you long time!').  She is an Asian Condi Rice, only not as intelligent. Like Ann Coulter, she is SO full of herself, it's pathetic. I feel sorry for her children.    Yikes. And that kind of stuff goes on a good deal on leftist sites. If you want to watch someone called a 'race traitor' or some outspoken woman put down as a 'whore,' go find a message board full of self-proclaimed 'liberals.' If you want to understand why I still consider myself true to my liberal upbringing, yet now find myself aligned against such people, take a look at which side is dealing with the argument and the book, and which side just gets off on ridiculing a young Asian-American woman.  When I was fighting most of my fights on the left side, I argued -- pleaded -- with my liberal friends to study history. I was reading lies and distortions from the 'Christian America' cult, about what the Founders said and intended, and they all went unanswered because, it seemed, liberal and secular people had no interest in claiming the past. They had conceded it to the enemy.  Robert Byrd is a rare example of a liberal/Democrat leader who can talk and write authoritatively about history across a broad band. Of course, his background is rather atypical for his party. To many people on his side of the aisle, history is an embarrassment, the dark night that a progressive mind seeks to lead the world out of. American history in particular, to a modern politically liberal mind, can look like a sewer of racism, Indian-slaughtering, commie-hating, anti-foreigner bigotry, naked greed, sexism, slash-and-burn eco-cide, homophobia and all things il-liberal.   urlLink [Paradoxically, academic historians these days tend to be strongly left-leaning; but that's another post.]   The great voices of religious freedom and secular authority -- Jefferson, Madison -- are tainted in modern eyes by being slaveowners. One of the most liberal books ever written, 'Huck Finn,' gets banned by liberals because of the N-word.  I don't think I'm exaggerating the right-left divergence here. People who think strength of will and debating to win are honorable skills do not also tend to be pacifists and consensus-seekers. People who don't make a habit of intellectual combat training don't know how to react to something forcefully argued, but which they sense to be wrong. In that case, an ad hominem attack is the easy route to venting your frustration with what you can't force to be silent.   * * *   As for the internments, when I was in high school in the 1970s, studying 20th century history, some of my peers used the example of the Japanese-American internments to make the point that the U.S. was 'no better than Nazi Germany.' They weren't right-wingers or neo-Nazis (most of my classmates were Jewish, in fact), but that was the reflexive sort of anti-Americanism you got if you were around young people in the immediate post-Vietnam War era. At least it was so where I grew up, in the wealthy suburbs.  But even then, when I was a Reagan-hating wanna-be hippie, I had sense enough to know that this was nonsense. People came out of the U.S. internment camps alive, reasonably well-fed, and often with children they didn't have when they went in. People came out of Buchenwald piled like garbage on flatbeds.  I've heard it argued that the Japanese-American internment was obviously a mistake because no Japanese ever helped Tojo invade America, and many were eager to fight for their adopted homeland. Many were eager to fight, that is true. But it's also true that we never got a chance to find out how many others would have reacted to a Japanese invasion of the West Coast, because none ever took place. (Except in the Philip K. Dick parallel universe, of course.).  That doesn't mean the internment camps were a good idea or that I wish to defend their use in World War II America. But when you think about decision-making in history, the first thing you have to do is step back and  forget that you know how it's all going to turn out.  Then you can judge Roosevelt, or any man or woman from the past.

"1580","2872565","Education","           Things have improved so much at work!  The new school semester in Korea began this week, and so as a result we have new students and a new schedule.  Many of our former kindergartens have graduated up to elementary levels, and there's quite a lot of new faces around the school these days, including some new teachers.  Things are much more organized now than they were before.  In my first three weeks of teaching things were still very much 'in transition' and I never really knew what was going on.  I just took it day-by-day and a lot of times just had to make it up as I went along (lessons and such.)  Well now we have textbooks and worksheets and formal lessons for the kids, and it makes my job so much easier.  I actually have a pre-set curriculam to follow and it's so much nicer to have proper materials to work with!  I can walk in everyday knowing what to expect and I think the kids are enjoying the new materials as well.  Also, my schedule varies a bit, so some days I start at 10am, and others 11am - both times work well for me and I'm thankful that I don't have to wake up too early!  One thing that I definitely appreciate about this job (that I was not able to enjoy while working at Delany's) is never having to work at the crack of dawn, and always having my entire weekends free!  I think this is the first job I've ever had in my entire life where I have both Saturday and Sunday off every single week - IT'S AWESOME!!!  I've been watching a fair bit of TV these days during my weeknights and I've made a lot of observations.  And thanks to the tape that Barb sent me, I've been able to do some comparative studies between Korean and Canadian media/television programming, and particularly with commercials.  For example, in Korea, a lot of times you get all your commercials at once, at the beginning of the show generally, and then you get to watch the entire show straight through uninterrupted.  This is both a blessing and a curse.  It's great to be able to watch a show without having some annoying commercial break it up, but to have to sit through ten full minutes of commercials can be agonizing sometimes!  I've noticed that there's two main styles of Korean commercials - there's the 'music video', and there's the 'infomercial.'  The first is very enjoyable and kitschy and fun to watch, the latter is not!  Most commercials here tend to be very energetic and lively and super cheesy full of pop or rock or techno music, with the actors dancing around or being extremely animated.  Lots of Western music finds its way into these commercials and it can be hilarious!  For example, I've seen a commercial for instant noodles featuring Mary J. Blige's 'Family Affair' where the guy in the commercial is trying to woo over a saucy Korean vixen who's grooving and moaning against this wall at a party, with her own package of instant noodles, rockin' out to Mary J.  And there's another one I've seen with Kelly Clarkson's 'Miss Independent' that's used in a cell phone commercial, where some sexy Korean chick is getting blown through the air around downtown because of these waves magically coming out of her phone 'what is this feeling taking over...'  Very cheesy, very funny!  And then there's the informercials, which are  sooooo long  and  so annoying !  They are honestly a full ten minutes long (one commercial, for ONE product!) and are structured just like how you would see on The Home Shopping Network.  Often the commercial will repeat itself so it's like having to watch it several times in a row.  These infomercials always have the same ingredients: one absolutely useless product + one Korean male in a suit who invented it + at least 2 Korean women who act all excited about the product while either demonstrating it or discussing its amazing qualities + one hot Korean female model to make you watch the commercial in its entirety + one audience full of fake cheesy actors to 'ooohh' and 'ahhhh' at just the right moments + one fake award/'official' recognition of some sort (ex: Best Invention Of The Year!: 2002!) to make the product seem more credible + an amazing and sudden slashing of the price to make it seem like it's on sale + one or more *Wow! Free!* other useless shit products thrown in to close the deal.  The result is a cookie-cutter recipe for selling useless shit on TV (pretty much the same style as Western infomercials!)  These  commercials were mildy entertaining at first, but when you have to watch the same ones over and over, it gets really old, really fast!  I've learned to just 'tune out' when these annoying Korean informercials come on screen, but this has caused an unusual side effect while watching Western programming....  When I was watching the tape full of shows that Barb mailed me, I felt *compelled* to watch all the commercials and pay great attention to what the sponsors were trying to sell!  It's like because I almost never hear anything English (as in on the streets, on the bus, or while channel-surfing here) that anytime I do hear English, I  HAVE  to stop and listen!  I've become so accustomed to just not hearing my native language on a daily basis that whenever I do it almost  shocks  my ears, who do a 'double-take' and just have to SOAK IN whatever it is they're hearing, even if it is just a silly Tide or Sleep Country Canada commercial on a tape that my friend sent me.  Why this is, I can't explain, and it's a little disorienting, I must confess.  I'm not sure if I should laugh at myself, or be concerned!  :-)         ",0

First, I think JT's on the right track about Tyler Houston.  He's got some pop, a career 724 OPS against righties, can play 3rd and back up Ensberg, and is much better than Viz.  I wish he drew more walks, but what the hell, we're kind of desperate.  I say DO IT.  And you gotta love the PR from having a last name of Houston.  Second, there have been some really good articles (most of them subscription-based, unfortunately) about the Top 50 prospects (anyone can see the final list, actually) at  urlLink BPro .  The good news is that it's entertaining to read - the bad news is 0 - the number of Astros on the list.  NONE!

That's not a great sign for the organization - we need some good drafts/trades in the next few years.  Hey, it stopped snowing!

"1596","2845838","Internet","              June 16: Cwazy Cwazy Dweam   There was a Pink Party going on and all of us in the account were dancing onstage like crazy. Everybody was having fun. Atoy, our account manager came up to me on the floor and touched my arm and offered me a ride home. And I refused. The next day, I was late in (sort of) a class with the rest of my colleagues. I forgot to login but I eventually did it halfway my shift. Rob was sitting on my chair, so I would have to sit to the chair next to him. He was sitting between me and Ivy.  He made me really angry because he deliberately touched my waist. Chancing kaayo sha! And I gave him a look of disgust at his attitude. He really annoyed me!  Ivy and I were talking in our office canteen and i told her how strange it was that Atoy offered me a ride home, and Ivy agreed because he's not like that with the rest of our colleagues, even to her. I also told her how annoyed i was with Rob. He's so touchy and ew. ew. ew! So we were there chatting... Peering from the outside through the glass window was mungkey. I remembered he wanted something from me sometime before. I did actually left it on his PC, just kind of posted it there (it's sort of a report on pieces of paper) because he wasn't around. Later that time i realized he wasn't able to get it. so i then remembered getting it back because it was left on his PC unmoved. So let's go back to him peering at us from the outside wearing a blue cap his face so close to the window. Later I realized Ivy was outside talking with him.  And then I had a dream about humans turning animals and animals turning humans. Then I remember Ivy, she loves cats and she promised this one cat to sleep with her in our room (and we're not even room mates), but i hate cats. and I insisted that i don't want that cat inside our room. She gave in anyway, when the cat walked away and as Ivy closed the door the cat was looking at me, somehow disappointed at me... then he turned into a human being.  I then remembered that same human turning into another animal and he crossed the carmen river to help two humans on the other side trying to turn off a fire on the hill. The setting was at my home, fisla village. I went my way walking towards my home when i saw another real horses running after fake human horses... Then i remember standing at the back of our old house. a very very big white bird flew in but was trapped because of the trees that i have to held it up high (upside down, his beak facing towards me) so it won't reach the ground, so it won't fall. and it had difficulty in breathing. I breathed on its beak to help him.  And guess what, the bird was not really comfortable with me, i sensed that this was the cat that Ivy likes...  Then there was our work routine, the setting was in an auditorium not in our office. On the corner, math people were having their review for an upcoming examination. I can recall using bangles on our hands instead of raising a flag to call for a supervisor or ask a supervisor a question. I remember Papa and Mungkey at a corner observing somebody taking live calls.         ",0

"1606","2834611","Advertising","                  urlLink FindLaw's Writ - Dorf: Does the First Amendment Protect Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake?   ---- Does the First Amendment Protect Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake? A Brief Primer on the Constitutional Law of TV Decency Regulation By MICHAEL C. DORF  ----  Wednesday, Feb. 04, 2004  Faster than you can say 'election year,' the breast seen 'round the world has given rise to a federal probe of the Super Bowl halftime show. That's right. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell is investigating the entire halftime show, not just the breast-baring finale.   According to Powell, Justin Timberlake's exposure of Janet Jackson's right breast during the closing moments of the halftime show 'wasn't even the most offensive part.' Powell claims that 'the whole performance was onstage copulation.'  Onstage copulation? Isn't that the definition of 'music video?' Apparently Mr. Powell is unfamiliar with most of the MTV oeuvre.  Was the halftime show unsuitable for the millions of small children watching? Sure. But so are half the shows on prime-time television. And more importantly, the First Amendment provides that 'Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.' How, then, can the FCC impose fines on the halftime performers and broadcasters, as it has threatened to do?  The late Justice Hugo Black, who fashioned himself a First Amendment absolutist, liked to dismiss arguments for censorship by waving the Constitution and exclaiming that ''no law' means no law.' But his brethren did not agree, and so, notwithstanding the First Amendment, Jackson, Timberlake and the broadcasters may indeed find themselves in hot water.  The Framework for FCC Regulation  Because licensing is necessary to prevent competing broadcast signals from drowning one another out, Congress and the FCC have long imposed a quid pro quo: in exchange for valuable FCC licenses, radio and television broadcasters must accept some limits on their programming.  As I explained in an earlier column, there is real doubt as to whether the scarcity of the electromagnetic spectrum actually justifies limits on the content of broadcasts. Other means of communication rely on scarce commodities as well; yet the Supreme Court has not allowed the sort of intrusive regulation of other media that it permits for broadcasters.  But in any event, even putting aside the differential treatment of different media, it is clear that broadcasters still retain substantial free speech protection. To give an obvious example, a federal statute or regulation barring programming critical of the Iraq war would clearly violate the First Amendment.  Such speech on matters of national importance, however, is a far cry from a sexual display. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has upheld the FCC's basic framework for regulating obscene and indecent programming. A federal regulation imposes a blanket ban on 'obscene' material, and restricts broadcasts that are 'indecent' (but that fall short of being obscene) to between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., when, it is assumed, few young children will be in the audience.  Are the FCC Obscenity/Indecency Regulations Constitutional?  Supreme Court precedents confirm the constitutionality of the FCC regulation. Obscenity, as defined by the Court in the 1973 case of Miller v. California, refers to works that, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest; contain patently offensive depictions or descriptions of specified sexual conduct; and on the whole have no serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. Because the Court has ruled that obscenity is not protected speech, the FCC may ban it entirely.  By describing the 'whole performance' of Timberlake and Jackson as 'onstage copulation,' FCC Chairman Powell may have been laying the groundwork for an obscenity charge. Such a charge would likely fail, however, because the performance had serious artistic value.   The portion of the obscenity test that looks to artistic value is not meant to distinguish between good and bad art or even between highbrow and lowbrow art, but between art that presents itself as art and 'art' that is, in reality, a thinly veiled sex act. Thus, playing a Mahler symphony as the background music for a hardcore pornographic movie would not bestow serious artistic value on the film.   Whatever FTC Chairman Powell may think, the Timberlake-Jackson duet was more than merely a sex act in the guise of art. Though hardly to everyone's tastes, both are mainstream pop artists who have sold millions of recordings. Their duet was better described as a very sexually suggestive musical performance than as sex set to music.  Accordingly, the FCC will likely proceed not under the obscenity ban, but rather under the prime-time indecency ban, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1978 case of FCC v. Pacifica. That decision sustained the commission's power to sanction a New York radio station for broadcasting George Carlin's monologue on 'Filthy Words' in the middle of the afternoon.   In Pacifica, the Court cited the interest in protecting children, as well as the fact that people surfing the dial might inadvertently find themselves listening to what the Justices described as 'offensive' if not obscene material. Since the same interest and risk are present when it comes to television, the TV primetime broadcast indecency regulation is constitutional according to Pacifica.   That leads to the key question: Could the Jackson-Timberlake duet be deemed 'indecent'?  Is a Bare Breast 'Indecent?'  The FCC regulation's definition of 'indecency' sets a lower threshold than the constitutional requirements for 'obscenity.' It defines indecency as 'language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community broadcast standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory organs or activities.'  Is an adult woman's bare breast necessarily indecent under this definition? Probably not. One can certainly imagine circumstances in which the mere sight of a bare breast would not, or should not qualify, as indecent--a medical report on breast cancer or a frame of a breast-feeding mother, for example.  Nonetheless, Jackson's breast was bared in a sexualized setting; her costume was ripped open by Timberlake in the course of a number that included the lyric, 'I'll have you naked by the end of this song.' The deluge of subsequent viewer complaints and the general outcry have made quite clear that some substantial portion of the TV audience found the display 'patently offensive.'  Indeed, as far as the First Amendment is concerned, the FCC may be on stronger ground precisely because the performance included a bare breast. In the 2000 case of City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., the Supreme Court upheld a ban on public nudity, which had the effect of forbidding dancers at an adults-only private club from completely baring their breasts.  To be sure, there are three reasons why the Pap's precedent may be inapplicable. First, the Court was fractured, producing no single opinion that spoke for a majority of the Justices.  Second, Pap's involved a rationale for regulation that clearly does not apply to Jackson and Timberlake. In Pap's the Court was concerned about what it characterized as the 'secondary effects' of the adult entertainment industry: prostitution and other criminal activity that tends to increase in the vicinity of such establishments. It can hardly be argued that the brief display of Janet Jackson's breast was likely to lead to an increase in criminal conduct in many of the places that the Super Bowl was seen.  Third, the law at issue in Pap's required female erotic dancers at least to obscure their nipples with pasties. Janet Jackson's breast was adorned with a pasty; if Pap's can be read to say that there is a constitutional right to display naked breasts in public so long as they are decorated with pasties, then perhaps the halftime show falls on the protected side of the line.  But that is a big 'if.' The Pap's case more generally affirms the principle that the message of an erotic performance is not unduly undermined by a rule requiring that dancers be at least somewhat clothed. If that's the First Amendment rule for an audience consisting entirely of consenting adults, it's hard to argue that the Constitution is more permissive for a worldwide broadcast to millions of unsuspecting viewers, including millions of minors.  Is State of Mind Relevant? What if the Broadcasters Did Not Know in Advance?  CBS, which broadcast the Super Bowl, claims that it had no advance knowledge of the Jackson-Timberlake finale. Somewhat less credibly, MTV, which produced the halftime show and promoted what it billed as 'some shocking moments,' has also pleaded ignorance. And Timberlake has blamed Jackson's exposure on a 'wardrobe malfunction.' Does it matter whether some or all of these protestations are true?  Certainly it would be unfair to impose criminal sanctions for an honest mistake. Suppose that during the course of the game itself, the uniform of one of the players ripped open, exposing his genitalia. If the camera lingered on the scene, then surely the broadcasters could and should be held accountable. But if, as appeared to be true in the actual halftime incident, the network cut away within a second or two, it would be hard to find fault--unless one had reason to think that the whole incident was planned in advance.  Thus, putting aside FCC Chairman Powell's interest in investigating the entire halftime show, the FCC inquiry will likely focus on whether the exposure of Jackson's breast was planned, and if so, who had advance knowledge of it. Powell has promised a 'thorough and swift' investigation.  What a terrific idea! If only such alacrity were envisioned for the inquiry into what was known by whom about, say, Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.               ",0

Itâ€™s a habit since I usually use the cell during the day and then my home phone at night.  Besides, my cell doesnâ€™t get good reception in my apartment.  Anyway, I later turned on the cell to find a voicemail message from Jay yelling â€œIâ€™m driving through Brooklyn and am completely lost!  Help me find a way out of here!â€  Oops.  Sorry I didnâ€™t get your message when you needed it, Jay.  Hope you found your way out sooner or later.  Hilarious sketch on SNL last weekend!  It featured Rachel Draitch as â€œDebbie Downerâ€, a woman who always knows how to ruin a good mood.

It was supposed to have been played completely deadpan but the entire SNL cast including Lindsey Lohan kept cracking up and breaking character throughout the entire sketch and that made it even funnier.  Sure to become an SNL classic.  When 9-11 happened, I figured that it would end Hollywoodâ€™s habit of making disaster movies.  Surely, after witnessing the actual collapse of the Twin Towers, who could stomach such similar fictional scenarios?  Well itâ€™s been two and a half years since 9-11 and disaster movies are back.

We just want to see shit get destroyed.  Well â€œ10.5â€ gave us the destruction of the Seattle Space Needle, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the entire coastline of Southern California.  Soon Hollywood will give us â€œThe Day After Tomorrowâ€, where the entire world goes to hell!  So soon after 9-11, is this in the best taste?

Actually, less an 'invasion', and more of a 'presence', but moving on...  These bloggers talk about a variety of items, the main theme being 'the Sun Times shouldn't have reported this, they're endangering US soldiers lives'.  If it's true (that we're sending troops to Pakistan, then, yeah, I agree).  OTOH maybe this throws me in the 'conspiracy theory' camp, but maybe, just maybe, the gov't WANTS/REQUESTED that the Sun Times file this report - especially given the particularly canned response from the author of the article - as seen in  urlLink Black Five's  write up.  Let's look at the situation: A US presence in Pakistan would be suicide for Musharraf.   Check There have been attempts on Musharraf's life lately (two that I know of).   Check These attacks (if not staged to garner more US support) scare the US.  Check Musharraf has previously said that the US will not ever put troops on Paki soil.   Check Going back on his word would discredit him among his military ranks.  Check The military is the only 'power' Musharraf has.  Check We have a Presidential election coming up.   Check  OK, all those points argue *against* the placing any kind of projectible force on the ground in Pakistan  IMVHO .  However, with that General (too lazy to re-look up his name) making calls like 'We'll have OBL before year end', and the assassination attempts as cover, maybe we already know where bin laden and his top lieutenants are.  We know we can't go in and full-on  get him  b/c of the tribal presences in that region, so who's to say we don't just send some Spec Ops guys in to scare a few AQ feebs who'll report back to 'the boss', get OBL thinkin the cavalry is right over the horizon and flush him out where we hit him with a MOAB or something.    Heh.  Sounds like that would be a classic play, and much more in sync with where military strategy (what I can make of it) is headed -  heavier reliance on psy- and spec-ops .  Guys like Rummy and Wolfowitz would just assume overthrow governments (or whatever) with as few troops/presence as possible (as we saw in Iraq - supply lines stretched thin, heavier reliance on SpecOp forces on the ground, etc.).  The cost (in lives, $$, morale) of moving large groups of troops around is burdensome, as we've also seen in Iraq 'aftermath'.    I simply cannot see our strategists making a dumb move like this.         ",0

"1620","2814357","Science","           I thought I would supply some background, so here goes.  I moved to DC in April 2004 to start a research post at NASA after completing my PhD at Queen's University Belfast. Although sorry I had to leave the wonderful city of Belfast, I was looking forward to starting a new life, and meeting new people. I found an apartment in Adams Morgan, sorted out furniture etc., and was soon settled in. It was actually quite easy to settle into my new life, as I knew I would be going back to Belfast for my graduation in June. Going back to Belfast was the best 3 weeks of my life. It was wonderful to be around so many familiar faces once more. But of course this meant that it was all the more difficult to leave.   Leaving Belfast on July 11 2004 was the hardest thing I have ever had to do. It was so much more final than last time. Sure, I see all my friends again, but it will never be the same. We'll never get back to the old days. I know this all sounds very soppy, and not very stiff upper lip British (I know I said I was Irish, but I'll get back to that one). But it has actually got me very depressed.   I'll soon get over this, I always do. But in the meantime, I'm going to post thoughts and stories about the past, and I hope then you'll understand why Belfast is such a special place, and why I find DC so strange.          ",0

I wonder how he does that, with that horrendous amount of homework thrown at him plus projects... Alright let's not beat about the bush, i admit that sometimes i can be jealous of him (positive side of jealousy, not negative side) and will treat him as my 'mo2 fan4', or model. Everyone who cannot manage time well enough, maybe you can consult him. Boy, i'm really amazed by how he manages his time, while everyone in Singapore often complaint with the modal answer, 'no time!'.   Father who was jailed  Yesterday's news, Father you-noe-who was jailed for 71/2 years for embezzlement of mllion of dollars in church fund. If I'm the judge (from what i understand, the judge is female), I would have sentence him to 20 years. Singapore laws doesn't really reflect much on embezzlement of religious groups. If it's embezzlement of money from a bank or something like that, it would have been much more than just 71/2 years. Still remember the guy from the beer company sentenced to life imprisonment? Stealing from a church should have been more severe than banks! Father Kang has betrayed the trust of the church-goers!    Moussaoui? Death Penalty?  US Supreme Court ruled that Moussaoui is most probably subjected to the death penalty. Moussaoui is suspected to be involved in the 911 attacks. Surprisingly, defense lawyers rebutted the court's decision as no fundamental rights and that he is not connected to Al-Qaeda in any way. Anyway, it's good enough that the death penalty talk in back in the table. However, certain district judges still rebutted of Moussaoui's constitutional right without a fair trial including video questioning with other county judges, besides the panal of 3 judges from the Supreme Court. The Grand Jury was also claimed 'inadaptable' for a serious case such as the Al-Qaeda. Meanwhile, Moussaoui confessed of being in league with Osama Bin Laden but not involved in 911. Still, i think the whatsoever constitutional rights should change in leauge that the court case can have a bigger scope of focus and also charge Moussaoui with being in league with Osama even if not involved in 911. If Moussaoui is released and reunited with Al-Qaeda, wouldn't that be a great disaster? My final 'decisions'? The Supreme Court is right for the death penalty and i'm fully behind it. Who knows how many other lifes will they take the next time? Electrocution is not enough for such people, their cruelty has caused hundereds and thousands of lifes! They should be sentenced straight to poison gas, or even maybe drowning! Moussaoui's case is scheduled to be continued on April 28 (day of preliminary of project's day).           ",0

"1653","2705696","indUnk","       Yesterday was fun. We went to Galesburg to our dinner group. We had much fun, but the pizza wasn't as good as expected. At least I should say I had much fun. Shawn apparently is not having  any  fun. I just read his blog.  I wanted to get the new Eddie Murphy movie yesterday so I asked for it. Granted I should have asked for the money before he went to work, but I didn't think of it. I kept asking him to take me to get it when he got home, but he wouldn't because he wanted to relax. Plus, He says that bills soak up all the money which I do understand. Which is also why I put them in my name, but he is also on the bills, so that if something doesn't get paid it goes on my credit and not his. He'll come away from not paying the bills free and clear, but I won't.  Next we move on to me wanting to see my family. What he doesn't get is I missed them. No one told me that if I moved down here then I would never see them again which is basically how it has been. I talked to them on the phone, but it is not the same. When I get a job, I am going to visit my family regardless of what Shawn says.  When I get a job, I will fend for myself. Apparently Shawn wants me to depend on him, but what he doesn't realize is that I wasn't raised that way. I can buy my own things and stuff.      ",0
"1654","2699874","Science","   Had a peaceful slumber for 3 hours. That was refreshing!! Now, i'm watching this program on TV, 'World Idol'. It's quite interesting. Why would anyone want to be a world idol and how does one become an idol anyway? Well, I guess they sing and they slug it out with horrible judges on the stage. I have an ordinary voice...I'm out of tune at times and I can't handle that kind of criticism. So, I guess I can never be an idol then? But I like the idol from Canada and Polland. They've got spunk! Well, I guess the key is standing out and making an impression.   Conversation about relationships  Had a conversation with a friend of mine about my relationship or my lack of it right now. I'm just so tired. It robs me off of my strength and happiness just thinking about it. I promised that it'll be my last time to talk about it. I'll give my emotions a rest for awhile. So, I won't be mentioning it in my blog anymore. Unless something nice happens. I'm still hoping things would turn out better.   Comment  ",0

Well, as Mike mentioned already, we went to see a run-through (final rehearsal) of Matt LeBlanc's 'Friends' spin-off, 'Joey'.  I must say, it was pretty funny.  He was cool, too.  He would gesture to the crowd everytime he would walk by to another scene.  When you watch him you can tell he feels like he has this huge burden on his shoulders to be accepted by 'Friends' fans without the chemistry that made the show so popular.  I would like to see the show succeed, being such a big 'Friends' fan myself, but I think most people are going to use the new show as a sort of 'Friends patch'.  Slowly weening themselves from the show that has been a part of their lives for the last ten years.  Once they have gotten their 'fix' and start looking at the show on it's own, they'll realize the balance that made 'Friends' what it was is missing.  'Friends' was an ensemble cast.  No one person made the show as endearing as it was.  You can call the new show an ensemble, but let's face facts:  people are tuning in to see Joey.  As much as you may like one of the other cast members, they're still going to be his supporting cast.  It's up to LeBlanc to carry the show.  The character is great, don't missunderstand, but too much of any good thing is still too much.  He needs an equal character to play off of and he just doesn't have it.  I hope I'm wrong.  The show that we saw, though...very funny.  It's supposed to kick off in September and I'm looking forward to it.  I guess we'll see what happens then.          ",0
"1658","2686258","Arts","        The Universe conspires to help us, even when it hurts.     Every thought of my day is consumed with producing my work.  Every aspiration I have is to make myself a better artist, and produce successful stories.  Unfortunately in the last 4 months, my follow-through has been stuck in the mud.  I continue to dream and plan as though I were still working as hard as I was just a few months ago, but dreams can only get you so far.  I believe that when you contract with the Universe to help you in achieving whatever dream it is you want to make real, the universe will conspire to help you do it, even if you find  yourself  unable to do it.  Well, lately, the Universe is kicking my ass back into gear.     A few weeks ago when the internet on my computer stopped working, I should have been paying attention.  Instead, I went out of my way to fix it, rather than fix what was REALLY the problem.  Last week, when the antenna on my TV broke so that I only had one channel to watch, I should have been paying attention.  It was the end of staying up till 5 in the morning zombifying to the Late night news.  I still didn't get it.  Then yesterday, my computer's hard-drive crashes... that was my wake up call.  I'm paying attention now.  I've lost everything.  My scripts, my journals, my art... everything.  Fortunately the few things I need right now, I still have within my reach.  And the only thing left for me to spend time doing is to draw.  Which is the only thing I should have been doing all of this time.  No more playing on the internet, chatting with friends or 'researching'.  So chalk it up to fate.    I should have been listening more carefully.   I'm back to work now.  I went to Denny's and drew all night.  I got a dozen or so character sketches done for the proposal.  Now I just need a few dozen more and to finish some actual sequential art and I'll finally have a complete project to send in.  At least I'm more confident that I'm on the right track now.  If the Universe is going to go this far to keep me on task, then I must be doing something right.  Lets just hope something comes to fruition with this story proposal now.   -Will        ",0

Listening to the sound of my dogs running through the house, tags jingling and tails wagging.  Tap dancing on my wooden floors.)  God, I was in such a rotten mood earlier.  I wanted to scream for about ten minutes, kick a couple pillows and cry for an eternity.  Then, I remembered Sparky.  Like I could ever possibly forget?  I will always and forever think of this house as The House That Sparky Built.  Granted, it was around for 41 years before my Sparky was, it's still The House That Sparky Built.  I'll tell you why.  After my (oh my GOD!) SECOND divorce at the tender age of 27, I struck out on my own for the first time.  The years between 27 and 30 were rocky, scary, terrifying at times, but I managed to survive.  And enjoy it.  I hated the feeling of being 'tied down.'  So I did the wise thing and moved in with my newest boyfriend not even a year later.  Doomed is a word you can use.  JEB, it wasn't you, it wasn't me, it was the TIMING.  After that, FUCK RELATIONSHIPS, I said.  I had the best times and the worst times and often wondered when it would all slow down and I could B R E A T H E again.  Inhale, baby, because you're gonna need some oxygen:  December 1998 - Sparky was born; I was in sick relationship with K, who looked like The Hobbit (don't ask). March 1999 - I broke up with The Hobbit and needed something to nurture. April 1999 - Went to pick up the love of my life, my little man, that little shit! Sparky. January 2000 - Was almost certifiably suicidal; leaving Spark was the only thing that stopped me. February 2000 - Bought first home, mainly because I thought the idea of a backyard would be a GOOD thing. May 2000 - Meet Vicente/Move into FIRST HOME. December 2000 - Decide we are exclusive (me and Vicente, not me and my dog) January 2001 - Sparky comes close to losing his life to Addison's Disease - I spend astronomical amounts of money on his 'cure' - only to find there is none, only a treatment; begin countdown to June 17, 2003 March 2001 - V comes as close as he ever did to telling me he loves me (if that's possible) August 2002 - Sparky is pre-diagnosed with Lymphoma, only to turn out to be a really bad infection Thanksgiving 2002 - 'Rescued' Sadie, sister and playmate for Sparky - they love each other immediately! February 2003 - 'Momma' comes close to talk of permanent brain damage from infection; Sparky sleeps with Momma non-stop for two week recovery period; Sparky doesn't care that Momma's neck is the size of a mutant football. April 2003 - More seizures, Jesus, will he  ever  get better??? May 2003 - Adopt Buzzy, who just seemed to be 'right' for my home June 17, 2003 - Sparky lost life-long fight against weakened body, bad genes and shitty luck.  I would have given him one of  my  kidneys, had it fit.  I can survive a lot of things:  divorce (2), death (not that many, and I still have my parents), disappointment (who hasn't??), bankruptcy, illness, chronic pain, loss that is unmitigated to those of us who lead more blessed lives.  The one thing that threw a wrench in all of it, all the strength, all the toughness, all the wisdom and cliches and yeah-I-know-it's-all-for-the-best is this:  what the hell do you do when you lose your soulmate?  Be it a dog, a boy, your son, your mom, a friend, some words, a smile, true love...it hurts the same way for all of us.  It's more fun this way...C 2004 nongirlfriend.com               ",0

"1665","2667502","indUnk","             I realized today that I am blessed with a special brain.  I remember things.  Not that I don't need to study, because I do, but once something is ingrained in my brain, there it shall stay until the end of time.  In grade 8 we had to learn the poem 'In Flander's Fields', and we had to present it, with emotion in our voices, different inflections at different points.  I still remember every last word and tone of voice.    We got our comprehensive exams back today.  They covered a little bit of everything that we have learned in the last 2 years.  Between the 2 exams they were approximately 300 multiple choice (and a few matching) questions.  I got 90% on my academic one (including anatomy, physiology, pathology, nutrition and kinesiology) and 91% on the practical portion (including massage treatments, contraindications, assessments, remedial exercise and business/ethics).  I barely cracked a book for either of them, but I believe that they showed me that I remember a lot of stuff from the last 2 years.  This is a good thing since I have my board exams later this week (Thursday at 1-5pm and Saturday 8-10am).  But I looked around at other people who got much lower marks than me, and I am not bad mouthing them in any way, but I just don't feel that smart....like I said before, I think I was blessed with a very special brain.  On another note, my grad was yesterday.  It was fun to get dressed up, however the grad was really long and boring.  We actually left part way through...after the meal because my family and Jay were bored, I was bored and mom had the beginnings of the flu.  So we took off early and didn't miss anything but a REALLY boring guest speaker and special awards that I didn't win!  I am getting excited about being done!  And on Saturday I got flowers delivered to my house, from Jay's parents, that was super nice!!  We only have 5 more days that we have to go to school!!

As I went into a local dairy queen today (actually its not very local, its about 15 driving minutes away), I saw on one of them little stand up signs advertising something called cake on a stick.  I figured why couldnt they actually come up with a good name for it?  Like a 3D Dilly bar?  Or cake pop?  But nooooooooo they called it cake on a stick, the most unoriginal name ever.  So what do I do? I bought one naturally, what doesnt taste better on a stick?  When I received this supposed cake on a stick I was gravely disappointed, not only was I about twice the price of a Dilly bar, but it was about half the size too.  This was an outrage; there was a seriously low ice cream to money ratio here.  Not only that but after a few minutes the ice cream melted enough that the whole cake on a stick fell off, I ate it anyway but its just not the same when its not on a stick.  But anyway, that was just one of my many adventures to come.  Stay tuned for Living the Wal-mart life but thats only if I get the job. -Matt    ",0

"1674","2630214","indUnk","           As you enter into conversations with people, try and pay attention to their body language, even more than what they actually say. Almost everyone, whether they like to admit or not, wants to be noticed and will subliminally try to garner your attention. I do it all the time, much more often than I like to admit. It's not wrong to want to be heard, though. People cast out signals about how they are feeling constantly, and our smarter/more perceptive friends catch them immediately. My question is this: Why do we try and hide what's going on in the first place? Are we really that naive to think that God doesn't know how messed up we are? There's a God with a direct line open just for you, every time of day. Sure, your friends will tell you, 'You can call me anytime, I'm always here for you.' You know, I haven't met one person who has been able to live up to that promise. It's an overused cliche, and one that I'm just tired of hearing. Still, we buy into it with all of our heart and when that person's not around, we're crushed. I personally have hit some rough sailing, and haven't had too many people to talk to about it, since everyone has been gone. The main thing is that I'm no longer a close friend of a person who I put so much stock in. I don't know what the deal is; they have been gone a lot, and when they've been here they've mainly been around one person. Maybe things have just been hectic; maybe I'm not what I used to be in their eyes...but why should I let that affect how I view myself or how the rest of my life is going? Once again, He's always there.....and it's not like you have to have your thoughts organized. Dump it all at His feet and you'll be surprised at how organized (and ultimately, insignificant) it comes out to be. And just because things are rough between you and someone who once was close, don't take it as a sign that things are over.  'A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.' -Proverbs 17:17~  Of course, if this person has no desire to lend you assistance when you're weak, then why attempt to make them? Some people are so wrapped up in their own situation that they constantly remain clueless as to what you're going through. Forget them before you try too hard and get too involved. IT IS NOT WORTH IT! no matter how strongly you feel about the person. Above all, hold no friendship above the one you have acquired with God. He treasures it more than anything else; He has His own Son's blood shed to spend the rest of time with you. You don't even have to pay a fraction of the price He did, and He doesn't have the human knack for letting people down. Let go and let God!         ",0
"1675","2628114","Technology","           After an excruciatingly hot birthday run on Saturday, I set out with Brad on a post birthday dinner run on Sunday night.  The temperature was much better even though the humidity was not.  Everything in my body was telling me to not go running, but to drive home and sleep.  The run was setting up to be another unenjoyable after-meal run where I was tired and cramping up.  I sucked it up anyway and took off with Brad.  A storm just happened to rolling in at that time so for most of the run, we had a spectacular light show from the approaching lightning.  Since the storm was coming, it helped to bring the temperature down which made running quite enjoyable.  I didn't experience any pain or discomfort like I thought I would and actually felt downright good on the run.  All the joints and muscles and ligaments and sinews felt pretty good.  The slight discomfort in my knees was still present in some of the later inclines but the pain, in general, seems to be receding.  Truly the best part of the run, though, was easily the last 5 minutes.  Sprinkles of rain began to fall about a mile out which didn't bother me one bit since it was still pretty hot.  The rain increased and we increased our pace along with it.  By the time we reached H&B's house, it was downright pouring and we were flying.  I didn't care about getting soaked for a brief minute.  It was absolutely spectacular to run through the torrential rain and lightning and thunder.  It was almost surreal for about 12 seconds before we reached the door.  I can't wait for more summer storms in which to run.  For those in Cincinnati, if you see the sky clouding up or a storm rolling in, don't be surprised to think that I may be lacing up my running shoes to go and enjoy a run in it.    I get back to my mid-week runs tonight with 3 4-mile runs in a row.  I have decided that the NYC plan I was going to follow has just too many miles for the long runs.  I am not running to break any records or beat any personal bests (it's a little hard to have personal bests when you haven't even been running a year).  The NYC is the marathon that inspired me to start running and I am going to enjoy it with Brad no matter if we run a 7 hour marathon.  With all of that said, I am scaling back my long runs by two miles which doesn't mean much to any of you, but it means a tremendous amount to me with regard to wear and tear and time on the road.

"1677","2623288","Consulting","       The  urlLink Pontiff has warned American bishops  that American life is in danger of becoming soulless.  I would say we are already there, most people's lives are soulless, despite all of the supposed soul-searching that goes on when Americans consume self-help books.  The Pope makes a much-needed critique of America's obsession with materialism.  Of course, I don't agree with the Catholic Church and I think the quicker it dies off or changes the better.  Nonetheless, the Pope is right about the big picture.  It's not very pretty.  However, what we don't need is Catholic dogma to replace the materialistic market fundamentalism that dominates America's consciousness.  What's needed is a awakening of the mind, a cultural transformation.  One componetn of this change is the emergence of critical mindset in more people.  The critical disposition is one of the things that made the thoughts of philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle so essential to the development of individual freedom in Western civilization.  Thanks to the mindlessness of market fundamentalism our society no longer seriously honors the skeptical or critical mindset.  Instead there is a tremendous emphasis on blind faith, whether that faith is in Jesus, the New Age, or the stock market.  To me this indicates a fundamental psychological breakdown in many people's ability to cope with complex social/political reasoning.  A large part of this psychological breakdown involves socioeconomic anxiety about not achieving a particular 'status level.'  It would be interesting to see psychological research studies applied to the contemporary American political psyche in a way that might shed light on why so many people refuse to think clearly about society, culture, and politics (BTW, this foggy thinking is evidenced on both the Right and Left).

I cried during Laurel's speach, I couldn't believe how sad it was. Felicia and I were close to tears the whole time. I cried afterwards, someone I like so much came up and gave me a hug and as soon as we walked away I started crying! Today I cried too. Jennifer and I were talking about how pretty soon we were going to be up there getting our diploma's and being done with high school, and how we will never have the same group of people in this school ever again. My friends are the world to me right now. I don't know what I would do without them. It's even worth the stupid gossip that goes around our school. I don't care anymore, I have realized that people will say what they want to say and I shouldn't care about it because even if it's not true it's going to be said eitherways. We were trying to have a bonfire today although I didn't even try to go... I'll just have to call them and tell them that I won't be out there, they can go if they want to.  I think I want to go to ASU. I love Arizona... but I also love Maine... I don't know where I am going to go, but I can garentee that it will be one of those two places. I am not even going to think about it until I am a junior, I mean hell, I have 3 years to worry about this. I am going to stop stressing the small stuff! :) CARPE DIEM! Sieze the day... for tomorrow we die! Ciao               ",0

Date: Thu 07/25/02 10:35 PM    http://www.rehermorrison.com/techTalk/08.htm   Thought you might like that.... was searching for some stuff and  stumbled onto it!   Here's the whole index to the articles:  http://www.rehermorrison.com/techTalk/indexStart.htm   That should keep you busy for a while if you get bored ;-)   Talk to you soon!   *kiss*   Dennis   PS-For Larry...   This is a copy/paste of a post I made on a list tonight about why big  cams don't work and how to use them right in turbo 2.2/2.5's....   'If you are reading this and have never sat down and tried to figure out   your compression ratio mathematically, you will be confused about what  I'm saying below. This is pretty advanced stuff. Read a book that tells  you how to figure your compression ratio if you are interested in  learning this.   If you have microsoft Excel, you can download a bunch of formulas  including a compression ratio calc I wrote into a spreadsheet by simply  clicking this link: http://www.fwdmopar.com/sites/dennis/math.xls   The first reason that most large camshafts do not work in our cars is  because the static compression ratio is too low, which kills the dynamic   compression ratio when the intake valve closes later.   Almost everyone is afraid to raise the static compression ratio for fear   of breaking something.   Lets say a stock 2.5T1 has 145psi cranking compression... now stick a  S60 in and the cranking compression drops to about 120psi.   Imagine if you raised the static compression ratio enough so that the  cranking compression w/the S60 cam was 145psi again...   This is what you'd need to do to make the big cams work, among other  things.   There is a formula for calculating how much to raise the compression  ratio in order to account for a longer duration camshaft. This formula  is complex, but what it basically does is use the *trapped volume* of  intake charge as your *volume at BDC* figure instead of BDC. Trapped  volume is basically anything that happens after the intake closes while  the piston is on the compression stroke. When it closes, call that point   BDC and use the volume in the cylinder at that moment as your figure  when figuring *dynamic* compression ratio.   So, in effect, we could figure the dynamic CR of a stock 7.8:1 2.5T1  w/an 89TBI roller (intake closes @56deg ABDC). Then figure out how much  to raise the compression ratio in order to use a longer duration  camshaft.   Ok, let the math begin! I have another REALLY HUGE Excel spreadsheet I'm   working on to answer this, but it might be easier and more accurate to  simply mock the engine up and measure the remainder of the stroke left  when the intakve valve rests on the seat.   Variables like rod ratio, piston pin offset, and actual valvetrain  geometry could throw this formula off quite a bit I think.   Oh, and another thing to think about before you get too excited....  bigger cams move the powerband higher.... not usually the best thing to  do if your cylinder head looks like it was designed by Briggs and  Stratton!'

"1681","2611645","indUnk","             Just celebrated the belated birthday of a friend last Saturday. Rico was a guy who said that he's now at the same age as the Messiah about a day before Saturday. He requested the company of the high school friends circle of me, Vic and Rem. Though Steve was very scarce these days with no new news on him. It was an afternoon to late evening of food, softdrink and talking of stuff.  Vic and Rem were talking a lot of the high-school hijinks that range from the use water-filled paper balloons, paper bullets propelled by rubber bands, the so-called 'Flying T', toy parachutes and stories of petty shop-lifting and other foolishness. High school and grade school stuff really harkens the most obvious truth as to the difference between us and the later generations, entertainment and reasons for fun were simpler and harmless. Lessons were learned as well as the memories.  High and grade school stuff with some occasional post college happening talk seems to point out an obvious thing, our generation to say back then is more into clean fun than the obvious vices and attitudes we now hear and know on media. Technology was also an issue that affected how young people go about their lives and having fun. Email and Texting has become so abused in the manner of how it affects communication between people and tosses out courtesy and manners. That last bit I discovered all too well from reading someone else's blog.  It was also of note in our discussion for that day was about the common thread that got the group together, it was the lure and promise of a session of playing Dungeons & Dragons. Back then, the range of games available was limited and not catering to exploring mature themes. Nowadays there's a slew of Role Playing Games and related material which cover a lot more stuff. Magic The Gathering was pretty much considered to be an addiction of sorts on introduction here in the late 1990's along with the speculation market spurred in the area of collecting, whether it be basketball cards, toys or comics.  Some values we were accustomed to growing up having been superseded by hype and commercialization as if orchestrated by some grand plan of social engineering dictated for the coming generations to be impressed on. All presentation in media seems to validate what ever this social engineering plan calls for.  It would seem to fall more on parents more than ever to nurture and guide their children into the right kind of people, in spite what can be said otherwise by the currently dictated cultural and generational programming dictated by this ever-changing society.  I will post something next time in the arena of superheroes and current comic book culture which has some sensibility ties to this post. Next time.          ",0

"1684","2607577","Religion","                 Hello again!! I just got back from the chapel at work.  On my break I go down there and pray!  Its really nice and quiet especially at night. I was thinking back to when I was a kid and even a teenager. I remember that I was one of those kids who were always wondering about the other kids and why they would act they way they do.  I could always go past the service and knew that there was a reason. Even if I did not understand but I knew it was there. I have always had a big heart.  I have always had a lot of love I have wanted to share but really usually loved the wrong people for the wrong reasons.  Now ever since I have been saved my love has grown so much as well.  I have been getting to the point that my chest just wants to burst.  Sometimes I have a hard time expressing that love to people and I can go to one extreme to the next.  God lead me to some scripture tonight in Romans 12 and 13.  I don't want to type out the whole thing because it would be way to long.  There are some that I would like to share.  Like Romans 12:9-13 Love must be sincere. Hate what is evil: cling to what is good.  Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.  Honor one another ABOVE yourselves. Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer.  Share with God's people who are in need. Practice hospitality.  God is so awesome and I want everyone to know him.  I want to know him so more deeply than what I do. I so want to do the things he mentions because it will honor his name.  I want to be the friend, wife, mother, leader that really HONORS other people above myself.  I want all that is in the above scriptures. So for those who want to know me and know my heart.  There it is.... it just wants to love all people saved and unsaved.  I want to find the lost and show them that there is someone out there that wants to protect them and love them.  I want so much to walk in LOVE at all times. I desire to be used by God in whatever way he wants.  I have so much to learn and I know I cannot do anything without him. So know that anything I say anything I do..when I breath, when I sleep, when I talk, and when I LOVE its all him. ITS ALL GOD!! I wouldn't want it any other way.               ",0

"1691","2586414","Government","       Well today is the last day I will be at my parentsâ€™ house for quite some time. I am undecided as to when I will be coming back here again. I was thinking I should come up for Christmas- as I have been given that week off work as holiday leave. However, I think it would be way too hot for me to come up at that time of year- in the middle of summer. It was even a bit hot for me to come up this time around- and it is the end of Autumn/beginning of winter! Oh well I will decide something sooner or later. The other option is to come up next August. My partner however in the meantime wants us to go to Bali for a week or so, or somewhere else overseas.   The prices for an overseas holiday are comparable to that of a domestic holiday, so going to either destination is not a problem financially. Perhaps I will go to both- that is, go overseas, and then come up to see my parents in August. I was kind of planning on going somewhere during December anyway in Victoria- provided it is nice and warm- or even to Tasmania. I discovered a tourist brochure for the Spirit of Tasmania, and they were offering 7day holidays, including travel (in which you can take your car for free!) for just over $100. That is an absolute bargain! I will definitely have to go there one of these days as well.   Before that as well, I also have the week of the Melbourne Cup and the Spring Racing Carnival off as holiday leave as well. I am not sure if I will go to the races, or go somewhere in Victoria either. We will see how we go with that. Another factor in all of this as well is that I have an outstanding tax office debt of around $7000- so weâ€™ll see how much they demand to take from my salary each fortnight before I make any further plans about holidays and all that.  Anyway, today I got up at 6:30- and it was nice and sunny again. And as my first day up here, the first thing I felt when I got up was a nice warm breeze blowing over me. I will certainly miss that when I get to Victoria. We never get nice, warm moist winds down thereâ€¦. Only hot and dry.  I got to the bus stop just before 10am. We got there by taxi. There is something to be said for the lack of hygiene amongst taxi drivers in general (well the ones that I have encountered anyway!), but this one- oh my godâ€¦. Letâ€™s just say I was glad to get out of the cab! Anyway at the bus stop I thought I saw someone I went to school with. I did not say hello though. I am a bit silly about things like that. If I am not 100% sure that someone is who I think they are- I will not go up to them at all- for fear of getting it wrong and making a complete idiot of myself. Anyway next time I am up there I will go around town and make sure I say hello. By the way, I am still not 100% sure who that girl was that was talking to me in the shops the other day!  The bus came early, and we got on. I do not mind long bus trips like this, but my mother seems to. We pulled into Airlie Beach and picked up some passengers. It was really nice there- and I was looking at the tourists everywhere along the street. I think it would be cool to just get away by myself for a holiday one of these days. I do not think it would happen though. I would not be able to stay away from my partner for too long (missable!) and I could not come up here for a trip by myself anyway- as my family would want me to come up and visit them as well (and I would want to stay there as well- hey free accommodation!) ïŠ  After that, we continued our journey south. I read a book that mum had given- Crossing Over by John Edward. It was an interesting read- however I found it to be very similar to watching the television show in parts. I actually do believe in the things he writes about. Call me crazy, but sometimes I do feel as though the presence of those departed are around me. Also, at funerals- I never feel upset. I usually (well ALWAYS) get the feeling that the spirit of the deceased is around me, and that they are very much happier where they are. So I am the one trying to hide my smile when everyone else is upset. I do feel it is inappropriate that I feel strangely happy at funerals for those that die- but the way I see it- they are no longer suffering on earth anymore, and they are much happier where they are now. I donâ€™t think many people understand the way I think about these things- and I know I have offended many as well. But hey- each to their own- I respect the thoughts of others on this matter, and thankfully, most respect mine as well.  Back to the bus trip! We stopped for lunch at some place called Koumala. I wondered if this was some sort of Greek name or is this meant something naughty in another languageâ€¦ probably not I imaginedâ€¦ Koumala is really just a roadhouse with really expensive food in it. I ended up just getting some more lollies to eat. I was not going to pay excessive amounts of money for something that was likely to taste crap.  Back on the bus again, and we passed through some more really really small towns. The landscape did not change much once we passed through Sarina and left the sugar cane country. Near sunset I looked out the window and saw a couple of wild kangaroos. Some of the backpackers on the bus were a bit excited about that!  Then finally, at about 6:15, we pulled into Rockhampton. It was still really warm there, probably mid 20â€™s. I went to get some milk from Doblos- a local independent retailer. I had wanted to go there because during summer, I saw on  a current affairs show (Today Tonight) that they were offering fuel vouchers (save 10c off per litre) to anyone who bought over $30 worth of goods from their stores. It made the news show because the local Safeway (locally known as Woolworths here) was matching it. (Everywhere else in Australia the discount is 4c per litre). Anyway I was disappointed to learn that the discount here was now only 6cper litre, and only able to be used at local petrol stations. Oh well, next time.  From there we went and visited one of my cousins and had dinner. I donâ€™t know what it is about Queenslanders- but they seem to make interesting interpretations of all sorts of food. This time it was Lemon Chicken, but not how I am used to it in Melbourne. The lemon sauce here seemed to be creamy in texture and looks, and taste. This was something a bit unusual for me, as I am used to the lemon sauce being transparent, and a yellow colour. The rice was much starchier than I am used to as well. I should not bitch about this though, as I used to make food like this as well while I was still living up here. Anyway, because I was so hungry, I had 2 servings.   After that, it was off to my grandparents (otherwise known as â€˜the farmâ€™.) I suppose I cannot really call it my grandparents, as my grandfather (on mothers side of the family) died over 7 years ago, and my grandmother lives here with 4 of her sons (my uncles)- who have never permanently moved away (that I am aware of at least!). So I think I will just call it the farm from now onwards.   On the way out, I was absolutely amazed by all the stars I could see in the sky. I had thought I could see a lot of stars from the Western suburbs- but it is nothing compared to what you can see from this part of the world. There was no moon in the sky at all, yet the sky seemed to have a whitish tinge to it- not absolutely black. I could clearly see the milky way- beautiful in its appearance. I thought I could even see the comet that is visiting our skies at the moment! By the time we reached the farm though (just after 10:30pm), I did not wish to go sky gazing anymore. I just wanted to go to bed.   I went straight to bed- without even having a shower or washing my hair. I never do this, especially when my hair has freeze gel through it (and has had it in there all day!) But I was just too tired. Just after 11pm- I closed my eyes and went to sleep.          ",0

"1706","2547304","indUnk","              I just got back from HELL!!!   During lunch today, I went over to the gas station to have my cracked headlight replaced.  It took about 15 minutes for them do.  I was going to get gas as well since my gas light was on, but it was $2.20/gallon.  So, I decide that I would drive up toward White Oak for cheaper gas.  I found the place and was just about to take a U-turn when the car started slowing down.  I was actually running out of gas.  I was able to get into the left turn and then nothing.  The car wouldn't even roll, except for a little bit backwards.  If this had happened a few years ago I would have freaked out, but I have been through so much with this car that its old news when something happens to me.  (I will tell you tomorrow about the time my car almost blew up.)    So, I called AAA and asked them to send someone over with gas.  They told me that they would put it as a priority call since I was in the middle of an intersection and I was on my lunch break. The time was 2:15 and they said that someone would be there by 3:30, 4:00 at the latest.  Then I called Gwyneth at the office and told her of my troubles.  She always understands my stupidity and that's why it sucks that tomorrow is her last day.  It was freaking hot in the car, I haven't been sweating for a few days and it felt like a sauna in the car and I couldn't run the airconditioning because it would wear out the battery and I couldn't open the windows becuz there tons of cicadas flying around and I already had the excitement of a cicada in the car for today.  So I sat in the boiling hot car with no gas and bugs flying all around.  I think that this is what hell will be like.  Sweaty and full of bugs.  So I called Liz and told her I was in hell and that I was stupid and she suggested that I call Mike, so I did and he attempted to come and help me, but he couldn't find my car, but it was okay because AAA had just called to say that it would only be another 20 minutes.    People are stupid (besides me and my problems.)  I had my hazard lights on, but people still came right into the turn lane and came right up to the back of my car and then started honking even after I waved them around.  Don't honk at me I cannot go anywhere get over and stop giving me dirty looks.  This went on for over an hour.  Finally, the AAA, who had a University of Maryland Facilities shirt on, arrived and filled up the gas and I tried to start the car, but the fucking battery was dead becuz I was running the hazards the whole time.  So he gave me a jump start, I gave him the $5 for the gas and I was on my way.  I finally got back to the office around 4:00.  I took a pointless sweaty 3 hour lunch break.  Sometimes I don't know why I do the things that I do.  They are so illogical.  Normally I don't care how much gas costs I just get it cuz I need it.  I have never run out of gas before.  Why today did I decide to drive out of the way to get gas?  I will never understand.  Am I subconsciously testing my own boundaries?           ",0

I was watching the idols last night and I felt so huge compared to how they looked. I am trying to lose weight but no i've been gaining muscle so the number on the scale has gone up a few pounds. I know tht muscle good, fat bad and the scale doesn't mean anything but I feel like it does. Going home this weekend. I called Jenni to tell her. I want to call Ashley to see if she wants to go out but i don't have any money so I know I can't. I miss hanging out with everyone sometimes. But i do know that I'm pretty much over it. My life there is slowly fading - and I'm kinda glad i'm losing interest. It was in a way holding me back. The guilt of leaving friends and such. but i know i don't belong there. So it goes. re-reading my fav stranger in a strange land (obviously the namesake for this blog) and i forgot how much i REALLY love that book. It's just so awesome and astounding. I've decided to re-read some of my favs this month and next month - i think I'm going to do the Electric Kool-Aid Acid test, then maybe brave new world again. i probably should get cracking on some of the books julie gave me - i re-read a wrinkly in time and tried the Claiming of Sleeping beauty which was awesome.

I can take pictures of students around the  UP Sunken Garden  and the soccer players in the field.  I can take pictures of those  Atenistas  and  LaSallistas  playing  American Football  at the  Sports Oval .

That you don't have to have the drama surrounding things in your life to enjoy them (this I knew already, but wanted to reiterate that for those of you 'dramatic' people who think EVERYONE has to be in on every detail.)

"1729","2448893","Education","           Last Saturday, I was able to watch three plays in Ateneo with two of my closest friends, Justin and Wendell.  We were lucky that we were invited by our friend Lex to watch 'Bahay-Bahayan'. BTW, Lex is from Ateneo.  He's a part of the Entablado.  All of the plays were great, and had wide-ranging themes and topics.  The performers carried out their actions and words well.   Last week(if i'm not mistaken), the ACET results were released.  Both Wendell and Justin passed it and also got their first choice courses.  Definitely, I was glad for them.  But then, Wendell told me that he wouldn't be going to UP anymore because his parents want him to be in Ateneo, and also, he already assumes that he won't pass the UPCAT.  I disagreed with him, saying that the ACET was a lot harder compared to the UPCAT.  Then he told me that (he learned from a very reliable source) only 3 students from their batch passed the UPCAT.  Again I argued that even if only 3 passed from the UPCAT, that doesn't mean that he didn't pass it.  Well...maybe I just want him to be my schoolmate.  Justin on the other hand, definetely wants to go to UP.  I'm praying that he would also pass the entrance test so that both of us would be in Diliman.    Sana lahat na lang kami sa Diliman...

"1730","2447679","Non-Profit","           Ok, now for the developments from SB and EX.  Well, EX appeared in our former community last week, where we still jointly own a home.  Which was fine.  I took it as a sign he wanted to get away from SB, and going to the tiny outport of Grand Bruit would be a great way to do that.  He opened up the house again, and settled in.   THEN she showed up last night.  I had already had a discussion about that SB being in my house again, after I found out about her current criminal record and charges.  I was quite clear, actually...now that SB is in my house, sleeping in MY BED!!!  Now, I don't have a problem with EX finding true love again, but not with this particular conniving wench.  She is a convicted fraud queen, and has been nothing but a manipulator since he met her.  All I know is she better not get any ideas about what to do with MY house.   I know it is technically OUR house, which is fine, and its not even about the green monster of jealousy...GAWD NO.  It is about her getting her claws into my house, and doing something to it.    So the EX has also decided to smoke in the house.  I have a no-smoking sign posted there and it has been up for many years.  I gave up most of my vacation last summer (10 days) to paint almost the entire house and now he is stinking it up with his dirty cigarette smoke.  That will be ANOTHER conversation.    From all reports, SB showing up in Grand Bruit was a surprise to EX, so hopefully he packs her back on the boat again this morning and sends her back to where she came from.  If she stays, I can't believe he can be so stupid.  She is obviously POISON to him and he should cut her out of his life like the disease that she is.  Ok...enough ranting...that SB has already taken up too much of my thoughts for the day and to use the words of a fellow blogger, the  urlLink hairy hoser  I'm all about the love...so lets get back to that...

"1742","2427534","indUnk","             Atsui=hot.  Matsui=festival.  You can complete the connection.  There was a festival in Yonago this past weekend.  Itâ€™s actually called Gaina Matsui, which translates into Bad Boy Festival.  Why â€œBad Boyâ€ I have no idea.  Your guess is as good as mine.  Woke up at 10am, shit-shave-showered and then called Amy: weâ€™re meeting at the usual spot near the barbershop at Ekimae (area in front of the station) around 1:15.  Decided to do a little bit exploring myself so I left early for a little bit biking.  Ran into another JET group--Adam, Pam, and Manjinder--near the city hall.  Mori(sp)-san, the supervisor to these three, was an employee of the city government and knew about this pre-festival kick-off for the city hall employees.     When we got there, the pre-party was already under way.  People took turn shouting into the loud speaker, to the people waiting their turn (at the loud speaker) and anyone who cared to listen (which was everybody), who Hai's and Yoshi's at the top of their Lung's.  It was just an awesome atmosphere of people getting wasted,  in public, and in front of their co-workers and supervisors.  You can tell the hierarchy of the city hall just by standing there: the lower ranking workers (mostly younger-looking) were standing around and cheering and shouting without abandon, while the supervisors were sitting down and laying back in the lawn chairs, knocking back sake and spitting watermelon seeds.  And of course, the women were standing behind all of this, looking pretty and grinning in their yukata (summer version of kimono, traditional Japanese dress that makes women look like candy-wrapped presents).  And just as any top-down hierarchical despotic political systems in human history, revolution is inevitable...     Water from a sake keg (I'm guessing that not even the Japanese are crazy enough to splash sake so liberally) were dispensed with impunity on victims who were literally dragged out of the crowd.  Some were dismissed with just a few splashes, some were grabbed by the collar and dunked into the keg (a big, ~20L bucket would be a better description), and some were forced to their knees and choked on pouring beer/sake.  Pandemonium!  Unfortunately, with the shutter delay that plagues most digital cameras on the market, I was unable to capture these Kodak moments.  I did get a under-exposed picture of myself dueling with whom I thought to be the MC of the event:    (I'm so proud of this picture, under-exposed or not)  After this, we headed towards the Yonago City Cultural Exchange Center, 2 blocks away.  At this point, with the compounded effect of      This 'cultural exchange' event turned out to be just another typical sip-and-meet.  I was unable to get into the flow, having made up my mind about drinking a minimal amount of alcohol.  Talked, correction:listened, a good deal with Kathrine, who had many helpful advices on how to choose and participate in Japanese junior high school clubs.  Talked briefly with Ted, who sympathized with my late night.  Courtney repeatedly commented on my lethargic status and tried to chipper me up.  Talked with Shinji Matsubara, head of the insurance division of city hall (whose name I only remembered because I ran into him at city hall today), who spoke excellent English, good enough to offer me genuine insights on how the TC movie Last Samurai was received and perceived by the Japanese public.  Apparently, they really appreciated Hollywood for making an effort to demonstrate the aspects of Japanese culture and philosophy that are superior to their Western counterparts, even though the said demonstration had to be carried out by Tom Cruise, an idealized version of your common-variety whitey, in the movie.  Also spoke with a group of Chinese co-workers from Da-Shi (I'm guessing that it is written big-creek, somewhere near Beijing) that came to Japan to learn something about hard drive motors, and another Malaysian guy who came to Japan for the similar reason of learning CD-ROM motors.  Spoke Mandarin the whole time, which surely impressed the hell out of anyone who paid attention (only Ted commented on it though) to my 2.05-lingualism (.95 short of tri-lingualism).       Blah blah blah blah and we learned our dance moves for the parade--yes, we had a spot in the parade for Yonaga Gaina Festival down main street!  Rounds of rock paper scissors determined that I was one of the two carrying the banner, an atrocity of an idea in the typhoon wind.     The wind was so strong, my pole broke in half, twice.  After that I didn't even make an effort to stretch out the banner so much and just slacked it using my collarbone as the, uh, uh, middle point (can't remember the term)--even then my collarbone still ended up bruised the next day.  It was hard work, much harder than anyone behind me was doing banging away on their hacked-up Japanese dance steps.  I was so pissed about the whole thing, and only Corinne and Tyler offered any semblance of sympathy.    But these guys showed up:     Who basically drove in front of us to block the wind.  These guys rock!  Considering that the DUI percent in Japan is 0%, just imagine the sacrifices the driver made!  The tension started to build, and I started to forget about the pain against my neck and collarbone, we're next in line!     And then we danced and banged drums and carried the banner against the wind for 9 blocks     with audiences!     As in the norm, hard work in groups somehow always end up being rewarded by nothing more than a group photo.     More to come for that night's activities.  Must go now.           ",0

"1744","2425604","Student","       Daily Horoscope   Weekend Update: Friday is busy and may feel kind of thrown together, no matter how organized you try to be. Donâ€™t expect things to neatly fall into place â€“ and forget about sticking to a sensible schedule or routine. Last minute changes, including cancellations, may occur. Just brace yourself and remain philosophical. Keep in mind that any upcoming change is probably a good thing. Saturday begins with a set of expectations that may be tough to live up to. Donâ€™t box yourself or others into an impossible corner. If youâ€™re counting on others to behave a certain way or do a certain thing, you may be disappointed. Itâ€™s best to just clear your mind and let things happen as they will. Give up pointless control fantasies and try to live in harmony with your surroundings. Minimize stress and noise every chance you get because your nerves are already pretty raw. Saturday night is your reward â€“ pleasing and very enjoyable. Sunday has even more to offer, especially if youâ€™re creative.

"1748","2414493","Student","             I just woke up. This is bad. If I were in school right now, I'd be in the middle of fifth period, or journalism. Wow, I guess I was really that tired last night.  I kept on having weird dreams. Let's just say that I hope that nothing in my dreams last night ever happens in real life.  I'm still kind of dazed. It's that time in the morning when you know everyone back home is going to sleep until 11:30 too, so you can't expect them online.  Today's my meeting with Beth. Jenn and I both agree that it scares us, walking in to talk to her about our theses...I don't understand that feeling of dread, but it happens. As soon as I brush my teeth, etc. and get some normal clothes on it's going to be work out a thesis time. Well, I guess I already have one, kind of, but I don't know if it's good enough.  Isn't that what life is like? 'I don't know what's good enough.'  It's cloudy today.  I figured out yesterday at ABP that I could count the days left directly by knowing what day of the month it was. It didn't occur to me that at three weeks left, August started. So today's the sixth. I have about 15 days until SSP is over. Wow. And then a few more days on top of that until I actually am in sunny, wonderful California again.  It's not that I'm homesick, really. It'll just be nice being done with all the papers and work and all. And I'll still see Charlie and Jenn around, so no sweat...  Yeah, I should go. Bye, you guys.          ",0
"1749","2414493","Student","             I know I shouldn't be sitting here typing away, but it's therapy.  So what's new? I still haven't gotten over the fact that it's March, but I've forgiven myself already since it's only day two and I can't expect much. Just got back from volunteering at the hospital, and every bit of me is tired. T was there doing her training hours today, though, and she went with me on 'most every errand--we transported a funky flower balloon arch, cooed at the babies in the nursery, did more mundane things. So that was satisfactory. Very much so, actually.  My friendship with T always makes me wonder where I stand on her friend spectrum, if it can be called that. I'm sure she has much more interesting people to talk to and all, and I can hardly be labeled as the type who could associate with her and be on her good side, but apparently I've stuck around for longer than I expected, lol. She's a good person and all, and I think preparing myself for the fact that I can't depend on her for everything is what? a spoonful of sugar when the medicine goes down, or however that goes.  I am slacking off so much in journalism that it makes me Cringe. Yes, with a Capital C. Frankly, I wouldn't mind if I just had a rest break in the middle of the day, but I just don't want to upset Mrs. B, and I'd feel evil if I was using her. So I just finished B's editorial today, and I still have to finish the Dick van Dyke story and start the one on the library. lol. How the hell am I going to do that one?   So B is bi. Thank you.  Why does loss of innocence come in stages? I used to be so detached from wild society and then I found out about parties and druggies and the like. And now I have somewhat gained a little more freedom, only to discover other disturbing facts. Is it unusual that I am always a step behind? What does that say about my development? Outside perception (if it even matters)?  Read more Pablo Neruda.         ",0

The wedding...   As you might have seen the last post I had was three days before the wedding. And then I went all silent on you. Well, it was much to do those last three days. We had to get all the last things together. We had to decorate the house we had rented. We had to decorate the church, We had to practise and schtuff...etc, etc.   But finaly the day was there, and boy was I nervous!!  urlLink The curch  was perfect. The weather was  more  than perfect! The wedding started at 13:00 (one o'clock) on Saturday. As the musicman started playing the weddingmarch I couldn't stop smiling. Because there came  urlLink the most beautiful bride  I had  EVER  seen! I had to remind my self to breath more than once. She was so beautiful that the first thing I said to my best man when she entered the curch was;  'Oh my God, she's so beautiful!!'  I didn't even know I said it untill he told me after the wedding. But I think God will forgive me, don't you?...hehe. The priest was an unusualy cool priest, so the wedding went smooth and was kinda amusing at times :)  Then we drove of for the photosession. In a '58 Buick! Damn, that car was  fly! . Oh, here's a picture of  urlLink us kneeling for the blessing . Almost forgott to add that one.  After the photosession (you'll get to see those pictures later, when I get the time to scan'em...) we went to the house we rented for dinner and coffee. And a whole  urlLink lotsa   urlLink cake!  And a huge wedding cake, made by BM 2 's sister. Here are some pictures of that:  urlLink 1 ,  urlLink 2 ,  urlLink 3 ,  urlLink 4 ,  urlLink 5 ,  urlLink 6 .  And the party went on for hours, long into the night. We had many fun games, i.e a  urlLink question game  where we had to answer on who did what in our relationship...very funny. Not to many answers where alike though...hehe. And a  urlLink weird play  where the people playing had to have  urlLink matches in their mouths.  So their lines where  urlLink quite amusing , even for the  urlLink players ! And we even had a  urlLink musical act  :^)  Then, after many hours of fun and talking, smiling, being taken pictures of...etc...etc, we went to the hotell for our wedding night *wink wink*. But enough of that, here are some more pictures from the party that night:   urlLink my aunt and her twins singing a song for us   urlLink my buddies  (from the right; my best man Tor Atle, John Thomas and Vidar)  urlLink my wife and her bridesgirl   urlLink my mom and dad enjoying the cake   urlLink the new family   urlLink me and my wife  and  urlLink me and my wife again   Now that's about all there is to say about out wedding day at the moment. There's more to come later one so don't panic ;^)   After we got home...  ...I started my new job, quite fun I must say. And we went on a small vacation this weekend. Now  that  was a great thing to do. We really needed that time off after all this planning and shit. And we had a great time. just the two of us...all alone...in a cabin with a sauna and other nice things ;^)  So, did you make it this far? Wow! You're a great reader/fan/friend then :^)  Sorry about the size of the pictures, but I didn't wanna spoil the great quality to much. So now you know why I've been so quiet these past weeks.

"1755","2394435","Education","                 Psych, Part VI Tuesday, April 4th I need to catch up since Friday. When I saw S. she suggested a book to get to read which I picked up last night. I feel a little funny about reading like somehow if I read it I wiil get in on some kind of secret and I won't get better. Saturday we did some cleaning. It was really nice out and while Peter and Garrett ran errands I got a little gardening done and I read two chapters for class. Over the weekend I decided I will accept a place in the Master's program at Uconn. Saturday night we went to Mom and Dad's for dinner and cake and coffeee. I got some very nice things. Sunday we went out to dinner with my parents and P.'s bothers and Dad and E. It was very nice. I didn't think I would like it as well as I did. P. did some very nice things for me this weekend. I just wish I could be better for him.  Yesterday I was very agitated all day. I did get some work done and at home I picked up a bit and did laundry. I also did the grocery shopping. While I was shopping I bought razorblades. I was a little nervous about buying them, I thought someone would know what they were for, but just having thme made me feel better, like I had some control back. I did cut myself, I'll have to be careful, because they cut very easily.  Today, I am feeling better than I did yesterday. I am a bit self-conscious about my arm because I am wearing something short-sleeved, but noone has said anything. I am a bit worried about what will happen when I go see Dr. P. on Thursday. I am going to try to make arrangements in case I have to go back to the hospital. It's somewhat comforting to thnk about going back but I wouldn't want all that medication again. I'll just have to see what happens.  Saturday, April 8th I haven't been taking time for myself or writing everyday. I cut myself again on Tuesday night. Garrett had gone to visit with A. I cut pretty deep and it took me about 15 minutes to get it to stop bleeding. On Wednesday, the school nurse put a butterfly bandage on it. When I went to see Dr. P. on Thursday he made a good point. I cut myself because I was angry because I couldn't get things done for P. and G. but cutting myself did not make that better. I gave him the blades and felt safer. On Friday S. pointed out that cutting was an addiction like a drug. Even though they wer both right I still have wanted to cut myself and today I felt like killing myself. I am feeling better-the thoughts are not constand but they do come and go. If I cut myself again I am supposed to write down the 'trail' of thoughts that lead to cutting. When we got home from the Pinewood Derby I had a snack then went for a bike ride. It was really hard getting up the hill and now it is too windy and P. will come get me but it did help the bad feelings go down a bit. Sometimes I feel like a little kid. I passes a student who graduated in January. As I passed her I thought how mature and stable she seems. Even at school I always felt that she was the adult and I was the child. I really envy her. I have tried to pinpoint what makes me feel so bad but I just start thinking about one thing and it leads to another until it is too overwhelming and I feel like I can't stand it anymore.  My mother asked if she could talk to S. about what I have. I haven't told her the new diagnosis, I don't really want to. I feel very ashamed of it, like I can't control myself like other adults do.  I felt bad for S. this week. She seemed to have a busy week and seemed tired. I felt bad telling her all this stuff since she had such a week. I feel like I am always complaining and never finding anything good but there to be some good things. This morning as we were leaving Foxy climbed a tree to catch something and then jumped down again. It was pretty funny to watch. She's really a good cat and spends a lot of time with me. Skittles is good too but she is much more independent.  It has felt good sitting in the sun all day. I stopped by the stream on the way up and listened for a while. It was very soothing and I was tempted to take my shoes and socks off and put my feet in because the water didn't feel too cold.  I just saw someone I know (but don't recognize) with her two boys (about 2). A wave of darkness came over just like earlier today at the Derby with all those people seeming so happy and normal like I want to be again! Nobody has any idea how bad I feel and none understand. I just want to know that this will get better!  Wednesday, April 12 The week has not been good. I am finding it more difficult to concentrate on anything. Monday I went shopping and bought more razors. Today has been the first day I have really felt like cutting myself. On Monday evening I spent about an hour with my Ativan debating whether or not to take it. I felt there were few things left to do. I am more prepared today. I am still not sure I have enough to do more than put me ina comea-I was angry with Dr. P on Monday because he only gave me 14.  I got more reading done and have completed my application acceptance. However I don't believe I will be able to do my presentation next week as scheduled. Since G. stated taking his allergy medicine he seems much better. He is sleeping better and his attitude is better. P. is getting nervous about work again. They will have a meeting on Friday when he will find out what is going on. I didn't handle that as well as I would have liked last time and this time I am not sure I can handle it all. I feel like everything at home is back to normal except me. I don't wnat to have to think about things like the bills, insurance, etc. It's just all too frustrating. And then I come to work and feel like I do little. I am not really teaching. I doubt I am affecting any of the kids.  I know I shouldn't cut but right now it is the only way I can feel better. I don't know what I'll do at S.'s today. If I tell her she will take these things from me and I won't have control again.  R. said he thought if I killed myself that God would still love me but he thought I would have be held accountable for what happened here. I don't think it would be too bad here-people would get along without me. I just want to leave a few instructions so things go smoothly.  Thursday, April 13 I am back at Natchaug which is good because I feel safe. I know that I can't really follow through on thoughts of hurting myself.  I'm angry with myself for not following through and I am still having trouble with givving S. the pills. Right now it is nice just to sit and not have to think.  Friday, April 14 They have let me off constant observation so I will be able to go down and get dinner and go out on the unit I met with Dr. S today and along with changing my meds (again) he also said a couple of things which seemed to make sense and have put a little twinge into me. First he said that it sounded like I was feeling a little sorry for myself and he's right. He also said I have to work on getting better. He said it won't be easy, but I have to do it. I guess the first thing made more of an impression. I need to adapt to things and get going or I will never be back to where I used to be or maybe I don't want to be and that's the whole point.               ",0

"1761","2349612","Education","       as promised... as if this is exciting... heh  (1) road construction:  going less than 10 miles in 2 hours on the interstate is pretty outrageous... whoever's in charge of pennsylvania interstate construction should know better than to filter 3 lanes of harrisburg interstate traffic through a rest area PARKING LOT!  it's one thing to merge everyone into one lane, (which some people can't handle already!)  it's a totally other thing to filter that one lane through a parking lot where people are pulling in and out and blocking the one lane of traffic... summary: i was incredibly annoyed friday afternoon.  (2) best lunch for $1.35 ever made up for the construction though =)  to get to g-ma's i drove the better part of 200 miles on the PA turnpike... a few of the travel plazas have farmers markets and this trip was the first i'd noticed any of them being open.. for $1.35 i got two huge green bell peppers and a cucumber and ate them as i drove for lunch... it was a party :-)  (3) i rambled about the g-ma thing already before i left... i guess the weird part is, although she's been in the nursing home for 4 years now, for the first 3 or so, whenever we visited her behavior was consistent... not really better, not really worse.... from my most recent visits (june 2003, august 2003, november 2003, january 2004, this weekend) there's been noticeable changes from june/aug to nov/jan and from nov/jan to now... last summer g-ma was slow to respond and didn't speak clearly (half her vocal chords are paralyzed and half her mouth muscles too so that's how it is), but she answered the questions you asked her, and remembered things.... in november she started acting kind of weird... like would have me push her in her wheelchair 'to my other room' or 'to the room at the end of the hallway' giving me directions as we went and then she'd end us up at a fire escape or something and seem extremely disoriented... but at least in november she was happy to see us and had a 'good day' the first day or two we were around even if she got tired later in the visit... this time, the first 3 of the 4 days we were around the response to 'how are you?' was 'miserable'... reaching for things that weren't there... responding to different questions than we asked, or completely neglecting to notice someone had asked her something... and just about every time she did answer what was asked of her, the answer was completely false (e.g. mom asked her how church was last week and g-ma's response was 'i didn't go... my stomach hurt too bad'... but mom's sister debbee was up for the weekend and took her to church!)... mostly it's weird to see someone who you remember clearly as who they used to be become trapped in a physical and mental prison and slowly slip away from you... i have issues with this and i'm not sure how to phrase my thoughts... i have a hard time with the fact that i'm the only grandchild who has opportunity to visit her reasonably regularly and isn't 'afraid' of her like my younger cousins are... i have a hard time with myself that i feel like i need to bring 'props' (e.g. my photo albums) to be able to talk to her... i feel ridiculous when g-ma tries to speak and we all have to ask her to repeat multiple times before anyone has a clue what she said... i miss the friend of a grandparent she once was and have a hard time responding within myself to how she is now, even if my mom and her sisters compliment me on how i respond to her and engage her on the outside.  yeah, i have issues with this  (4) mom and i had planned to see 'raising helen' on saturday, since she wanted to and i was willing to see it again for her sake... turns out though that the time we showed up for (based on friday's posted times) turned out to be a sneak preview of 'the notebook' which doesn't come out for 2 more weeks... it was remarkably serendipitous that that's what happened and that we got to see it together... basically an old man is reading a story to an old woman and it flashes back and forth between him reading to her now and to the story he's telling about the 1940s... it comes out eventually that they're married and he's reading their life story to her because she can't remember it because she has senile dementia... the ending is a tearjerker, even for me, who reacts, but doesn't usually *cry* at movies... best line? alli: (lady with senile dementia, in a rare state of knowing what's going on) 'so what are you going to do when i don't remember anything at all? how will you deal with it?' noah: (her husband): 'i'll still love you and still be here for you... even then' considering we had just been talking about changes with g-ma over dinner right before it, it hit especially close to home to watch that later on... duuude.  (5) besides taking my step g-pa out to lunch on sunday after church (which is interesting b/c out of mom's generation, he talks most freely with her, and out of the grandkid generation, he seems to have the most idea of what to say to me), mom had plans to have lunch with her best friend from high school... i'd heard lots about karen but never met her, which was entertaining since mom considers her to be one of her closest 3 friends, and i know the other 2 extremely well... very cool lady... it was fun... and entertaining to see another side of mom for a bit.  (6) today, after visiting w/ g-ma for a bit, mom and i drove up to alleghany cemetary... my g-pa, his parents, and my uncle (mom's brother who died of cancer at age 6) are all buried there at the top of the highest hill in the place... to put it in context, this place is hundred of acres huge and has graves dating back for hundreds and hundreds of years... impressive mausoleums and war monuments in many parts... all my schumann relatives are buried though at the top of a hill overlooking the city, with a huge statue of jesus holding up a dove to the sky in the middle of their section... it's kinda nice... no one had been up there to clean off the headstones since christmas time, so we worked on that for a bit, talked a bit, and then headed back to aunt pris's before mom had to fly and i had to drive home... i guess in summary it's been kinda a death/old age oriented weekend...  (7) on a cheerier note, when we got back to aunt pris's place, i chatted with her for an hour while mom read, and then headed home to jersey... i like chatting with aunt pris... she talks to me as an equal and relates to me and vice versa, and i like that. =)  plus she's not nosy in a mom/other aunts kind of way... maybe it's the she's the youngest in her generation of the family and i'm the oldest of the next generation thing, but whatever it is, i like her. =)  (8) upon returning, ben and i saw 'stepford wives' which i enjoyed, but a couple parts freaked me out to jumping halfway out of my seat... doht... also noted a new starbucks on the way, which is the 3rd one within a 5 minute drive of my place... this makes me happy! =)  (9) no new project for work yet... i guess this means tomorrow i read and convince myself to start preparing my dreaded talk for the REU kids for next tuesday... yikes!  (10) amanda basically moved out yesterday since she's done with her summer internship... she'll be in and out but mostly out for the rest of the summer, so i'll probably read a lot and be nocturnal by choice... by all means, please call and entertain me :-)  yeah, that really *is* the loong version, eh?  i'm done, really, i am.  night y'all. =P         ",0

"1763","2344347","Religion","              Honduras Bound     &nbsp;  This evening, 16 of our folks from CrossBridge will begin the trek to Tegucagalpa, Honduras for a week-long mission effort. Though I won't be making the trip to Central America, I am driving a portion of the group to Nashville. There, they will join another church group and fly to Tegucagalpa via Miami.  &nbsp;  My heart will be in Honduras with them. The people in this region are desperately in need of the basics. This group, as many others do throughout the summer months, will build houses (really basic, one room structures), treat the sick (a number are medical personnel), work among the orphans (taking them clothes, shoes and toys), and basically love the children in that region.  &nbsp;  This trip, and the images that remain forever etched in my heart, remind me of Jesus' statement: 'inasmuch as you've done it unto one of the least of these, my brothers, you have done it unto me.' Jurgen Moltmann, a German theologian, has written prolifically in the area of ecclesiology. In one of his monumental books,  The Church in the Power of the Spirit , Moltmann elaborates on the concept&nbsp;he calls&nbsp; ubi Christus, ibi ecclesia . The basic meaning of this phrase is 'Where Christ is, there is the church.' Reflecting on the Matthew 25 text, Moltmann highlights the fact that Jesus uses familial language regarding the 'least of these' when speaking to those who ministered to the disenfranchised. He called them 'brothers.' Contrarily, Jesus does not again use the familial modifier when speaking to those who refused help.  &nbsp;  From this omission, Moltmann argues that Jesus was reminding the Matthean community--and all subsequent Christian communities--that in embracing the 'least of these' they were unwittingly embracing Him. And, where he is, there is the church--the people of God. Moltmann, in the liberationist theological tradition, seems to be arguing that the real church, then, is found among the disenfranchised, not among good religious folk.  &nbsp;  While Moltmann likely pushes the point too far, he does make an important statement. While we talk about 'bringing Christ' to the poor in our mission efforts, this text reminds us that, in so doing, we paradoxically find him there. May we see in the aching eyes of everyone in need a reflection of Jesus...and may we embrace Him there.  &nbsp;  Pray for all Christians everywhere who take mission trips this summer that they might experience Christ among the 'least of these.'

The 'Cut & Paste' EMAILS, which will be available for everyone's use will be up tomorrow. If you want to write your own PLEASE DO. (This and that 1 will be posted at all 3 Cabin Fevers- Official, Rant and Tribe). So PLEASE SEND THIS TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO CAN READ. D-DAY is the 19th so let's lock and load people and email the info below to as many people, Groups or Government Officials as you can. After this is over I think I'll sleep for 3 days, either that or 'seize out', Hell knowing me- I'll probably do BOTH!  My Arm to Yours! Slan leat,  Elaine  AKA Cabin Fever  PS I got mostly Florida or Hillsborough County groups or Chapters of the USF Pagan Union, the AOH, KOC, NAACP-US, NAACP-FL, AI-USA, Self-Reliance, Inc., Fl Center for Independent Living, Several Catholic Churches, The Crisis Center of Tampa, Meals on Wheels, the Committee to Re-Elect The President, The GOP, The Democratic National Committee, a few media people and more 'bottom feeding politicians' than I care to name. If I forgot anyone let me know! ALSO FEEL FREE TO SEND THEM EVEN IF YOU THINK I GOT THERE FIRST. Remember my Brain Damage? Also, it NEVER HURTS to write some of these people more than once! e/cf  January 7th, 2004  Dear __________:   In November of 2003 Governor Jeb Bush eliminated another 42-million dollars from the Department of Children & Families (AKA DCF) after his plan to manage costs resulted in an increase and not the decrease he claimed his ADA Initiative would provide. Many of the programs eliminated were those that provided assistance to the poor and Disabled or Elderly Homebound a group that is the least able to advocate for themselves. In some cases Florida State Social Workers have advised Homebound clients with relatives elsewhere 'â€¦to move because Florida can no longer provide the basic services you need'. We do not feel that the task of caring for Florida's citizens is the job for another State or their taxpayers. All attempts to deal with the Governor have been met with lies and evasions. Due to the circumstances an email campaign, 'For Those Who Cannot Speak' was begun. The goals of which are as follows:   I The return of the funds and the reinstatement of Homebound Social Workers, Services and Assistance cut or curtailed by the DCF. That a Committee of Florida Legislators, Medical and Social Service Workers and Homebound citizens determines the services most needed by the Clients.  II That the Governors so-called program for the Disabled known as the 'Department of Management Services with the State of Florida, The Clearinghouse on Disability Information, The Real Choice Partnership Project (A Grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.) be dissolved and the all funds transferred to the DCF to be used for Client Services.  III That an Independent Agency is appointed to investigate the use or possible misuse of funding provided by the Federal Government as part of the grant obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. And to investigate the termination of Florida State Benefits to those who have protested the cuts to the Press and Legislators.  IV That the State of Florida adopt a system similar to that of the Social Security Administration (SSA). Once qualified a Permanently Disabled or Elderly Homebound client would not be forced to submit the same information year after year. Instead they would be monitored through the use of information already provided by the SSA. The DCF would then conduct random auditing and require the Client or Duly Appointed Caregivers to report all changes in income, health or residence, etc. with the understanding that failure to comply will result in the suspension or termination of services. This change will result in a more fiscally responsible use of the taxpayerâ€™s dollars. It will also free State Social Workers to handle reasonable caseloads and provide vital monitoring of the Children of Florida.  To this end each individual supporting the FTWCS Campaign will send an email to Governor Jeb Bush. Those residing in the State of Florida will copy their email to President George Walker Bush. Those residing in other states will also copy the Governor of his or her State. Those who are not American Citizens will write directly to the President with a copy to Governor Bush.  In order to honor the late Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. an Advocate of Peaceful Social Action and who died for his Principles all emails will be sent on January 19th of 2004.  Your endorsement and your involvement in this effort would greatly benefit the Disabled or Elderly Homebound of Florida. Further information, including links to Jeb Bush, George Walker Bush and a listing of Governors of each State may be found at the following website: www.cabinfever.modblog.com.  Thank you for your attention to this matter, I hope that you will join us, along with several Universities, the Knights of Columbus and the Ancient Order of Hibernians, to name a few, in our effort to support some of the most vulnerable of Florida Citizens.

"1765","233277","Internet","       Tonight I am going to try to get my DVD player to work. Then, I am going to the gym because my uterus feels like it is falling out and I need to take my mind of physical pain. Then when I come back, I'm going to smoke some fine herb. If my DVD player is working, I'm going to watch Viewphoria because I still like the Smashing Pumpkins, and I don't care what you think about that.   I also need to find out if MyPleasure.com has a return policy on vibrators. (Don't get the  urlLink Scintillator .)I'm guessing they don't. BUT, the last few times I tried to use it, I needed to put in the batteries BACKWARDS (what?!) to make it work, plus strategically hold the little speed adjuster thing otherwise it was going all over the place. Not what you typically want in a vibrator. That's ok though, because I still have a few trusty backup devices. I'm still sad though, because no device beats the pink vibrator. No other device. *sigh* I also found that I need to stop stashing sex toys underneath my bed, as people tend to look under it. Chris did the other night when I was cleaning because the bunny was under there. He didn't say anything, but HE HAD TO SEE THE STASH. How mortifying. Oh well, we hear each other get down all of the time because our walls are so thin, I doubt anything is too taboo anymore.   I hate having roommates sometimes, though. Alas.             ",0

"1769","2311002","Telecommunications","       Today's lunch break found me addressing some grooming and shopping needs. After a tasty meatball sub at subway, I scampered off to have my monthly hair extraction. Once my bikini line and legs from the knees down were nice and hairless, I decided I have neglected to buy my bottom something in a long time. In the Bays lingerie section I discovered these AWESOME (they deserve description in capital letters) Calvin Klein undies. Soft stretchy microfiber with no seams in amazing colours and a great bikini cut that is a little low but not plumber ass crack kinda low. and 30% off to boot!! So I helped myself (and realize I am aware I am buying a house and I should not be spending the moola) to 6 pairs, 4 bikini style in black, hot pink, white and orange and 2 in a thong version in black and blue. Gorgeous colours, my butt will be pleased. Have you bought your bum a treat lately? (insert joke here, I know how easy it will be to come up with one after a line like that)  Now I know what some may think - those aren't sexy undies, have I accepted defeat, and switched over to the granny pants? yes and no. I think they are a different kind of sexy. no, its not lace or see through mesh, but that's so frilly and impractical. Those are useful for the naughty special events, but these are just cute and comfortable, and can be worn without irritation during exercise. So no, I haven't gotten rid of the lingerie goodies (everyone breathe a sign of relief for Glen) but I am accepting a new undies phase in my life.   and speaking of bums: The opening sequence of lost in translation was a long shot of scarlett johansson's butt in some filmy cotton undies. speaking from a purely straight girl angle, she's got a fine bottom. Apparently the underwear were a one of a kind pair made exclusively for her, for the movie intro, commissioned by Sophia Coppola. Anyway, since then, many women have clamored for those underwear (and to have an ass that looks like scarlett johansson's), so now they will sell them for like 60$ US a pop.          ",0

"1772","2303699","Science","                 In Venezuela I was one of the pharmacy workers who actually got to converse with the people.  Oh, by the way, it's not  de nada , it's  a la orden .  I was wondering what the funny looks were for every time I said thank you.  Dialect.  Shoot.  So we must have handed out over 1000 prescriptions.  It's unbelievable that what you and I take for granted, they hold in high value down there.  For example, tylenol is fairly unimportant to us, but there are people there who don't even have money for regular pain relief.  I remember one man in particular who had traveled down the mountain 7 km just to see us.  I ended up giving him extra tylenol because at 77, I knew that climbing back up that mountain was a chore for him.  We didn't have too many severe cases, just many children who needed more nutrition and anti- parasitic drugs.  Jeremy knows more about the real condition of everyone since he had the priveledge of interpreting for Aleesha, a pediatrician.  Over all I was happy that I could understand most everything (after I had to ask them to speak slower).  But the one thing I didn't learn was how to say that Pepto would turn your you-know-what black.  Not sure if I want to know!   I'm kind of walking in the clouds today because I had to stay up last night to finish my honors project.  (For those of you who know me...some things never change, right?)  But I turned it in today! Yeah!  I think they're going to like it even though I know there are still some mistakes in it.  But now all I have to do is get caught up in everything else.   This weekend is going to be awesome.  Happy Valentines Day!  I get to go to a 5 star hotel in Atlanta tomorrow with my cutie pie.  They have a pool, hot tub, full service...I think I'm just going to sit in the hot tub for 3 hours.  I can't wait to relieve some of the stress of school!  Don't worry, it's not officially a pleasure trip since the reason we have to go down there is because of Jeremy's job.  But we're definitely making the most of it.           ",0
"1773","2299261","Non-Profit","       Hey friends!  It's been awhile, but I have enjoyed catching up by reading your bloggings :)   What a weird, but sweet season singleness is!  Ha!  I have found myself on the good days rejoicing for this precious time Jesus allowes me to spend with Him alone--when my heart is not divided and my desires are for only Him. Then one the not-so-good days, I cry when I think about the bitter lonliness that comes from not having a companion, someone to share my dreams with, someone to help make them a reality, and bring glory to our Father, TOGETHER.  A wise friend of mine once said to me over coffee, 'Les, contentment is not saying, 'Oh, I could be single for the rest of my life because I have Jesus.'  Instead it's saying, 'Lord, You are God, and that's enough for the rest of my life, no matter what the circumstances--I WILL trust in You because of Who You are.''  Learning to be content for the sake of my relationship with Jesus--though I am so far from it--that's what makes this season purposeful.    I totally am all about the being pursued thing.  I trust that just like God formed Eve FOR Adam, He also has purposed relationships to bring honor to Himself and joy to those in the relationship.  So--I will wait with my sisters--not in idleness  but with purpose.  With my eyes concerned with the whereabouts of my King, His kingdom, and His righteousness.  All these things (including that sweet man of mine one day) will be added...  Wait on sweet ladies, wait for Him.  Pray sweet men, pray for wisdom to find her...  Much love from O-town, Les :)          ",0
"1774","2299048","indUnk","       I spend a large chunk of my day in the car. Due to traffic, when I'm driving from home to work, it can take me a good 75 minutes. Sadly, that's 'fast', as before I found this 'shortcut', it used to take me 2 hours. TWO HOURS to drive 35 measly miles.   But enough of that bitching. Suffice it to say, I get to spend a lot of time in traffic watching other drivers. Here are some observations, and other things that give me road rage.  When in the  hell  did people stop using blinkers? I feel like there's been a county-wide memo that I didn't receive. The entire weekend, I counted how many times the person in front of me used blinkers to change lanes. Twice. That's right. A weekend's worth of driving to the beach and around the city, and TWO people used his/her blinkers. This is how accidents happen, people.   Cutting across multiple lanes of traffic in a single swoop? You can't do it, especially if there are cars on the road (and this being LA, there are  always  cars on the road). Yet people persist in trying. If you realise that you're going to miss your turn - my advice? Miss it. Circle back around. It's not going to take that much longer, and you will then not be putting your life - and the lives of others - in danger.    Along the same lines of the above annoyance - if you know that your exit is coming up soon, why don't you merge over earlier rather than later? Wait in the slow lane if necessary. It is Not Cool when you decide to zip along then BAM! realise that oh yeah, you did want to exit/make a right or left turn here, and halt all traffic in  another  because your selfish ass didn't want to wait. I'm not gonna let you in. Especially if you try to motion to me that you wanna cut. Or better yet, just edge your way in as if I wasn't there. Didn't we learn that rule in kindergarten, about cutting in line? It's not nice.    If your windows are down, and the windows of the car next to yours are down, and you talk loudly about them - there is NOT an invisible bubble that surrounds you, keeping your mocking words away from their ears. Also related to this, when windows are rolled down, it is not advisable to play a game entitled 'Spot the Hasidic Jew' which entails of you leaning out your window, pointing obviously and loudly proclaiming 'twenty five!' or whatever number you're currently on. They CAN hear you. (This is not a stranger who does this, this is sadly crankypants.)    Driving is not the time to notice and remark on pretty architecture, because it takes your attention away from the road. Also, driving is not the time to read scripts or magazines, talk on the phone if you are not a multitasker, apply mascara in moving traffic or eat soup or anything else that spills. I cannot stand it when people do this. Unless one has two sets of eyes and two pairs of hands, such feats are impossible.  And a tip for those drivers, who say, daydream whilst sitting at a red light and consequently perhaps don't realise when the light turns green (not that I've, ahem, ever been guilty of this). When people give you dirty looks, or honk their horn, pass you and  then  give you a dirty look - rather than giving them the finger or returning their dirty look, stick out your tongue instead. Perhaps it's not the most mature thing to do, but the look on their faces is priceless. They just don't know what to do.             ",0
"1775","2298245","Student","             Sorry my blog self has been a little non-existent, but once again the second year of law school is threatening to overwhelm me.  So I've been a little busy.  Since blogging provides too much of a distraction to me, I have been leaving my computer at home and spending lots of time at school in an effort to up my productivity.  It has not necessarily helped so much, but I will be getting a much needed break this week, no school from tomorrow through Monday.  Well, at least there are no classes, but I will still be deeply absorbed in the worlds of Business Organizations and Evidence, not to mention a glance over or two of my paper, most likely on the plane ride home tomorrow.  It has been a bad week.  I have been dealing with a lot of difficult and unecessary anger.  I think I am finally starting to get past it, but every time I think that, it resounds upon me once again.  I am hoping that going home, and seeing my family again, will help make it more bearable.  At least this is my hope.  I think I just need to get away from New York, and law school, and everything else in my life up here.  Of course, there are unique challenges awaiting me there, such as seeing my sister for the first time after our unpleasantness of Sunday.  Plus there will be many distractions that I will have to do my best to avoid if I am to make it a relaxing, yet productive visit.    So, all of this is to say that you, my faithful readers, may be seeing precious little of me over the next few days.  I will do my best to stay in touch, and update you all on my progress back to normalcy.  It's really time to dig in now, and I know I will be able to, if I can just let go of a few things, and since I have to, I know I'll be able to.  I hope everyone who is celebrating something this week enjoys their festivities and their reflections on the meaning of the season are worthwhile.  If not, I hope you at least get some holiday time to relax and recoup.  Take care, and I'll see you on the other side, if not sooner.         ",0

"1777","2298245","Student","             I have not blogged on either one of the brutal beheadings of American citizens that have occurred recently, and I feel the absence of anything about this on my blog is conspicuous, given my feelings and beliefs about world events, so I figured a short explanation might be in order.  There are a couple of reasons:  1. I am very angry about it, and it is hard for me to adequately express my anger and still stay lucid and coherent.  This is doubly true when I am as busy as I have been.  I do not have the time to sit down and focus on the problem to the extent necessary to make my thoughts readable.  I have been working on a post about my anger for months - my general anger, the big anger that has never left me once since 9/11 - and this is unusual for me, since I usually just tap something out quickly and post it.  You're lucky if I run a spell check.  I have not posted it yet, though, because though I have been working on it for a while, I just can never quite get the words right.  Perhaps one day I will be able to present it.  2.  I am going through a down period at the moment - missing my family, fed up and unhappy with school, general summer blah-ness - and I just don't think that I can handle focusing too much on it right now at the moment.  Just thinking about it makes me want to give up on this world completely, with all the things that are wrong with it.  This makes me very selfish I know, but it is the way I have to be to survive.  Perhaps some day I can come back and look at this.  I felt like a heel out enjoying myself with my family this past week, thinking about this man's life hanging in the balance and then hearing that it was abruptly ending.  Life goes on, I know, but it is harder for someone like me, who gets caught up in the little things of life that the big ones often seem unbearable.  Seeing the graphic pictures on Drudge made me burst into tears.  It makes me wonder whether all of this is worth the bother, even though I know it is.  Robert, the Expat Yank,  urlLink sums it up best :   I can't be the only one who REALLY would like to drop an atomic bomb on someone, tonight . . .  Oh, well . . . you know I don't mean that. I know I don't, too. We never mean that.   And that's the difference between us -- and them. That's what makes us better than them. Never forget that.   I have not forgotten, not completely.

You may find me waiting at the Farmers' Market in Kansas City, trying to find my mom and nephew, sitting on the curb as strange men give me sidelong glances and cheap strawberries continue to waft in the breeze, scent of ripeness ready to turn rotten. I am writing on a piece of scratch paper and people seem to think this is odd, a woman on the curb by the potted plants, not too far from the strawberries, scribbling down what she sees as she gets stood-up, accidentally, by her loved ones. There are tan vendors with greasy creases in their jeans on cell phones, lots of couples who make me wonder if the Farmers' Market is a place only bookends go to, overweight consumers with tiny dogs and purses and yours truly waiting on her curb with her pen and paper. Maybe those who gave the strange or lecherous or curious glances were wondering if I was for sale too.

But to be frank, I think if this is true I would be more educated than some people at least. Something to be proud of huh.  But I can't help it when I get irritated, or in common language, pissed off. Arh. Slowly, I can feel that my mind is opening, and seeing more and more and most of all, rejecting less of it. Which is good. yah.  At the moment, two people are irritating me. Thank goodness, irritation only strikes once in a while. But when it does they bother me enough.  Some times, people pretend to be someone they are not. But what if being someone you ARE, will hurt certain other people around you?   And what if some people who matter to you can't accept who you are.  The betrayal of trust. The assertion that you are guilty, without even a proper trial (or an understandable from my point of view.)  And rubbing salt into the wound.  Perhaps the person may not have meant it, perhaps she did. But oh well.  Whatever there is, we (or I) have to go on.      ",0

Get there, to be met by a girl who says&nbsp;'Did you  call ?' Um, no. Didn't really feel like giving up my daughter over the phone. Well, they're full. Period. Gave me the numbers of other no-kills in the area, most of them in the south Chicago suburbs, so an hour or hour and a half away. I'm certainly willing to go that far, but not until I know they'll take her. So I just went home. So I have to go through all that emotional girding of loins again next weekend. Assuming I can find somewhere that can take her - it is kitten season, after all.  The upside of this (and I looked long and hard to find one) is that Mike still thinks I'm cute when I've been crying and my eyes are all puffy.&nbsp; And he knows how to hold a sobbing woman - quietly, and with plenty of kleenex nearby.

I just want to be understood and i thank you for caring enough to read.  9/18/03 Today was kinda weird.  I was content...sorta...i still miss kari...and getting to be around her.  i dont like the fact that seth and kari are close.  i hate not getting to be close to her...we hardly ever talk anymore...she seems to have moved on.  i kinda screwed up our friendship.  i kept on bringin up how i missed her and all...and i really do...but i dont think she understands that...she never loved me...not like i loved her.  love never dies and what she felt for me died...it was never love.  that hurts but i guess there really is nothin i can do to change that.  she seems so happy around seth now...and i guess that helps me...cuz now she can be happy...and that makes me happy. i've kinda moved on.  im talkin to mallory.  she's an awesome person.  she's not like anyone i've ever met.  her outlook on life just makes me cry.  its like someone i've been lookin for all my life...she doesnt worry bout anything...she can always find somethin good in everything that goes bad.  she makes me smile.  she makes me just think bout stuff totally differently.  i wanna say i love her...and i do in a way...maybe not as a girlfriend just yet... but there is hope and that helps me.  its kinda weird for me...i mean i really dont need someone to be happy but my gosh it makes things so much easier if i do have someone.  and mallory seems to be that person...its kinda weird...i still have feelings for kari but in a way i think that mallory would be better.   i think the major problem for me is that i dont want a girlfriend like everyone else wants.  i have many friends...and all of them care for me...they all care about me and love me...but there is a problem...i guess its not a real problem...just a personal problem for me.  all my friends are here for me...usually...but then they get boyfriends or girlfriends and i suddenly become second.  i cant help that and i dont blame people for that...they are only human...but it hurts and its happened to me alot.  like all the sudden people dont have time for me.  thats why i want my girlfriend to be my bestfriend...cuz then i know that my friend will never not have time for me.  she'll always be there when i need her.  thats what i want from her...thats all i'd ask...and i'd give her whatever she'd want from me...i gave kari my heart and i think that i might be able to give that to someone else since she didnt want it.   so now its mallory...she's great...wonderful person.  i was worrying about her today...i was worried bout what i should do bout our relationship.  we both know that we're interested in eachother...and she's wise to tell me that we should wait.  and i was also worried that now that she's starting to get scared of me.  cuz like i tell her bout how i am and how i worry bout stuff...and about my chest pain...and i was afraid she would just not like me anymore cuz im so messed up.  but she said that it was all ok and that she still likes me and that she thinks i should take more time to get over kari and work on my problems.  but she said she'd wait for me and that she'd be here...and my gosh that makes me feel so good that someone would wait for me...that she cares enough to wait.  makes me feel great.  cuz im wanted and somebody cares.   well gosh this is long...and its only the first day...this is gonna be huge in like a month!  hehehe!  yanno now that i think bout it this is kinda nice...i get to just write everything down and its nice to let out...of course you cant talk back...but thats ok at least you're reading...well thats bout it for tonight...im tired and talkin to L...probably goin to bed soon...ttyl bye!  9/19/03 today was ok again...nothin great happened...mallory was kinda quiet today...dunno why...she's really sweet when she talks to me but then she's like mallory when we're around everyone else...she likes to joke around...its great...i need the time to let out some stress.   i kinda realized today that i do still love kari...i really miss her bad.  she doesnt talk to me anymore really...she's hurt or somethin and that just really bothers me.  she's so happy with seth now...she's always so happy and smiling around him...i dunno if maybe she just doesnt want him to see her upset...she always seems to be upset or somethin around me...or she's just not happy...i hate not being able to make her happy anymore...it stinks so bad.  and its still hurts to see seth flirt with her...she doesnt see it but he is...im a guy i so understand.  she just thinks he's bein a good friend but it so obvious that he likes her that its not even funny.  i feel so sick...makes me feel like crap that she doesnt love me anymore...well she never did like i said yesterday but yanno what i mean.   i just dont get it and she cant give me an answer.  WHY NOT ME?  WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?  HOW CAN YOU SAY YOU LOVE ME AND YET TELL ME YOU DONT WANT TO BE MY GF?  DONT YOU MISS ME?  DO YOU HURT LIKE I DO?    she has no answer for me and i just dont understand.  i just hurts so bad.  my gosh i love her so much and yet i know i will never have her.  im trapped in a cage where im gonna have to spend the rest of my life knowing that she doest love me and that i will never be able to have her...and ill have to watch as other guys get to be close to her when i cant...and i will feel alone...not that thats new to me but its not a feeling i want to go back to feeling...which again leads to more pain.   i guess i have some bittersweet happiness...cuz at least she'll be happy and i know that i loved her mor than anyone else could....i dont think she saw that but thats ok cuz at least she'll smile again...at least i loved her enough to let her go so that she could be happy...thats what true love is...being able to let go.  but its hard to truely be happy without her...cuz she could make all my pain go away and for once in my life i could feel happiness without the pain still raging...i dunno if you could understand what its like...for it to never go away and never give you a moment of peace...no relief...nothin...just always there...and then you meet someone that lets you feel somethin that you've never felt before...somethin you take for granted cuz you can feel it whenever you want...you can be happy...you can truely be happy...you dont have to laugh while still feeling pain...you dont have to smile when inside you feel like someone is ripping your heart out.  and i finally was able to experience that with kari...she showed me happiness...and for once i could smile and be happy.  and now that its gone and that im back to the way i dunno what to do...i want to feel that again...i want to be happy.  i wrote this bout 2 weeks when ellen and i were talkin and she thought that it was stupid cuz i couldnt be happy without someone...i wrote this to put it into perspective for her...  am i stupid cuz i want someone to cry to? am i desperate cuz i want someone to hold me when i dont think i can go on? do you think im silly cuz i want to be loved? do you think so?  you try living like me for a day...you try to live with my pain...every minute of everyday...you try to find comfort...you wont find it...you wont be able to feel peace or happiness...nothing...and no one will be able to understand you...you will be alone...and you will have no one to turn to...then after all of this you tell me if you still think im silly for wanting some comfort...  kinda depressing...but its the truth...and i dont want to complain...i dont want you to feel sorry for me...i want people to understand that all those stupid things that you worry bout...all that stress you feel...just remember it could be worse...i know it could be worse for me...i dunno how much worse but i bet i could be...i really dont think people have an idea of what stress is like...i always laugh when people say 'oh im so stressed' and yes maybe they are...but they dont know what stress is...you never understand what stress is until it starts to affect you physically and it wont go away...that is stress...stress that stresses you...that is what real stress is...what you feel is more worrying...its not stress...and i envy you...i wish i could be like that...like only gettin stressed sometimes...i wish i was normal...that would satisfy me...i wouldnt mind only have a little stress instead of stress 24/7.  yeah well im ramblin now...goin to the MA homecoming game with amy & aaron later...ill be back tonight to probably write some more...till then...au revoir!  after the game...same day... just got back from the Madison Academy homecoming game...lots of fun...lots of screaming!  i saw brandon, haley, kate, nadia, katie goode, katelin passon...and a ton of others!  it was alot of fun...a nice kinda.   but now im back home and all the stuff is back...all that junk that is called my life...im talkin to mallory...and kari at the same time...kinda weird...the 2 girls i love...once that rejected me and hurt me and then the one that makes me feel like ill be ok and that ill get to keep goin on...i really want her to be mine right now...i dunno if i want that cuz i want just someone...it kinda feels right though...she's like the EXACT person i'd need...she could so help me with all my problems...but she dont wanna be like a fallback girlfriend...and i so understand cuz i wouldnt want to do that to her anyways...she doesnt deserve that...she's too great of a person to probably even deserve to be with me...im just a person full of trouble and problems... im really confused bout now bout my feelings!  i dunno what to do!  i still love kari..i still will forever...even if its in the deepest depths of my heart i will still love her always...but ill never have anything in return for that love so i gotta move on...and i want to move on to mallory and i know i could love her too...maybe even more than i ever loved kari even though i dont think thats possible but ya never know...but i dunno if im ready just yet for anyone new...but then i want someone new...someone to keep my mind off of kari...but i dont wanna just do somethin without thinking cuz if i do that then ill hurt someone...ill go out with someone and then realize i dont really like them and then ill just hurt someone...just like kari hurt me...and no one deserves that...even though it happens all the time i guess.  but still i dunno what to do... wow!  its 10:51...tiz very late...i should go to bed...but all i'd do is think some more and i kinda like writin it all down.  jennifer love hewitt is a cool singer...she's pretty good...sorry just thought i'd throw that in there.  yeah well im going to bed...if it's late when you're reading this then you need to go to bed too!  lol!  bye bye!  9/20/03 saturday...its been an ok day so far...nothin too terrible has happened.  im goin to Madison Academy's homecoming party tonight with amy...i need to go change for that in a little bit for that...im supposed to look nice...dont really wanna go but hey i thought i'd be nice since amy's been so nice to me.   i went to bed happy last night...mallory said she really was starting to like me more...WHICH IS TOTALLY AWESOME!  im pretty happy bout that...im starting to like her more too...even if its not as much as i like kari still...but kari has nothin more to give me so i need to move on to someone who does.  so im ok with this i guess...im still tryin to tell myself to forget kari cuz she'll never be there again...but my heart doesnt want to...this is so very hard...i know im in love...cuz even now...5 weeks later im still not ok...i still want kari so bad...and its not fair that i cant have her.  of course she might not be 'the one'.  would the one cause you this much pain?  what do you do when the only person who can stop your crying is the one who made you cry?   pain hasnt been too bad today...mallory has helped that i guess...OH YEAH!

YANNO IT IS SO HARD TO STOP LOVING SOMEONE!  i still dont wanna let go of kari...at least a part of me doesnt want to.  but i really like mallory.  sometimes i wish i could just forget bout kari and just move on.  but its SOOOOOOO hard!  i mean for cryin out loud im in love with her!  i hate to admit it but i still am!  and i dont know how to stop!  am i supposed to?  it just doesnt seem right...but she doesnt love me!  i with there was a book on how to handle this.  like that told me 'if you love someone and she dont love you, then you....'  and whatever!  wouldnt life jsut be great if we had a book on how to handle everything!  that'd be awesome!  i mean the bible is cool...its got everything i NEED to know to live....but like it doesnt have some of the stuff i'd like to have.  i guess thats where friends come into the picture.  L's nice...she kinda reminds me when to turn to God when im just too like stressed out to remember to do that...she's like my best Christian friend.  she's awesome!  i love her to death!  she helps me soo much!  of course she's also one of those girls that would never consider me as a bf cuz we're such good friends!  i've asked TWICE!  and she's said no both times.  i guess thats ok...i really am content with what she is to me....i like it how it is.  there are other girls.  there was kari...but now there's mallory.   i kinda wonder if mallory's got a sweet side.  i havent really seen to much of that.  not sayin that she isnt nice cuz she really is.  but yanno i like girls who can be real sweet to me.  not that i wouldnt go out with a girl who wasnt...i mean i wanted to go out with L!  hehehe!  not too much sweetness there!  mallory has been pretty sweet to me...maybe not as sweet as i'd like...but hey i might as well see what she's really like....i guess ill find out over time.  sweetness isnt exactly a priority for me...its more just will she love me back.   that'd be sweet enough for me!  hehehe!  well im bout tired out of writing for now.  ill probably be back after the devo....MISS ME!  9/23/03 well i didnt write yesterday...was i monday?  i guess so...yeah it was...wow its only tuesday...thats crazy!  i thought it would be like wednesday already.  gosh...i want this week to go by quicker!  IM READY FOR MY RETREAT!  of course L wont be there and thats not gonna be cool at all....L is so awesome!  i love her to death...she's like the person i go to when i need to just like get away from everyone else...just like free time... well mallory are like this >  after piano lessons...same day....  i still hurt....and there is still no relief...i still cry....and still no one hears...and i am still silent...still bearing what i must...still wondering why...still wondering what is to become of me...i hide among the crouds...so not to reveal my pain...i hide behind a wall to hide the cold scared confused boy...who knows not what to do...where do i turn?  who will come and tear down that wall?  who cares enough to notice?  who cares enough to hold me?  who will love me?  wrote that a couple days ago...i was really kinda feelin it again...that missin kari thing...it came back full force.  well i put it in my profile...which i usually do...and mallory read it and she said she'd love me...it was the sweetest thing...almost made me cry...she's so sweet!  i love her to death!  she really does make me feel good.   chest hasnt been hurting too much since i found out that mal likes me.  maybe that just gives me comfort...to know that someone loves you...even though yanno they dont have to...its like a choice they make.  not like a parent or sibling which kinda 'have' to love you...but some stranger who decides to love you...that makes me feel special...and i love that feeling and it kinda hides my pain...its wonderful to be able to truely feel happiness.  ok well im happy so im gonna stop writing...so i dont accidently stir up old feelings...cya tomorrow...  9/24/03 well its wednesday.  2 days till the senior high retreat!  im so ready to go!  i kinda wanted to go to the big spring jam but hey i'd really rather go to the retreat...it would benefit me more.  well...kari asked me today why i dont like talk to her at school.  and i told her the truth...it just hurts to talk to her...it just so many good memories...it brings back all the memories that i miss...and the makes me think bout that stuff that im not gonna be able to experience with her.  and i dont wanna think bout that now.  cuz i really want mallory now and i think she'll really care for me and i really hope she'll love me back.  i would love that right now.  specially from her.  yeah. well its late and i dont feel like writing any more.  9/25/03 SENIOR HIGH RETREAT TOMORROW!  woohoo!  i cant wait!  im so ready to go!  oh yeah!  go kris!  gettin out of here!  i had my choir concert today...i thought it was ok...most people thought it was great and it was...we were very good.  chest pain hasnt been to bad this week...i guess thats been good...im still just so emotionally just AHHH!  this is journal thing is starting to get short again.  i guess im not thinkin too much bout my pain so im not complaining about it...its so much easier just to ignore it.  yes...again im leaving...im too busy talkin to mallory to write!  so cya MONDAY!  ill be gone ALL WEEKEND!  10/4/03 well its been a LONG time since i've written in this.  alot has happened.  senior high retreat was fun.  i wish ellen had gone it would have been alot more fun with her.  she's my closest true friend.  she's so awesome!  its too bad i cant take a piece of her and just stick in here.   aww well.  leavin tomorrow for california.  goin to see Grandpa probably for the last time.  he's supposed to die in bout 2 months.  i dont seem sad do i?  i dont feel sadness.  i dunno why.  i want to say that i find comfort in knowing that he'll be in a better place...but i cant cuz he's not saved.  i think its just me.  i dont feel much anymore.  all i can feel is my pain and anxiety which focuses around my relationships and around my pain too.  i dunno if somethin's wrong with me. maybe im just too depressed and strained right now.  i just dont feel sad.  maybe i dont realize what is happening.  or maybe i just dont wanna accept it.  i dunno.  i think im just so past emotions right now.  im so sick of them.  arent emotions an amazing thing?  they can take you to highest peak and then can drag you to the darkest depths.  lol.  you can tell i've had a lot of time to think bout all of this.  i like to analyze feelings.  probably why i wanna be a psychologist.  feelings are the coolest things.  and the most terrible things too.   mallory and i are goin out now.  yep we sho are!  it was so funny.  we like to play the question game and all.  of course i tend to ask most of the questions but hey thats ok.  well the other night i asked her to ask me a question.  she asked one.  and i said yes.  LOL!  thats right!  she asked me out!  she took my job away!  lol!  it was pretty cool.  yes well now the hard part comes.  im still so in love with kari.  this is the biggest dilemma i've ever had. i love kari so much but she doesnt love me and probably never will (not that i dont have hope) and then i have mallory who is so loyal to me and likes me alot.  but it is so hard to have feelings for her.  it doesnt feel right...kari and i feel right.  my gosh i miss her so much.  but i miss mal too!  i like her and really i think she's the person i like the most after kari.  this is so hard!  what am i supposed to do?  stop following what my heart tells me is right and follow what makes logical sense?  is love logical?  why must it be so unpredictable?  why cant love work when i need it to?  why cant i be loved by the one i love?  i really hope you never have to experience this.  its not fun at all.  it hurts so bad.  especially if you're like me. i had an epiphany the other day.  i think thats how you spell it.  i realized after 2 whole yrs that ALL of my anxiety and pain revolves around 2 fears.  the fear of rejection and the fear of being alone.  that is the root of everything.  i finally figured it out.  i dunno if it makes me feel any better but at least i know why i feel this way now.  but it just makes sense.  this really all started at the end of school in 8th grade when Courtney, Vickie, Aaron, and Trey and their group (which included me at the time) started to get closer.  and i was slowly pushed out.  i felt rejected then.  and scared taht i was losing a friendship.  all that built up and i threw up on the 2nd to the last day of school from all the stress.  then in 9th grade in our first semester kari and maria were like bestfriends so they were always hangin out and trey and kari were gettin close for reasons that i cant tell you...and i just felt left out and rejected again.  and thats when i went into a depression and stopped eating and just got really low.  and of course all the 'little' incidents all revolve around my fears.  but then there is the worse rejection.  the one from kari.  my gosh that was and is the worst.  cuz not only was i rejected by someone i had given my heart to but i was also left alone.  with no one.  and i sunk.  really low.  and i got really depressed.  it was bad.  worse than anyone could have thought.  kristopher.  the good christian boy.  the boy who is always so happy.  who loves bein around peopel and jokin around.  nobody ever sees the real kristopher.  the cold scared boy who hides behind his wall as he cries.  nobody sees or hears him.  one because he hides it and 2 cuz they dont wanna think that someone around them is unhappy cuz then they get upset.  kari doesnt even know how low i got...i probably couldnt tell her anyways.  i dont want her to feel guilty.  its not really her fault...she caused it but its not her fault.  and now you're askin how low i got?  you really wanna know?  you might regret that...did you know that there are 18 knives in my house?  18.  did you know that at around 10:00 everyone but me goes to bed and im alone?  can you figure out how low i was?  i had it all planned out.  im not gonna make  you listen to that.  you probably dont want to.  but i was really close.  have you ever thought bout that?  well probably not...most people dont get that low...i wish i were like them...oh i would give so much just for a day like them.  but no have you thought...isnt it amazing how such a simple device, a blade, can take everything away.  a blade could make my pain go away and my stress just disappear.  isnt it funny how people cant help themselves but simple little things can help them.  somethin so simple could stop such a complicated problem.  man i was close.  so close.  but then i thought...if i go then what bout the people that depend on me?  what bout mallory?  she loves me...why should i put her through that pain.  or ellen...what would she think...she'd be disappointed in me.  or davida?  she doesnt deserve to be put through that.  or kari?  she doesnt deserve to feel that either or to feel guilty.  and someday she might need me...and i wouldnt be there for her.  or my family?  that would be so terrible for them.  and Jesus?  he would be so disappointed that i couldnt have faith enough to keep going.  and i couldnt kill myself because of Him.  He died for me...He gave me a gift and i would be throughing it back in his face.  i could not bring myself to do that.   but now i have to say to all of those out there that are suicidal.  if you are reading this listen to me.  this world is cruel and terrible place.  it shows no mercy to you or anyone else.  and it will never let you rest.  but think...if everyone in the world killed themselves when they got down what would the world be like?  it would be whole lot worse.  it would be hell.  you and i...we are important in this world.  all those people i mentioned above depend on me.  they depend on me to be happy at least somewhat.  they would be really sad if i killed myself.  i carry some of their pain.  they will never experience it for i am the one who does but in a way it is their  pain.  you see people who are suicidal...they are the people that carry the most pain in this world.  they are the ones who bear what others cant.  they bear the pain of the world.  but if you are one of those people dont lose hope.  dont feel alone.  dont feel cheated out of life.  there is hope.  and there is a way to feel what others are blessed enough to feel everyday.  you can be happy.  just have faith in God.  He will never leave you.  You will never be alone with him by your side.  He will ALWAYS be there.  and with Him you can live a life like everyone else and even a better life than most.  cuz what can this world do to you if you have God on your side?  and remember this verse...it is the my favorite verse in the Bible and it helps me live each day.   'Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.' -Matthew 11:28           ",0

"1805","2200790","Non-Profit","              I was in the mood to annoy people.  Haven't gotten any sleep when he texted and asked if I could meet him outside, drizzling and cold, so that he could have someone by his side to share his loneliness. True to the fact that I'm more than a good friend, I readily agreed to his proposal.  He thinks that his girl is having an affair. Since I was in the mood to bitch, I told him that I saw her in the mall, with this guy and they were holding hands and sharing a good laugh. He asked when was this.  About three weeks ago . He was surprised. And angry. Guess to whom?  Yours fucking truly.   Better try me in a good mood. Better yet, ask me something like if there is no available water around you and all you got is a surrounding of oil spills, will you drink from it?    SAGOT!     Will you ever learn?   *****  It was karma. I was annoying all living creatures that came across my senses last night, even with this friend who is a Joross lookalike. Nothing beats a good laugh when you're really tired and you wanna sleep but your eyes and spirit seemed not to cooperate. Aside from the bitchy remarks I laid on everyone during the AA meeting, Joross lookalike I bet is thinking if he should have had me deposited in Mental last night.  Too mental.   So when I received the text of Mike that I was in the headline of tabloid today, I couldn't help but think that this is just a pseudo-but-not-nearly a backfire.   'Boobsie, headline ka talaga!  Boobsie, Pinulutan sa Resort .'    To hell with them.   *****  It has been three weeks since I last saw my room clean. Three heavenly-like weeks. Now, now?  I'm living in a dumpster.    Bed:  Don't make me start. I literally cannot see what my bedsheet is with all the piles of clothes, pillows, shoes, and books atop of it. Set them aside every night for a small space to sleep in. I actually broke two CDs last night because I slept on them. What will I be breaking next?   Cabinet:  Do you know how many pairs of attire I go through every morning before I finally settle to  DA ONE ? Five on the average.  On the average.  After that, I stuff, no, throw them all back in the cabinet without even folding them. And they keep on piling up. I actually saw the pink sleeve of a favorite cardigan earlier.

"1816","2186817","RealEstate","            CANADIANS IN THE SOUTH   The Canadians finally arrived yesterday evening.  My friend, Karen, pointed out that in speaking of the Canadians invading the house, it makes it sound like they are an ominous virus descending upon our cell structure.  Well, I in no way meant to imply their visit was unwelcome.  In fact, I rather like Joel & Merredith.  Joel looks somewhat like his brother, Jeff, but for the most part looks very different.  He's alittle more laid back too.  Merrideth reminds me of prettier Bjork.  She is kind of pixie-esque, moves quickly about the house as if she is sprinkling fairy dust around the house and ends most sentences with an upward inflection as if she is always asking a question.  I noticed this because this way of speaking is noted in the book,  She's Not There , which I am currently reading.  More about that later.  We walked across the park and had dinner at Dakota Blue last night.  Joel & Merrideth thought I was joking when I mentioned the fish tacos, but Merrideth was game enough to try them.  Then we came back and crashed.  I slept eight and a half hours last night.  I normally cannot sleep beyond six or seven hours.  However, Jeff and I were exhausted from cleaning.  The only thing about impending guests that I regret, is that Jeff and I usually become very irritated with one another about this process.  Jeff's idea of cleaning is somewhere just shy of burning the entire village to ensure a complete quaratine of the ebola virus.  Places people normally don't look must be deconstructed, sanitized and reconstructed.  However, the real cherry on top of my sundae was when he made the comment about my having too much stuff in my bedroom.  I slowly looked around the house at the boxes of books and papers and tool boxes and clothes draped over furniture and said, 'My stuff is contained in my bedroom.  Your combined closet space is four times the size of mine.  I am not getting rid of all of my belongings to sastify your sense of order when you are not willing to compromise and give up your own stuff.'  Five minutes later, he decided that we could compromise by storing some of my stuff in his closet up stairs.  I'm usually pretty accommodating about living here and letting him pick out the furniture and decorations he wants.  However, this was like when Buddy cornered one of the neighborhood cats in her little box.  My claws came out!  Things are fine between us now.  The amazing thing about love is that even when you hate someone momentarily, you still love them deeply.         ",0

I want to start something right now, I don't care if there thousands of miles separating us, but distance matters to her. Nevermind the fact we've known each other for several years. Nevermind the fact we have a connection. There is nothing left for me to do except wait until I move in July. She is bull headed and stubborn, I don't reckon she'll change her mind.

"1830","2162182","Communications-Media","        urlLink Email   --Allow me to be more specific...this is more of a question based on what I consider to be a highly philosophical hypothesis.  I have integrated such a theory into a screenplay and a play, and it is so copyrighted to me.  Don't even think of stealing it, though you are free to pass it around the internet, giving me full credit for posing such a high-class query.  Again, this thought was inspired by the Oscar-snubbed  TimeCop , starring the always venerable Jean-Claude Van Damme:  (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Since this Unconquerable Postulate (TM) was brought out of my memory banks by James over at  urlLink CannedJam , I will use him as my variable .)  Let's us assume that there is James in the year 2003.  James is married and lives in a house.  James somehow finds a way to travel ten (10) years into the future, and does so.  James is now in 2013.  However, James of Ten Years from Now (James-X, we shall call him) and James'ssss Wife of Ten Years From Now (we shall call her Wife-X) both still exist and live in the same location.  Let's say James-X, believing nothing is different in his world, leaves for work at 8AM.  Wife-X is staying home that day.  James of Ten Years Ago (just James in our book) is now living in the same world as James-X and Wife-X.  James locates his house and finds Wife-X inside.  Wife-X is at first frightened but then simply assumes that her now younger-looking husband (who is, unbeknownst to her, actually James) has had a spa treatment, thus obtaining said younger look.  She decides to have sex with him.  James then returns to his time period without ever coming into contact with James-X, which we all well know would result in an immediate implosion of the space-time continuum and end existence as we know it.  Still with me?  Good, me either.  Let's continue.  For whatever reason, James, now safely back in 2003, tells his wife that he went into the future and had sex with her future self, Wife-X.    James-X comes home to find that Wife-X has mistakenly slept with his younger self.  Assuming he takes her story as true (a rather large assumption, but a critical one at this juncture), think about the following, each being one of my Greatest Philosophical Postulates of All Time (TM):  1. If you are James-X, did your wife cheat on you with yourself (yourself being James, the You of Ten Years Ago)?  Are you jealous? 2. If you are Wife, did James cheat on you with yourself (yourself being Wife-X, the Wife of Ten Years From Now)?  Are you jealous? 3. Is there another situation that's funner to think about?  God, sometimes I blow my own mind.  --Along those same lines, I've had this conversation with many before and responses have been all over the board.  This one is for the guys:  Let us say that you have a girlfriend of three years whom you love very much and want to marry.  One day you find out she is having an affair...with another chick.  Are you jealous?  Upset?  Do you end the relationship?  My answers are no, no, and no.  I have thought about this over and over and over and I can't imagine any situation where this makes me anything but more sexually charged.  --I watched Britney on Leno last night.  Honestly, I never thought this day would come, but my affinity for Britney has worn off.  Is she still hot?  Yes.  Would I let her rape me over and over?  Likely.  Does she do it for me like she used to?  Not nearly.  First off, everything she says comes off as contrived and fake.  This is a double-edged sword, because on one hand, if she's fake, that's really bad, and if she's not and actually acts like that always, that's really really bad.  Neither is good basically.  So I'm dropping my 'Let Britney Do Whatever She Wants' protest.  As far as I'm concerned, she's form Pie Country and not worth the time.  (EDITOR'S NOTE:  The size of young Brit's boobies fluctuates more than Oprah's weight and Bush's popularity combined.

Dang...well, instead of trying to narrate everything that's been goin on, here's a nice list :P  -  Installed a surround-sound system at my Grandma's (ok, so maybe it was actually Jay's) - did a very nice job, you can hardly see the wires going all over the place. For anyone in the area - movie night Friday? :) -  Finals week = three all-nighters in four nights.  I forgot how much this time of the year can mess up your sleep schedule; at least I have time to take naps in the afternoons.

Got a $500 scholarship from WPNI and a $600 Pell Grant (allegedly - I haven't seen anything in writing yet).  I should be getting back my financial information from Kent really soon (like next week).  And a lot of people have been saying that they would be willing to help me out with certain things to get ready (one aunt has promised to help me get a suit - not that I particularly want to get one, but it's required :P).  I might yet be able to pull this off... -  Internship = finally finished up my essay (a case study - it was actually pretty hard) and sent it in.  Had my interview today (via phone); it was pretty tough, Chris (the internship coordinator) asked a couple of really hard questions (ex:  'You've been assigned to defend a man accused of sexually molesting a child.  You walk in to interview him and he blurts out that he did it.  Inasmuch as you still are required to defend him to the best of your abilities, could you continue to work on the case knowing this?'  or 'You've been assigned to defend a man accused of killing his roommate.  The police have finished cataloging the crime scene and you go to investigate.  In the course of your investigation you pull back a curtain and find a knife with what looks like blood on it.  What do you do?'  You get the gist of the questions...).  Chris said he would get back to me by sometime next week, so with any luck I'll be all set up for my internship by this time next week :-D -  Washington = found out who my roommates will be and I'm pretty happy with the arrangement.  I've had classes with two of them (there's four of us in a suite) and they're  good guys; the other guy I've had a chance to talk with a couple of times and he seems like a good guy, too (plus, he's originally from inner-city D.C., so I might need to 'buddy up' with him ;) -  Work = finally got to meet the woman who will be taking over for me.  Leilani seems really nice; from her resume and talking with her she seems very competent, but it could be a hectic couple of weeks inasmuch as we're only going to have about 3 weeks to get her up to speed and settled in before I'm gone.  And then there's the whole ISO thing comin up...we're finishing up our internal audit this week, and then we're going to have our Management Review on Saturday...looks like I'm probably gonna be working 50-60 hour weeks over 'break' between getting Leilani ready and getting ready for the ISO audit on Jan. 13. -  Social = like I have a social life ;).  Although I was thinking about it...this is probably totally weird, but it struck me how much I miss saying 'I'm sorry.'  Seriously, I probably haven't had a situation where I could (or should) say it in a couple of months (I'm discounting perfunctory situations like accidentally bumping into someone, etc.); of course, I probably say this because I miss having relationships strong enough to allow me to put myself into a situation where the opportunity to say so exists, not because I miss the actual mecahnics of it.  Plus, there's just something restorative and definitive about responding to 'I'm sorry' situations - the strength of a relationship is usually better described in how it responds to injury than in how it acts in health.  Of course, 'healthy' and 'relationships' are not usually words put into the same sentence with me - come to think of it, 'relationships' isn't a word usually used in discussing me period. -  Girls = like I have a social life :P.  Nada, zippo, nil; get the point?  Ok, so maybe I have some 'ideas,' but I'm not planning on starting anything in the next month before I leave for Washington (Lisa, your suggestions was duly noted and is still being pondered ;).  If anyone has any ideas or references, feel free to contact me. -  Birthday = Yes, I am now even older than I was before (not that that wasn't the case yesterday or the day before that...but you know what I mean).  My rewards for turning 23?  Finally being able to file independently for FAFSA (not that it could re-file apply for next semester anyway) and getting kicked off my family's plan at LifeCenter.  But at least I had two e-cards waiting for me - one from WebShots.com and the other from Netscape.com.  I'm so glad that these corporations as so concerned with my happiness... -  Family = Talk about frustrating.  I'm so disappointed in my relationship with my family right now - I feel like a stranger whenever I go over there any more.  Not that I usually want to go over there - it's nice to be 'home' and all, but it just always seems like I end up mediating a fight.  And my mom is being a real brat lately (or maybe I'm just becoming more aware of it)...sometimes I don't know how my dad puts up with it.  But I was thinking about it the other day, and I think she might be acting that way to get attention (basically, for the same reasons a little kid acts like that); of course, being 'touchy-feely' isn't exactly a strength of my family.  Plus, I think that she might not be taking her meds...and she's been working a lot more lately (she got the job with LifeCenter).  And my perception of my dad has been totally shattered over the past year or so - I used to really look up to him in both a personal and spirital sense, but it seems like every time I'm home my mom is critisizing him, and there's only so much of that you can take before your perception of someone starts to get worn down (especially when some of the criticism is based upon objective facts).  That being said, we got to go out and play some racquetball the other day (I got spanked) - it felt really good to just be able to do somethin with him (not that we could actually do something just he and I - everyone else had to come, and I'm too 'nice' to object - not that I knew everyone else was comin prior to them walking through the door).  And I just hate the 'economic' mindset of things at home - everything is about money or something related to earning money (reputation, credentials, etc.) - I'm just not wired that way, there's other things more important to me than making money, and it just seems like I always get into arguments over my priorities, etc.  (I still don't think they know I'm a closet socialist :P).  Oh, and they could be moving in with my Grandma soon (it's about time, if you ask me)...they're going to try to rent out the house in Hudson.  But at least I'll be in Washington by then... -  Money (Part II) - I've only recently been realizing how much money actually impacts my thinking (and yes, I blame it on my parents) - I almost threw up the other day when it finally hit me how many of my decisions are purely motivated by economic considerations.  But at least I found it somewhat satisfying to realize that the decisions I've made NOT based upon economic considerations are the ones I'm happiest with...hmm, maybe I should take a cue from that? -  Metaphysics = Yes, time to venture into the weirdest parts of the weird world of Mike.  I finally got up the gumption (yes, that IS a word) to talk to Dave (the leader of my Sunday School class) about two of the primary questions I've been having, but I have to admit that he wasn't really much of a help.  I'm still struggling with my 'Christianity Belief Equation' (i.e. God exists --> Jehovah is God --> Jesus is Jehovah), primarily in forming some way of believing the middle assertion (Jehovah is God) based upon some form of rational reasoning.  All I've gotten so far is 'It's just something you just have faith in' (I HATE THAT ANSWER).  Of course, that segways into my second question - inasmuch as salvation is based upon faith and faith is based upon belief, wouldn't it make sense that salvation ceases to exist if belief ceases to be absolute?  Grr...sometimes I wonder why I wonder abou this stuff...I would describe myself as a person with a perpetually troubled spirit - 'tranquility' and 'certain' are not typically words associated with my spiritual state.  So anyway, the question about belief and salvation really troubles me - I've always believed in absolute salvation, but I just don't see how it can be the case if my equation holds true.  And with me questioning the middle principle of my 'Christianity Belief Equation' (and thus the subsequent assertion based upon it), wouldn't that mean that I am in a state of non-salvation?  LOL...just another one of those inconsequential questions I wrestle with all the time...I need to take a cue froim my HS football coach and 'STOP THINKING!!' for my own good ;) ",0
"1833","2153234","Religion","       urlLink click to link to the story  Well, itis monday and I go to class on monday afternoons.  Today I found out the the mission trip I am supposed to take to Haiti has been cancelled.  We were to leave on Sunday but now will not.  It is ok I guess since I have lots of other stuff going on at work and school, but it is really sad that we cannot go.  Certainly now is not the best time to go there since their Govt is struggling so much and the US presence may not help.  The country's problems are so complex that it is difficult to know where to start with help.  I hope you all will add Haiti to the list of concerns that you have for people who need our help in our world and I hope that you will pray.   Pray for two things specifically; 1. that our goventment will be instruments of peace on behalf of concerned americans and christians, 2. that Christians and missionaries who minister in Haiti will be able to return to their posts soon so that they can continue to be the presence of Christ for those people. thanks back with more later in the week  ",0
"1834","2148979","indUnk","           I had to admit to a couple of my friends this week that I am broke.  It must've been because I spent over $575 on shirts, pants, dress boots, and underwear...and that is just the stuff I remember putting on my plastic THIS month.  Ok, enough is enough.  Time to stop medicating my insecurities by spending so much.  *splashes water on face*  When I get home tonight I'm going to make full use of this Microsoft Money software package I received when I bought my computer.  It's no fun looking at a low balance in my bank account.  I justified it by telling myself, hey, at least it's better than having a low sperm count.  I really couldn't help myself this month.  Once I stepped into Chinook Centre all bets were off.  There is something about the environment of that shopping mall that screams 'be one of us...be beautiful...have all of these beautiful women walking the halls for yourself...be the star.'  I swear to God that the mall is alive.  The entrance that I use is beside a hair salon that is full of gorgeous and well-dressed women.  I think that's one of the places where the mall spawns these women from her womb to purposefully torment me.  It was pretty bad 2 weeks ago when I stepped through the glass doors of Mexx to be greeted by this wonderful creature wearing a slim-fitting black skirt and thigh-high CFM boots.  Her blue eyes fell upon me and she didn't flinch.  I could just feel that gaze slipping the credit card out of my wallet.  Oh yeah, she knew exactly what she was doing.  We both made our way to the (clothes rack) bar and had a look at what was on the menu.  She suggested things that were quite unpalatable to me, so I had to guide her to the right places and teach her what I liked.  We both courted each other retail-style, sliding the clothes seductively over the thin changeroom door back and forth, back and forth, gingerly cradling and fondling the garments while having her talk to me when I was in nothing but my briefs and socks.  3 shirts and 1 pair of pants later, my hair is a little messy and each of us is smoking the proverbial cigarette at the sales counter with her asking if it was good for me too.  And no, I didn't call her the next morning.          ",0

"1837","2140839","Marketing","                  Mother's Day  On Mother's Day I joined my mom to visit my dad in the nursing home. I hadn't visited him for months since my mom and him--fairly recently--are embroiled in a legal battle. This has made her bitter and resentful so her visits have become terse and infrequent. Since she's my only ride to this boony off-road home and since she likes to make me happy, she relented to a visit.   We came into his room and I was alarmed at how emaciated he'd become: he was bony and skeletal and I could practically encircle his leg or arm with my hand. His face, to my relief, looked the same though he doesn't wear his bottom dentures anymore, making him look like a gummy old man. He was alert and talkative, and my mom took this opportunity to tell him how much grief he was causing her, but he'd only reply with confused unrelated statements like, 'Did you turn off the radio?' and stubborn butthead-y comments like, 'Fine, then, DON'T visit me anymore!'* While she was talking heatedly he closed his eyes and started snoozing. She continued chastisizing him but he was obviously asleep. I looked at her like, 'This is absurd' and we looked at each other and realized how ridiculous it all was and laughed because it was all we could do. I said, 'Well, we better go.'  *(My dad doesn't talk like a teenage girl; I do, and unfortunately I'm the translator here.)  We drove down to Redwoodcity to visit my ailing gramma and aunt and we sat down to a meal of 'goi cuon' with my cousins. This is where you wet a round sheet of rice paper, fill it with pork, shrimp, cilantro, mint, chive, lettuce and rice noodles, roll it up, and dip it in hoisin sauce and eat it. The key is to not overload your rice paper thus turning it into gigantic 'burrito roll' or the defeated 'soft taco.' Your aim is to roll one that is uniform in size and shape, perfectly cylindrical like a sizable egg roll.   I started with a poor open-ended one resembling a big lettuce bouquet and my bro's GF made little lumpy ones tapered at the ends that resembled jumbo doobies. By my fourth and final roll, I'd mastered it, but I was already full. For dessert we picked at a cheesecake from Cala Foods then we went home.                ",0
"1838","2140839","Marketing","                  *** Mi Taqueria Amor   Sometimes before Spanish class I duck into El Farolito on 24th & Mission to treat myself to a burrito. (Class is boring. Eating is exciting.) When I lived around there last year, the cashier was this tall 40-something dark-skinned man with a bulbous bumpy nose. He was scruffy and rugged and looked like he loved to live hard. He was always moving and talking at frenetic speeds like he was on drugs. I imagined that on his breaks he'd do blow with the cooks. Lately, though, the cashier has been a tall 30's-ish man whose face reminds me of Dopey Dwarf. He has big child-like saucer eyes, pale skin, and a saintly expression: calm, pleasant, and maybe a little amused. Maybe he was a little amused because the first time I ordered with him I chirped, 'Super Sesos Burrito, por favor.' (Beef Brains. Not a typical order, I bet.) I enjoy his placid demeanor and he has nice teeth too. He smiles alot. I imagine that afterwork he likes to write poems.                   ",0
"1839","2140839","Marketing","                   urlLink BMI   Yesterday I went to the doctor and she suggested I lose some weight. She sent me home with a BMI chart with my position circled. I'm in the grey area which equals 'medium-risk for potential health problems.' My pants have been getting snug, but I've blamed it on shrinking pants. I assume when one pair shrinks, they're all in on it, so they all shrink together. When I stood on the scale and the nurse kept tapping the square thingy further up til I weighed 17 lbs more than I normally weigh, I assumed it was my wallet and my shoes. When I was at my mother's house and she suggested we try her scale and it read the same weight, I immediately assumed I had a 17-lb ulcer or a massive goiter hidden somewhere (most likely my huge gut).   So anyway, I'm going to try to lose some weight, but not without resistance and plenty of whining. Yesterday I left my mom's house at 8:30 citing 'tiredness' and she goes, 'What? You're so young! Why are you tired?' and I said jokingly, 'I'm FAT mom! Fat people get TIRED easily!'             ",0
"1840","2140839","Marketing","                  What I Did This Weekend  This weekend my little cousin Kiwi flew up from Orange County and stayed with us. Entertaining guests always makes me a bit more active because I want to ensure they have a good time in SF. On Friday night we had drinks at the Hukilau with Green Marble's crew and on Saturday, we ate sushi at No-name, went to Japantown, caught the  urlLink Triplets of Belleville  at the Red Vic, then went to a party at my cousin's house.    My cousins were hosting a Mexican-themed party at their triplex/compound. (I'm really into that Mexican dish where it's meat and corn on the bottom and a layer of cornbread is baked on top? What's that called? Cuz I really like it.) My cousin, Duck-duck, likes to cook and her food is always delicious because the ingredients are fresh and she provides a smorgasboard of variety each time: there was that cornbread dish, enchiladas, carnitas, grilled chicken cubes, and all the fixins  plus  artichoke dip. For dessert she made rhubarb crisp and baked a mocha cake in honor of Abby's bday. She put candles on it and we processed into the living room singing 'Happy Birthday' and it was funny because Abby was singing and looking around to see whose birthday it was. When she realized we were singing to her, she was really embarrassed. Hee-hee! Abby and I went home around midnight and fell asleep watching SNL.   On Sunday we went to see  urlLink 13 Going on 30 , which is actually pretty good for what it is. Afterwards we split up to spend Mothers' Day with our mommies. More on my mother's day later.

We didn't fall head over heels, like we did for the one on Chicago and the one on Welty - but this house is BIG and in our price range and has most of what we're looking for.  Only downside is that it's in a neighborhood with status TBA.  Chicago and Welty are both nice, stable, fairly quiet neighborhoods.  Summit (the new house) is right across the street from a hospital and a gas station - but right up the street from a school.  It's almost too good to be true - and honestly the neighborhood isn't any worse than where we are right now.  So it's a thought.   urlLink Jen  came dinner and we ate on the porch - taco salad.

So, I insert my disk, pull up its contents, load up my paper...  ...and discover that the version that's on the disk is an old, incomplete version of the paper.  Dammit.  That totally kills my ability to work on the damn thing, because I don't remember what corrections/adjustments/changes I've made since this version was made.  I've got the most recent version saved on my computer back at the apartment, but that really doesn't help me in the next three and a half hours of work.  Dammit.  Beyond that, things aren't too bad.  There's the distinct possibility that I will own the Opinion page in tomorrow's  urlLink school newspaper , with both a comic and an article about the state of pop music.  The comic is virtually guaranteed, the article is still in question.  We'll see what happens.  Could be fun if it ends up in there.  In other news, I am listening to Led Zeppelin, the greatest straight rock band ever (the Beatles are pop-rock, and in a genre all their own.  Zep is straight ahead, no holds barred rock and roll).  Their fourth album, known colloquially as 'Zoso' (for one of the symbols in its inocuous title), is one of the greatest albums ever committed to a sound recording.  Every song on it is a classic, with the exception of the boring and just plain blah 'Battle of Evermore,' which of course runs on for much longer than it has any business or reason to last.  But we can forgive that, because it has 'Black Dog,' 'Rock and Roll,' 'Stairway to Heaven,' 'Going to California,' 'Misty Mountain Hop,' and 'When the Levee Breaks.'  Those six songs, along with the acceptable 'Four Sticks,' make this an amazing album (how many CDs in the past decade or so can you say at least 3/4 of was absolutely brilliant?  I thought so).

"1852","2087401","Student","       Marten, was this one of those 'Hey, Thomas do you think?' polls? 'Cause Nate and I don't remember being polled either.  As long as I'm posting, it's time for the State report-LN version.  We recieved 6th place, a seemingly bad spot.  In fact, though, we were 2nd place in marching to Avon by 3/4 of a point and third in music.  We were only 6th because we were eighth in general effect, and that could be attributed to our band being very small compared to the others.  This made us too quiet for the dome and ruined the pianissimos at the beginning and end of the show, which contributed to the low effect score.  So really, the score isn't so bad considering what we had against us. We still should have beat Carmel.  But we were winners anyway, because we drink milk.  In other news I'm wearing a birthday hat.

"1853","2087401","Student","       School is wearying.  Another wasted srt. That Career Day was the most waste of time thing that I have ever been to. I signed up for Government/Social Services and Performing Arts/Arts.  Well the first one that I went to was the government. Or so I thought... It turns out that they had gotten and a policeman and a fireman to come to educate about two careers that I will go into when hell freezes over.  The only uplifting part is that the policeman whipped out his, I know what  you're thinking and your wrong, taser.  He turned it on briefly then tucked it back in it's holster. 'I think we should liven thinks up a bit and ask the police officer to taser the fireman'-Michael.  Mercifully, that bit ended at the end of first session.  Little did I know the horrors that were waiting for me in the LGI Room.  At the time, I was relieved that we might actually learn something useful. After all, Performing Arts is sort of my thing.  So there we were, Carl Cote, Mark Yates. Then, to our horror, the women introduces herself as a 'Landscapist.' Naturally all three of us were like 'WTF MATES?!' A general murmur of what the hell, this isn't art arose from the disquieted audience. Well she went on to explain that there was somewhat of a link between landscaping and art. I could sort of understand this, so I figured this must be the Art part of Performing Arts/Arts. We sat through her presentation politely, and eventually, it was time for the next speaker to come on. We figured that this would be a vocalist or some other sort of musician. We were dead wrong. I seem to recall her opening line as 'I know that this clinic said performing arts, but I am going to stick to the regular art.' Regular art?! HA! She was a fucking (excuse my language, but it is called for) interior designer. The crowd was shocked. A slow quiet came over the whole room as we realized that we were about to receize a 20 minute lecture on interior design. Luckily for us, we had Mark's digital camera and entertained ourselves by taking pictures of Carl's feet in various positions. Contact Mark Yates if you want copies. Don't get me wrong, we did try to leave, but my counselor decided at that moment to sell her soul to the devil and block our only exit. At the end, there was a time open for questions. The first was asked by Ghetto McGhettoson (name changed to protect the innocent). It was as follows: 'What the hell? This isn't performing arts!  What instrument do ya'll play?' Then my demon-filled counselor made weak statements about the name saying bother performing arts and arts, and that they chose to focus on art. Art? Art my ass. Interior Designing does not cut it for a room full of people from the LC music department. My imp of a councelor ended up asking the vast majority of the questions. She is going to have to answer to the students, and it will not be a pretty site.  [Not a pretty site? Will it be webcast? --Michael]   Will I ever go willingly to another Career Day at LC? I think not. There will have to be some serious grade reduction to force me to go...  Anywho, on to Chicago. It was wonderful! We stayed at this nice hotel downtown called 'Club Quarters.' It had an awesome location, and everything was in walking distance. On Friday night, we went to the symphony and heard the Chamber Orchestra of Europe play 'Midsummer's Night Dream' by Menddehlson, and quite a few selections from Bach. It was freaking awesome. At the beginning, their intonation was slightly off, but they really locked it in quickly and for the rest of the night. The applause at the end was humorous. The director, Andras Schiff, came back out like six times, and even had the symphony play an encore. Some of the members looked startled at the blast of applause even. Also, someone in the orchestra has the greatest name ever. 'Nimrod.'   On Saturday morning, we went to the Art Institute of Chicago to see the Rembrandt exhibit. It was good and everything, but it didn't really 'touch me' as some would say. Not enough color, and too many faces. He seems like he was a really serious guy. I much prefer things like Van Gogh and Manet. After that, we drove home. I got to drive about 3/4 of the distance, which was great! Hurry for learners permits! Well, that about wraps up this post. Oh ya, I watched Blues Brothers recently, and my new explanation for everything I do is 'We're on a mission from God' in that awesome Dan Akroyd Chicago accent. Oh by the way Erin, May is lusty? I didn't know that months had emotion and feelings!? Oh well, you learn something new everyday. Good Night! I sleep now!  -It is his love, it is his life, it is his fault he didn't lock the garage!    ",0

"1856","2069530","indUnk","                 World Undone Prelude  My dear friend, we have missed each other for a long time. I remember the day exactly, when you and I parted. I had been preparing for weeks on end. The hour before you came, I was in your house, making all of the final touches.  I ran ribbons up and down the hallways and pressed them tight with paste, and wrote your name on them over and over. I felt that I was doing a tremendous job. When at last you arrived, you would see what a good deed I had done, and call me a very nice person.  I strung ribbons of all different colors throughout each room. I pulled them up over the furniture and through the doorways, and made little tassels which I hung out the window. It was all to celebrate your arrival.  Most of the ribbons were white, and most of them were about as wide as my index finger. I glued them all over your house. I covered your ceiling and your floors, and wrapped them around your ceiling fan and wove them through your air conditioning vents. I wrote your name on each one. I used a big staple gun to hang them like streamers in the doorways and over the television. You were going to be so excited when you got home.  I tied bows on all of your forks and knives. I scrawled your name across your best serving spoon, which was wrapped tightly in violet and baby blue. I made little ribbon puffs and stapled them to your favorite chair. You were going to be so happy.   Then you came home. You opened the door and saw the ribbons. You smiled a great big smile that showed all of your teeth. Your eye's turned into gold coins. Your lips were strawberry twists. Your whole face became a marshmallow. One by one, each of your features became like candy. Your eyes were chocolate. Your legs turned into peppermint sticks. Your hair became cotton candy. The whole shape of your body became abstract. Slowly, slowly, you fell into a pile on the floor.   I turned on the radio, which was covered in tiny pink bows. The music was like a saw beating against a metal box. It had no melody. The ribbons fell around my head and I screamed. I picked up the phone to call the doctor, but the man on the other end was playing a slide whistle. I began to cry. A jingle came on the radio. It was one you used to dance to.   Mr. Lucky's Cherry Cough Syrup. One teaspoon will calm your throat, two will make you glad, four will make you see nice things, and eight will drive you mad. Mr. Lucky's cherry cough syrup.     Though still in peices, you took to a rythmic movement. You scattered while you were dancing, and danced right into the grates, right through the ribbons with which I had so caringly decked them. You danced right into the ventilation system.  Your house turned into a space ship. I did not know that your house had space ship capabilities. I heard your voice speak.   'Oh yes, my house has spaceship capabilities,' you said. I did not know that people that had turned into candy could read minds. Where ever your house was going, I did not want to follow, so I leapt out of the window.  The ground caved in below me. It turned into liquid. I swam to the top, and I heard a voice calling my name. I tried to turn around but a man with dead tree branches for hands was knocking on my head. I asked him to stop, and his eyes turned red.   'I'm sorry, I have red eyes,' he said. 'I'm actually a very nice man, but sometimes my eyes glow red. It is hereditary. I didn't mean to scare you.'  I'm not sure if I believed him or not, but all the same I made distance between us. I looked up to where the house had been. What I had thought was a spaceship was really nothing. There was no sign of a house. I was standing at the edge of a lake. Nothing that I had just seen was there, although I knew that it was there.  I cupped my hands over my mouth and whispered your name. I heard a loud echo over the lake, which disrupted a flock of birds. As I watched them fly up into the sky, I noticed that they were carrying the ribbons. Each bird grasped a bunch of the ribbons which were tangled like a giant net. Clouds of ribbon hung from the mess. I began running toward them.   I ran swiftly, tripping over rocks and sticks, but never falling. I felt a hard smack against my whole body. I had run into the man with branches for arms. The birds flew away with the ribbons, and I watched them, and I sobbed. I sat down on the ground, and the man hugged me.   'Although this all seems terrible,' he said, 'This is really a lot like a dream, isn't it?'  'Yes,' I answered, 'It is an awful lot like a dream. Is it a dream after all?'  The man looked at me. His eyes were like glowing embers. It seemed as though he could tell I didn't like it and was trying to tone them down.   'No,' he said to me, 'This is not a dream, but you must act like it is, for the reality of this world is melting away.'  I asked him, 'What shall I do?'  'You must stop it from happening,' he said, 'You must discover where the fire is.'  He told me that whatever was destroying reality was coming either from the outside or the inside, but no one could tell.   'How long?' I asked, 'How long have we been falling apart?'  'Many years,' said the man, 'You, yourself, have participated in the bizzarities of our transformation, with out even knowing it. Without even knowing it... You, yourself have become a part of this melting candle of a universe. How did you figure that ribbons were what a person wanted?'  'They love ribbons,' I told him.  I could not remember who you were. I knew that you were either a man or a woman. I knew that I had spoken to you before, and that you had spoken to me, and that you had a name, for I had whispered it beneath my cupped hands just a few moments before, and the lake had screamed it back to me.  I asked the man, â€œDid you hear me calling a name over the lake?â€ Perhaps he would remember.   â€œI can hear nothing,â€ said the man, â€œBut what this profane world allows me to hear. I am so much one of its members; I am beginning to turn into a part of its forest.â€  It was then that I understood that the fire he had spoken of was inside of him. I told him this.   â€œThere is a fire burning,â€ I said, â€œAnd when I look at you, I see it.â€  The fire in the manâ€™s eyes leapt about. One eye went dark. The other burned brightly, splashing its colors over his face, as if it could not be controlled, even by him. He began to swat at it, but immediately ceased, remembering that his arms were made of wood.  â€œI am not a bad man,â€ he repeated, â€œI was born this way.â€  There was a path that started at my feet. It seemed to lead through a forest, but as I walked, the forest around me was cleared away without ever moving. My head felt light, and I wondered if I was not walking around a loop that went up-side-down, and over, and landed me right where I had started. If there was a power that led me, it would lead me right next to myself. I stepped off of the path and wandered through the shallow edges of the lake. Suddenly it occurred to me that I was alone. I turned back. I wanted to call for the man with branches for arms, but I did not know his name. I wondered about you. I began to think that perhaps he and you were one in the same.   I shouted, â€œHey! Man!â€ I still could not remember your name. I heard the shuffle of his feet, and ran away. I ran for quite some time. I ran until I was out of breath, and more thirsty than I had ever been in my life. I looked down, searching for the lake, but it was not there. I felt pangs of hunger. I had not eaten or drank in several hours. Something near me moved, and I looked up. I saw a face before me. Its eyes were burning. It was my face, and I was gazing into a mirror.   â€œIt is inside us,â€ I heard a voice say. I turned around, and saw nothing. I was spinning, trying to find the source of the voice. It was my voice, for I had spoken my thoughts out loud. I turned to the mirror again. It had no sides. It was solid, but feathered out into space from the middle, so that it gradually became nothing as one moved towards the edges, like a picture fading into white. Around me was a field.   â€œThere are rabbits in this field,â€ I said. â€œThere must be. Rabbits live in fields. They live in warrens under the ground in fields. There is life under me. There are insects and moles and larva waiting for the proper time to reveal themselves. This is not a lifeless field.â€ I said this because it was my greatest fear, that I had been mystically quarantined from life because of what I knew.  I closed my eyes, trying to snuff out the fire with my lids. The man had seen them all along and was trying to protect me from the truth. He had been born with it, he said. I had acquired it. I tried to remember your name again. I wanted to go back and find the man, for I was all alone, but I did not know where to turn.   Opposite of the mirror, said a voice in my head. That is where I came from. First I had to find the mirror again. It was there, before me. I looked into it again, and felt enormous grief and fear. I wondered if I should venture to look at the other side. What is on the other side of a reflection? I looked. Blackness. Blackness absorbs light, but it absorbs all light. Mirrors only reflect enough light to make a picture, so the back of one aught to absorb only enough light to serve the same function. I gazed into the dark. It shifted, changing to my reasoning. I saw a negative image of myself.  Is that how it works now? I thought. Then the man with the branch arms should be standing next to me.   He was.   I asked him, â€œHow did you get here?â€  â€œI get many places,â€ he said, â€œand I have never asked why. I go, and I arrive. The dynamics are without reason.â€  â€œThey are not,â€ I said, â€œI reasoned you here.â€ So I could reason, and it would be done.   At first I felt powerful. I began to reason all of the things that I wanted at that moment. I reasoned that I should have food, drink, and comfort. I had food and drink, but they were nothing I had ever seen before. The food was the raw heart of an animal, and the drink was green and bitter.   I said aloud, â€œIt goes to reason that I should have crab-cakes and snap peas with rice, and that I should have a glass of water and a glass of white wine.â€  I had these things. How specific I had to be. While I was eating I talked to the man. I spoke like someone who was seeing an old friend for the first time in years. Through chewed greens I prattled on about my new finding.  â€œWhy, with this power,â€ I exclaimed, spitting tiny darts of food, â€œI could make everything the way it should be. I could put buildings where there were buildings, and streets around them with people walking on them. I could think houses and yards with tree stumps and bushes along the fence, and people inside of them reading to their children and playing games, and schools with teachers, and factories and stores. I could make everythingâ€¦â€  â€œâ€¦The way it used to be,â€ finished the man.  When he spoke, I glanced upwards, just to see his face, but I saw that behind him, buildings had grown, as if from the ground. Streets had been built. Houses were in the distance. Everything that had once been seemed to be again. I leapt for joy. I was so pleased that I hugged the man, and then jumped up and ran towards the city. As I approached it I could make out some details, such as the striped socks on a child, and tags jingling on the collar of a running dog, and a label on a bottle of whisky that had been discarded on the street.   The street signs, however, had no names on them. Some of them did, like the signs for the larger streets with names that I could remember, but as I walked through the neighborhoods, many of the signs had nothing on them, or else all was gibberish that I did not understand. A woman in a sweatshirt walked by, pushing a baby carriage. Her hair was dark, and her facial features were sharp. The same woman walked by again on the next street. This time she was wearing a dress and she was blonde. She pushed the same carriage. As I brushed past the carriage, I peered into it slyly. It was empty. When she had passed, I turned to watch her go. I noticed the buildings behind me had started to melt. I turned around and the houses and trees before me had, also. They stopped when I looked at them. They started again when I turned away.   I looked for the man with the branch arms again.   â€œThis is what you wanted,â€ he said calmly, â€œNo one else wanted this. I brought your food.â€ He held up the heart, and the nasty green potion.  â€œWhat do they want?â€ I asked.   â€œMany things,â€ he said, â€œEach person wants something different.â€  I looked around for you, although I still could not remember what you looked like. Where ever you were, you were making a world for yourself too. The woman walked by again, this time in a black suit. Her hair was red. Her face was familiar. It was the face of someone off of a television commercial, or a soap ad, or a picture I had seen once â€“ only now, she wasnâ€™t anybody. As I was thinking about her, the city began to wane, and as I stood in the midst of it I began to wish for real things.   â€œMan,â€ I said to the man, as I had yet to ask his name, â€œWhy are you the only other one besides me who is really here?â€  â€œMy name,â€ answered the man, â€œIs Mr. Pearl. I have told you that several times.â€  Horrors chilled my heart. I had seen this man before and forgotten him. I had conversed with him, exchanged names with him, and he had escaped my memory completely. I gazed into the distance to clear my mind. The city dissolved before me in slow motion. The roofs of the buildings slid down the walls in gummy masses. Beneath it, like an old painting, was the field.   â€œI came to you through the field,â€ remarked Mr. Pearl.   I asked him, â€œWho does the field belong to?â€ He sighed gently and shifted his body.  â€œA man who remembers grass,â€ he said, â€œAll day long he looks into his field. He does not waste energy on what belongs there. He just concentrates on that grass. He remembers that green grass should be beautiful.â€  â€œThere is no dirt beneath it?â€  â€œThere is no dirt beneath it,â€ confirmed Mr. Pearl.   â€œI cannot dig a hole in that field?â€  â€œYou cannot dig a hole in his field,â€ he smiled, I believe, for the first time, â€œYou can walk on his field, an if you do that you can walk right to him, but if you walk through your own city, you can walk for ever and ever and never see a soul.â€  â€œI see you,â€ I said, â€œand I can see myself if there is a mirror.â€  He smiled again, â€œHow good of you to see a mirror.â€ His eyes were dim and placid. They were smoky, but beneath the smoke, I thought I could see real eyes. He felt out the ground with his stick fingers, and scooped up a clump of dirt and grass. A worm wriggled out from between his fingers. He held the moist dirt to his face and breathed deeply through his nose, then offered it to me to imitate his actions, but I declined.   â€œI was waiting for this day, a long time ago. Once this world of ours was so far gone, I used to see you walking the way I do, and I thought, there is someone like me! But you never could remember my nameâ€¦â€ He was at ease now, as though a rock had been removed from his stomach, and in his eyes I could see his humanity. His eyes were deep blue â€“ eyes that could put out fires. He still held the clump of dirt.  â€œThis is the earth,â€ he said. A tear started down his cheek and, as he could not wipe it away, continued to his chin, making its way through a maze if stubble, and seeped into a crease in his neck.  He continued,â€This spot of earth is a straggler, like us. Itâ€™s real. I didnâ€™t think there was anything left.â€  I asked him, â€œWhat shall we do?â€  â€œWe mustnâ€™t assume that this is the very last,â€ he said, to much in awe to answer my question. The place where we were was a lot like the beginning, you see. Once there was a man, a woman, and an unsullied piece of land. So it begins, I thought, and so it ends. He saw me thinking this, and then considered my question.  â€œWe cannot cast aside what we have already become a part of. We must move. We can base our map on this piece of land, for if we stand in the center, we will see that there are unchanging directions, not like the world out there. You go east, and Iâ€™ll go west. Find everyone you can who is willing, and bring them back here.â€  â€œWalk into their worlds?â€ I said.  â€œWalk into their worlds and keep your own,â€ he stammered, â€œto your own.â€ I could see that he was nervous; Life had finally come true for him, but his excitement was fearless. As he walked in the opposite direction, I saw the world loosen its grip on him, and his whole body become like the flesh of a man.   I walk through this place the way my friend Mr. Pearl did. I must treat it like a dream, for it has no true reason. I search for you, and though I realize that I cannot bring back the memory of who you are, I will know you by the world in which you have enveloped yourself. If you are willing, I will guide you to a place where there is land below us and Time ahead. It is a meager share of what once was, but it is very real.                ",0

"1860","2055017","Religion","            NASCAR Would Be Proud: The Unmaking of a Bad Driver   An Essay    I canâ€™t drive. There, I said it. What tends to be an impossible feat for men has just been doneâ€¦in writing: an admission of failure. Some might view this in the same context of an apology, although as a male human being, I could never admit to such a thing. Could this go without saying? Probably.   So, why bring this up? After all, apologies and admissions of failure are touchy subjects with men, unless they happen to be gay of course. In that case, those men have already boldly defied societyâ€™s view on what they think a man should be, so I will exempt them from this horribly stereotypical view on the male ethos here.   At twenty-four years old, I have now been driving for nearly a decade. In my first five years of driving, not once did I get a ticket. Did that mean that I was an excellent and cautious driver? Not in the least. As a matter of fact, I donâ€™t really know how Iâ€™m still alive now. My best guess is that God had found some grace in me and allowed me the vehicular mistakes, until He finally was fed up and said, â€œOh, wonâ€™t somebody just pull this moron over!â€   And so, finally somebody did. And then again. And again. And again. After much soul searching, I think I have it figured out. When I drive alone, I am indeed, a model citizen. Cars, motorcycles, pets, and even pedestrians are all safe when I drive alone. I rarely speed (to say I never speed would be a horrible lie), I obey all traffic signs, and I am often courteous enough to allow other cars and trucks to share the freeway with me (again, to say I always do this would make me a liar).   Even when music is playing, I seem to drive quite normally. Not quite a Driverâ€™s Ed teacher, but normal nonetheless.  When I drive with people, however, none of the above rules apply. Itâ€™s not that I have this defiant nature in which government laws do not apply to me. Itâ€™s more along the lines of not being able to â€œwalk and chew gum at the same time.â€ Amazingly enough, I actually can walk and chew gum at the same time, so donâ€™t write me off as hopeless yet. Itâ€™s more defined as â€œnot being able to drive and talk to/entertain passengers while checking my voice mail messages on my cell phone and adjusting the CD player all at once.â€  After all, being able to do all of these things at once is what makes us American men, right? I canâ€™t count myself so lucky yet. In nine years of driving, I am fortunate enough to say Iâ€™ve only been in four wrecks, only three of which were actually my fault.   Hereâ€™s a nice tidbit of knowledge: if you are so tired that you think there may actually be a good chance of falling asleep at the wheel, in the best interest of those whose time (and fender) you undoubtedly will waste, please donâ€™t drive! Been there, done that, got the T-Shirt!   Twice!  I could take this opportunity to address how silly other countries might view Americans who drive while talking into a [wireless] telephone that was obviously invented to keep us from actually communicating to each other  in person . How silly and pretentious we must look to them.  But, I wonâ€™t go there. Instead, I will assume full responsibility of my failures as an American driver. I must accept the fact that I will never be a fast enough driver to be the next Jeff Gordon, and Iâ€™ll never be careful enough to be a valet.  Maybe I should just stick to what my calling is on the road with other people: a good back seat passenger who can let his annoying phone ring as loudly as he wants. I think that decision will bring all Americans a step closer to unity.   Oh, and for all you stereotypical men: please forgive my apology.               ",0

"1864","2045814","indUnk","           Well here's my random thought of the day.  Colette a few days ago asked me if on the first day of school last year I wore green pants and a purple velvety shirt. She really believes that. No. No. And no way I would wear that, even with the poor dress sense I had back then (and it was poor: I looked a lot like my sister. Sweatpants and sweaters with ugly sweatervests over the top...) But that just got me thinking about how much what I wear affects what people think of me. I have 'homeschooler clothes' that people don't care for if I try to wear them.  Like the other day. I wore this smithsodian tshirt from when I was like eight... It has a space suit with all the names of the space suit parts written on it. No one liked that shirt, but I don't see what's so different from wearing a power rangers or strawberry shortcake shirt from when you were little. I just read books instead of watching TV.  I'm lucky I ended up with the group of friends I have (and yes, this is pertinatant) because people really judge you for what your wearing the first week or so. I could have ended up with some bad people... and then I most likely wouldn't have come back this year.  And if I hadn't come back this year, I would have given up and been homeschooled for the rest of my high school career. So really, what I wore (purple and green if you want to believe it) the first day of school affected my education for life.  I just got lucky.          ",0

"1866","2043336","Arts","           It must be the company that I keep. Recently I've been very upset at the sight of people littering, and I've been dealing with litter situations like I'm 6'2' and 190lbs. If I had a goatee and played the tuba I'd be the spitting image of my dear friend  urlLink The Armchair Garbageman .  Behaving like a hulk of a man is something that I just shouldn't do.  I was with my fiance the other day and saw this punk chuck litter on the floor of the Eaton's Centre.  Something in me came loose, and I swiveled on my heel and caught up to the offender.  B- (tapping the punk on the shoulder)'Hey buddy!  You want to pick up the litter that you threw on the floor back there?' A- (surprised, not impressed)'Who the fuck are you?  A mall cop?' B- 'No, I'm somebody that doesn't want to walk through your trash; who the fuck are you to throw garbage on the floor?' A- 'So what?  You want me to go pick it up?' B- 'I'd really appreciate it if you did.'  At this point he became very agitated.  He was either: A)very embarrassed and trying to think of the right words to apologise; B)trying to think of a clever way to avoid having to pick up the garbage; C)wondering whether to use his left or his right fist to punch a hole in my face. Or perhaps, D)all of the above.  He paced back and forth in front of me like a caged tiger, then came right up to my face and delivered his ultimatum.  A- 'Okay.  Okay.  I'll pick it up.  Where is it?  Show me.'  I felt like saying, 'Jeez, it took you long enough!'  Instead, I pointed to the garbage on the floor and said, 'Right there, buddy.'  A- 'I'm not your fucking buddy!'  Fine.  Then, a light goes on in his head.  A- 'Follow me outside.  I want you to see me throw this out.  Just come with me  outside , yeah?' B- 'Hey, if you tell me that you're going to throw it out I believe you.  I didn't call you a  liar , I called you a  litterbug !' A- 'You know, I could throw you down on the floor in, like,  two seconds  and embarrass you, but I'm not going to do that!' B- 'Fine, fine.  Hey, I'm just glad that you picked up your garbage.'  And I waved my little condescending wave, the one I reserve for jerks I bother while in a moving vehicle or on the other side of a pane of glass, and chalked another one up for our beautiful city.  He left, up the escalator, hopefully to use that street level garbage can that he had so desperately wanted to show me.  Along with my clean streets vigilantism, I've decided to eat my vegetables so that I can grow up big and strong, and become an 'environmental champion' just like   urlLink Woodsy Owl . In the future, I'd prefer if punks just said 'Ye-ye-yes, sir!  Right away, sir!' and got their damn litter without all the drama.  And lastly, in an effort to pattern myself after my hero even more completely, my 'wise request' will forever be. . . 'Give two shits, don't toss garbage where I sits!'  Instead of a forest ranger, I'll be a litter pirate!         ",0

I was really really looking forward to it, and then she called this morning and told me she had decided on a movie... The Ring. I was not too happy at this pronouncement, and called her back to say that I'd heard it was really scary, and I don't like scary movies, and I know she doesn't either. Unfortunately she was rushing out the door to school, so I don't think my arguments were really sufficient, due to the  fact that she was telling me throughout the whole phone call (in a very rushed tone) that she had to go to school. Dad told me that it wasn't a horror movie, that it was a thriller. (He actually hasn't seen the movie) but anyway WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE??? Maybe a thriller is like a half horror movie, so I'd say a movie like signs was a thriller, and all the reviews agreed that The ring was a horror movie, so I am 'coincidentally' not looking forward to the party so much as I was before.

I'm willing to bet she was doing her stupid little victory dance while she talked to me. Ellen can be a little unprofessional, but we overlook it because she's good - about as good as they come. I was sure she'd do fine with the girl's parents, but that doesn't mean she'd be happy about it. So I got it out of the way pretty fast. Told her there was a complication; tried to explain, but of course she wouldn't hear it. 'And there was no way you could have caught him alone!?! Greg, you moron, she could cause big waves. Suppose she goes and tells her parents, or the cops. Do you know who's gonna have to put out these fires, Greg? I'll give you a hint, it isn't you!' 'Actually,' I cut in, 'I thought you could start on the fire thing now. We need to get to her parents somehow. You got the database handy?' 'Yes,' she seethed. 'Same high school as Ian, first name Scarlett.' 'There's two.' 'Check the mugs. Red hair, she has a mole on her cheek.' 'Got it. I have tickets to a show tonight. If I miss it you're paying.' Click. Well I looked at Marcus, and he looked at me and he finally said, in the stupid question of the year, 'How'd it go?' 'Well how'd you think it went? She's ballistic, but she'll be over it in an hour. We got anybody else on the list?' 'Chip's taking care of the other guy, so that just leaves one thing.' 'Who? Where? I need the data man.' And then he stopped walking. He looked at me in a funny way and he said. 'Look, Greg, This is weird, but, it's you.' 'I'm being recruited?' 'Yep.' 'But I'm a recruiter!' 'Yep.' 'WHAT!?!' 'C'mon Greg, you fit the profile. Dissatisfied with your job, but out of other options, little to no social life, --' 'But I've already done this! It didn't work the first time! If this is your idea of a joke.' 'Greg, this is right from the top, you  will  be a recruit on this mission,' he said gravely, 'Here's your time and place. Don't wear the suit.' And we just stood there, he and I.

Now our apartment is entirely too quiet so Chris has decided to run his power tools to help mask the void.  Ruthie (Chris's mom), Cacky (his sister), and Savannah (Cacky's youngest at 16 months) came in on Thursday afternoon.  Once they got here, we visited a bit and made dinner.  Then we had us a little ceremony of sorts.  When Chris's grandmother passed away, they divided her belongings amongst the children.  In the end, they had some of her jewelry that they turned into rings for the granddaughters - and I got one, too.  Mine is a ruby that came from a 40-Anniversary wedding gift that her husband gave her.  It's so pretty and I'm very touched that I was included cause one day, I hope to have a little girl to pass along the ring.  I love sentimental gifts.  They mean more than any expensive gift in some bright shiny store.  Chris also received his granddaddy's walking cane and some of his watches.  During their stay, we hit Chinatown up to Prince Street, Columbus Circle, Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Central Park (picnic), Rockefeller Center/Midtown area, Jeckyl & Hyde Club, City Lobster & Crab Company, The Brooklyn Diner, Ricky's (adult store - and yes, purchases were made but those stories shall be told another time), The Upright Citizens Brigade, and shopping, shopping, shopping & shopping!!!

He's currently taking out his aggression on one of my chairs.  The bastard.  By the way, I will be changing the layout soon to something that everyone can read.

Actually, the most interesting that came out of this entire experience was the colossal fight that broke out between my mother and I.  We haven't really spoken in the last three days because she chose not to let me go see Katie in the hospital that night.  I was so angry that I said a lot of things that, though harsh, I don't regret even now in all of our silence.  True, children normally shouldn't talk to their parents in the way that I did, but it had to be said.

I'm thinking, come on! 3 day weekend, until I realised just how sick I was. It liyterally took me 4 hours on Saturday morning just to muster the strength to get a glass of water, which I promptly threw back up after drinking. Feelin' fine now, mind. So... didn't get much done this weekend, save a lot of movie watching. So how 'bout some film reviews?      It was a choice in the shop between this and  Once Upon A Time In Mexico , and I wish I hadn't chosen this. Not that it's a bad movie, it just isn't all that great. But as the box office will tell ya, put two of the coolest actors in Hollywood (Jackson and Farrell) together on the poster looking mean, and you've got a hit, regardless of whether it's good or not. Is it me, or has Samuel L Jackson not done a really good film since  Unbreakable ? This is also comfortably the worst film I've seen Colin Farrell in.  The problem with the movie is that it clings so tightly to Hollyowood Summer Blockbuster conventions that it just leaves you bored, your only thoughts of interest being 'Hmm, I wonder which of the gang will die / turn evil next'. Let's go down the checklist, shall we?    Maverick / 'loose cannon' cop?  Check. Farrell & partner disobey police orders in the first scene, leaving them in the unforgiving hands of....   Arsehole 'can't wait for you to fail' Chief of Police, who everyone hates?  Oooh yes. Thus we get lots of 'You play by the rules, or you're off the force' style arguments. Yay!   Woman cop?  Fo' sure. Woman SWAT cop, no less (Michelle Rodriguez, aka Hollywood's top scowler). And of course, everyone is surprised everytime they meet her. Because she's a woman. Do they not go to the fucking cinema?   Eurovillain?  D'ya even have to ask? This time we get Olivier Martinez (best known for shagging Kylie), who does little else but reek of Gallic arrogance in every scene.   Ridiculously over the top end sequence?  They land a plane on a bridge. Then admit on the DVD extras that there is no fucking way that could ever happen in real life.   Big Long Punch-Up?  Yes, between Farrell and ex-partner turned French bloke's rescuer. Decent fight, not very well shot though.   Basically, the movie's star power saves it from going down the shitter. Jackson looks cool whatever he does, even in terrible 70's cop flick remakes, and Farrell is one of only three actors today that I'd pay to watch, whatever he did (Ashton Kutcher and Seann William Scott being the other two*). The action sequences are generally well done, though nothing out of the ordinary (and certainly nothing that warrants the $100m budget the movie had -  Three Kings  had better action sequences for less than half that amount). It's just a dumb, fun action movie. Better than  Revolutions , but then what isn't?  *just kidding. I meant Brendan Fraser and Ben Affleck.          ",0

Can't feel too bad about it though.  Anyone watch the Grammys? They're quite crap, but they make the Brits look like a school disco. The best bits were:    Prince!!! And Beyonce in short skirt! Together!   Celine Dion's mic didn't work, and when she got a replacement, she ruined the atmosphere of the song (a tribute to Luther 'stroke' Vandross) by tapping her mic about 5 times to check it was working. Daft bint.  Outkast. Of course.  Black Eyed Peas and JT. Timberlake's own performance was nothing special, because he chose the worst single from his album (Senorita - shite).   Foo Fighters played with some jazz pianist. Sounds crap on paper, but it worked pretty well. Funny just to see Dave Grohl headbanging to a piano solo.  The White Stripes were OK as well I suppose  The other 2 hours and 30 minutes were dull though. Coldplay got 'political', Justin apologised for getting Janet's baps out, and there was a nice long rant about how we're robbing the music industry by downloading music for free.

"1890","2001020","Student","                 Due to the beauty of the fact that I've just finished my second year of law school, I have decided to post YET AGAIN, for the third time today.  I honestly don't think anyone's complaining anyway.  I have been waiting months and months to just sit down and spill my heart, so why don't I just indulge myself, just this once?  So, ahhhh.  Time to reflect on the mess that was my second year.  Well, I started off being everyone's lust object and indulging in those desires, then I realized I more than lusted for someone who definitely was not more than lusting back.  He ended up making some lame excuse and making a quick getaway, only to find out later that he was fucking a friend of mine at the same time!  No sweat off his back!  Then I went to Puerto Rico with the sister, after almost sex-free months...then I came back, spiraled out of control one weekend, and I'll pay for it forever.  But it helped me realize that it's time to grow up, time to stop thinking that some acts are merely games.  I then met someone who'd been right under my nose all along, only to be faced with the fact that oh, graduation is near, and oh, he's moving to Florida!  Oh, and yeah, one of us still has yet to make a move...with less than 10 days to go!  And that's just my love life we're talking about!  If we wanna go deeper, I dealt with a backstabbing friend who has no respect for me whatsoever (and now it's just a matter of time until I completely burst and tell him the fuck off), I made a friend in a girl out of circumstances that I don't completely like (and who I also don't completely trust, as she *is* always running after the boys I seem to like), I cut off a friendship with someone when I couldn't handle the fact that we were not going to be in a pseudo-relationship anymore (here-but-not-here girlfriends...and then some!), I compromised my values but I enjoyed doing it (for the most part), and I realize that some feelings are better ignored instead of trying to fight them anymore.  I realized that maybe there actually might be someone out there for me, but it's not here, and it's probably not R, and it's probably not someone I know right now...but I love to think about the boys I *do* know and wonder...PZ being one.  I moved in with my best friend, but we are remaining here in this apartment as more of acquaintances than anything.  I realized who I could trust and who I really can't (but isn't that an epiphany that occurs yearly?).  I didn't travel nearly enough, but I will have the Next Great Intern Adventure this summer in DC.  I hooked up with someone from high school that was symbolic of the most unfinished business of my past more than anything.  What's with me saying 'than anything' a lot today?  I must still be in a comparative analysis mindset from that damn paper I turned in yesterday.  I bonded with my mom over the most unlikely event, I watched both my mother and sister get engaged, and then my sister get unengaged (is that a word?) and realize that she could do much better than she was letting herself see.  I finally cut off my ties (in general) with a group of girls who were supposed to be my best friends...but really aren't.  I cried too much over nothing (as I always seem to), and I thought too much about everything (another regular me thing).  I've cursed law school up and down and bemoaned my terrible choice of higher education, but I'm going to pull through for the last year, because I have to.  I didn't do as well as I should with keeping in touch with friends, but they know I love them, I know they know.  I was a better 'girl's girl' this year, and I pride myself on that...after all, my real friends are HERE, and nowhere else, save maybe NYC (A, K) and my sister and my mom.  So...that is me, that is life, that is my year in review.  I am terrified of my third year in law school, but you just have to roll with the punches, right?  I'll make it.  I always do.  I've made it this far...I'm not gonna lose it.               ",0

He was a visionary and he died broke and without fanfare.  The guy I really like though was his brother-in-law, Cliff Gardner.  He said to Philo, 'I know everyone thinks you're crazy, but I want to be a part of this.  I don't have your head for science, so I'm not gonna be much help with the design and mechanics of the invention.  But it sounds like in order to do your  testing, you're gonna need glass tubes.' See Philo was inventing a cathode receptor, and even though Cliff didn't know what that meant or how it worked, he'd seen Philo's drawing and he knew they were gonna need glass tubes and since television hadn't been invented yet, it's not like you could get 'em at the local TV repair shop. 'I want to be a part of this', Cliff said, 'and I don't have your head for science.  How would it be if I taught myself to be a glassblower?  And I could set up a little shop in the  backyard.

"1897","1987213","Religion","       A great quote from John Yoder  The believer's cross is no longer any and every kind of suffering, sickness, or tension, the bearing of which is demanded.  The believer's cross must be, like his Lord's, the price of his social nonconformity.  It is not, like sickness or catastrophe, an inexplicable, unpredictable suffering; it is the end of a path freely chosen after counting the cost.  It is not... an inward wrestling of the sensitive soul with self and sin; it is the social reality of representing in an unwilling world the Order to come.   Here is a great paradox taken from Lee Camp's new book, Mere Discipleship.  The cross of Jesus signifies for the disciple both Christ dying in our stead (so that we need not die as slaves to sin, for his atoning sacrifice has undone the power of sin unto death), and Christ calling us to die with him (so that we must be willing to die with him, for rebellious powers have yet to accept his lordship).  That is, the cross proclaims that we need no longer die as a consequence of our sins, and yet we must die, or be willing to do so, because of the world's sins.          ",0

I told her to get off my case because my room was fine and that the smell was coming from me, and then she asked me when the last time I took a shower was and well... you know what I was doing for the next 30 minutes. As it turns out we were both right. The room still smelled.  Last month she approached me about organizers. She said 'If you clean up your room  really  nice, I'll buy you a closet organizer!'. She made it sound all sparkly like candy, but I knew it was a trick. Closet organizers arn't   fun  !

"1919","1957684","Military","          I have come to the conclusion that I am nobody. I am one who fails at every commitment ever made. Most importantly my commitment to Christ. I hardly ever pic up my Bible anymore I feel like such a fraud. The Word of God I know to be his love displayed to a wretched unworthy world. He became manifest in the flesh to redeem me!?  I know that he is omni- everything which means that becuase I have accepted Him He will not just give up on me. For He knew the very moment I would forget him, the very moment I would rebel in my heart and He forgave it....all of it on the cross. I am so sorry Lord! I can say these words with all emotion, with full sincerity, but why will I walk away and forget him in my next breath? This is the dichatomy of man we put God in a nice little box so we can sit at the throne of our own hearts and make Him our conveinant footstool.  I ask how can our Lord be so long suffering? Forgetting that long suffering is one of his eternal attributes that can never be diminished.  I am a carnal, nominal, luke warm Christian... Can such a one even be considered worthy of the crown of life.      I preached a sermon a while back in my home church I called 'free grace, at a price' In it I basically said that if we truly considered what was done on the cross for our sake, made it our daily meditation, and honestly strove to pick up our cross daily and die unto ourselves.   Then there is no way we could continue on in the sin that we do. I was reading Bonhoeffer at the time and hopefully reconciled it with the grace of God properly. 2 John v. 6 says and this is love that we walk in obediance to His commands.... Read Psalms 119:97-128 and you will see the link between love and obediance. John 14:15 Our Lord himself says; If you love me you will obey my commands. Galatians 5:6 says that....For in Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value. The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love. 1 John is chalk full of what our love should look like.  I am talking about gift love here the same love which was displayed when Christ willingly went to the cross for our sins even though we did nothing to deserve it. I know even now all my righteousness is as filthy rags and I am Justiflied by Faith and there is nothing I can do that it is all his work being done in me. I still want to grow and change and put away childish things. 'Work in progress' I commit myself into your able hands mold me and make me Lord.... Lord God Almighty, Savour, Master, Creator of heaven and earth.  Help me to love, calm my anxious thoughts, guide my forward steps in your divine purpose, help to be more you and less me by loving my brother and giving to those in need. I ask all of this in the Name of Jesus Christ, Amen!         ",0

This place is truly a subtropic paradise which I now realize I did not apreciate as I should have. It is kinda silly now that I am in my last few weeks I am trying to suck the marrow out of Okinawa, trying to experience everything I can. Today I just drove all around Island and found Japanese malls that had T-shirts with misspelled words. I think they are hilarious to read.  I wonder if such humor is reciprocal? If they laugh at us when we think we are looking cool in our shirts with Japanese and Chinese writing on them? Anyways, back to the experiencing this place, I think I will wake up tommorrow and take some good pics of the sunrise.  I hope to have a picture page up before to long so that people can see some of the nature pictures I have taken, as well as some of my freinds from home and those I have made while abroad.

"1925","1944324","Student","       You're both right. Michael, yes, you've singled out arrogance and meanness (but in a good natured way) as your niche on the blog.  And, as every good webcomic teaches us, every group of good guys needs an ambiguously evil character.  So, we put up with you and don't take offense.  In fact we enjoy your presence. HOWEVER, the mean guy is not the main character, and many feel you are taking over the blog by posting too much.  And you didn't preface this niche, so Erin, who doesn't know you, obviously thought you were just an asshole (pardon my crude slang).   So, Micheal be your own person, but less often, and Erin, don't ake anything he says seriously.  If he says something that really offends you, don't tell Marten, tell him.  He'll probably apologize.  Otherwise I'll beat him up.  I've probably oversimplified, but that's my two cents. To everyone else who has dissappeared in the midst of all this, come back and do like always.

[Nope you were the only one who doesnâ€™t know me and itâ€™s common knowledge that to know me is to love me. Just ask Sophia. â€“Michael] It might as well be out in the open if he's going to ask you to reveal that informationâ€”not something a nice person would ask you to do, if you ask meâ€” and if he's going to stay and wants to be hostile to somebody.

I donâ€™t actually think that you are bitchy or have a thing for Rob Lowe. I did not mean to offend you. I never knew that you were offended until I got Martenâ€™s message. I pretty much knew it was you, because everyone else knows me, and knows that Iâ€™m obnoxious and sort of an ass sometimes, but other times Iâ€™m as cute as a little bugâ€™s ear.

"1943","1926378","indUnk","           This past Friday, my mom, Tish, and I went to see the traveling Broadway musical, The Lion King.  We actually got to attend a pre-screening of the show courtesy of United Way, so I felt important.  Anyway, I must say that all of the hype was well worth it.  I did enjoy the original cartoon flick, but this blew me away.  The story line is the same, but they have added a couple new songs for the production.  In my opinion (and the Tonys agree as well), the costumes are what make this production so spectacular.  They create a giraffe from a person balancing all fours on stilts and them wearing a long giraffe neck and head.  These creatures come on stage teetering and anbling around, much like a real giraffe.  The opening number (the good old 'Circle of Life') brings all the animals of the sahara out to celebrate Simba's brith, including an elephant, a cheetah, gazelles, soaring birds, and zebra.  Just fantastic.    I must also comment on the music, since it is a musical.  It is rich with African influence and Rafiki, the crazy monkey, takes on the role of almost an ancient African healer.  Not that he wasn't in the movie, but it is exaggerated in the live show.  But the new songs, the scenery, the costumes all keep it real with the African theme.  Loved it!  Just in case I've piqued your interest, the show will remain in Indy until the end of March and then goes to Columbus, San Fran, Boston, and Detroit (not in that order), and is always playing up in NYC.

"1944","1926378","indUnk","       Greetings from sunny So-Cal.  I'm jealous of those on the East coast, whose weekends have begun, as I'm dying to get out of here.  On tap for the weekend:  A bunch of us movie nerds are headed to see Sofia Coppola's latest film,  urlLink 'Lost in Translation ', which opens tonight in select theaters.  Bill Murray with Tokyo as his backdrop, unable to speak the language is sure to be some visually and comically arresting stuff.    I'm getting the hair cut tomorrow at  urlLink The Standard Hotel on Sunset .  There's a hip salon there that's dirt cheap called Rudy's Barbershop, and they have free valet with validation!  The coolest thing is that you can't book appointments in advance there.  So you just go in, put your name on the list, and then go wait in one of the hotel lounge or pool areas where some eurotrash dj is spinning some tunes.  It's a great place to spy on celebs and beautiful people while sitting in a big furry white chair, sipping on a $12 martini.  It's almost worth the price of a plane ticket to take part in this fun little afternoon.   Last time I was there, John, Leah, and I spotted Jessica Simpson (of recent  urlLink MTV 'Newlyweds ' fame) and two of her pals laying out by the pool that overlooks the city.  They were drinking Amstel Lights and getting even orangy-browner by the L.A. minute.  Leah also commented when J.S. was getting up to put her clothes on, that she hadn't ever seen a skirt that short.  Oh, and those boobs have to be fake.  If you haven't caught any of her MTV reality show, you must, as it's horrrrible.  She asks her 98degree husband, Nick Lachey, if Chicken of the Sea is tuna or chicken.  This goes on for five + minutes.  It's so bad it's good!    Have a great weekend everyone.  Happy blogging!         ",0

Ended up watching the Friends Finale thingy after telling myself that I wouldn't earlier because I haven't really watched it in like 2 years (I'm just going through the DVDs instead). But it was as good as every other Friends episode. I guess you either like that show or you don't, though. I didn't like the last scene with the foosball table. Just too horrible to describe here. And for everything that I've been through. The whole Ross and Rachel getting together in the end wouldn't actually happen in real life. What would have happened was Rachel would have told Ross that it was too late and then she would have still left and any sort of contact would slowly dissolve until conversations were whittled down to meaningless grunts about how they're really busy and they don't have much time to really talk, but they're ok, and they hope the other is doing ok.  Filled out a few bills. I like paying the few bills that I can, online. Much faster. I hate writing out my address and shit on envelopes.  Fed Angie again. She was a little grumpy about being shorted on food earlier today. The girl's getting a weight problem...I do what I can, but I'm a softy for an upset girl.  I'm deciding what I want to eat again. Carrots will work I guess. Tomorrow is already fucking friday. I have no idea where the weeks go anymore. Seriously. Weeks go by so damn quickly now. I guess that's a good thing, but I feel that before I know it I'll be 30 and wondering what happened to my last few years in the 20's. I'm semi-seriously thinking about looking at some prices on houses in town here by the river.  Semi-seriously because I don't know if I want to buy a house in this town. But now that it's so nice out again, I love being out by the river (as long as it's  far  away from the paper factory). I'm half debating whether or not to see  urlLink Val Helsing  this weekend. The few reviews I read haven't been all that nice, but it still seems like it would be a great popcorn movie. I was hoping the same when I saw  urlLink Underworld  and that really let me down, though.

I watched this one episode recently where this family had some sort of giant pet turtle â€“ although it didnâ€™t live in the house or anything. I think that the turtle just happened into their yard and because their yard was really big, and because turtles move about a mile a year, they claimed it as their pet. Well I guess one day they realized that their â€œpet turtleâ€ had finally crossed their giant lawn and was now gone. And then, for whatever reason, there was a lot of snow. And then the dad got brain cancerâ€¦BRAIN CANCERâ€¦and was having trouble getting better. And then the turtle came back and suddenly the guy was healthy again.

Last night I was so tired, I did some sketching in a sketch book    and had my lights out by 11:30.    &nbsp;   Sometimes I get so angry with my drawing hand, because I can't draw as good as I used to.&nbsp; My hand bothered me for 5 years before I saw a doctor and the only reason I did was because it had swollen almost twice its size. I couldn't bend my fingers. After seeing 3 different doctors, it was confirmed I had Carpal Tunnel Syndrome...and if operated on the prognosis wasn't all that great.. a 40-60% ration. Now if the ratio was reversed, I might would go for the surgery but.. I don't want to take a chance and lose the remaining use of my hand.    &nbsp;   So what do I do... I draw a little at a time when I can. I take Advil or Alieve in the am with breakfast. Do some exercises that help relieve the pressure on the carpal tunnel nerve and thank God daily for what I can do with my hand.   &nbsp;   So far, its not gotten worse --tho in the summer and winter it bothers me muchly. Today its stiff but typing is helping to loosen up the fingers.   &nbsp;   Man, didn't mean to run off about CTS.   &nbsp;   Saw&nbsp; the Village on Thursday. A good flick. Not as good as Signs but still good. Neat twist to the film. I bet the critics are having a hard time with this one, because if they write too much about the plot it gives the story away and would ruin it. I went in blindly, only vaguely remembering what I saw of the previews during the promotional stage of the film. I'm glad I didn't know much. I couldn't figure it out... and when the twist was revealed I wondered... was I hearing it wrong???? When I realized what was happening I was like...

Abu Ghraib holds 1,500 prisoners, a fraction of whom were abused. Saddam's graves held as many as 300,000 people, all of whom were murdered. How is Abu Ghraib 10 times more important than that?

"1965","1889734","Student","       Mark tossed in some comments on the Rush addiction issue.  E-Mail starts:  To back up Don... Todd, to say you lost respect for Rush because he could not recognize his addiction, put it in perspective of his current life and success, and simply pick up the phone and dial up help is naive.  Hitting 'rock bottom' is a clinical term for a reason.  I can see what you are thinking, if you had his life, you wouldn't let anything screw it up, but you are making two incorrect assumptions.  1.) You are projecting your perspective into your imagination of his life.  For Rush, the risk of an addiction is as great as your current risk of addiction. He loses his job, destroys his family and hits 'rock bottom', albeit in the public eye (something he is used to anyway so that can be argued as no additional risk).  It doesn't matter that he is a talk show host and you are a QA engineer, the relative risks are the same/  2.) An addict, by the nature of addiction, cannot recognize the addiction while involved with it.  99% of the time, no matter what the addiction or who is addicted, it takes some large scale event or tradegy (rock bottom) to even be able to realize that there is a problem.  Making a move to get help is entirely another step that can be just as difficult as recognizing the problem.  The only time I have heard of someone taking a pre-emptive addiction counselling step is Ben Affleck for alcohol, which is hoopla cause he still 'socially' drinks, can you smell publicity?  I know I am running dangerously close to liberal grounds by taking responsibility away from the individual in correcting their own problems, but I am just being realistic about the nature and proven physiology of an addiction.  It's easy for non-addicts to say you should have gotten help, but that is just ignorance towards the nature of the human mind and addiction.  On the other hand, when you recognize the problem, seek help and receive treatment, then, in my mind, you have the responsibility of staying clean and sober and falling back off the wagon is in-excusable, that's the point that I combine the liberal and conservative views in my thinking.  Sorry to sound like I am jumping on you, I just have seen this kind of stuff up front (not just from our family) and it has modified my thoughts on addiction.   End E-mail.  No, you aren't jumping on me.  This is a good discussion.    I should also note that my loss of respect is hypothetical at this point.  Much will depend on the truth when we know it.  I guess I simply lack an understanding of addiction.  I assume rationality, but addiction is by nature irrational.  Perhaps that is the root of my problem here.  I can't understand destroying yourself, especially when there is much to loose.    So perhaps my assessment is unfair.  I am willing to re-examine my thoughts about Rush's possible problem.  My lack of experience with it makes for difficult understanding.  However, in Rush's position, I think he bears a greater responsibility due to his position and stated opinions on his show.  It seems consistent to expect a man who spends much of his time promoting responsibility and leadership to recognize a problem within himself.  If he was a mere NFL commentator, then I could see the addiction getting out of hand since it isn't on the radar everyday.    Like Matthew Perry from Friends.  If the Chandler character is on every show going on about AA and drug recovery, yet the actor is drinking himself blind or popping pain meds (which happened), I would expect some sort of light to go on in his head.  Those circumstances seem contrary.  But since Chandler is just a funny man, the addiction is simply a bad thing that happened to an actor, and I'll keep watching the show and laughing at him.    With Rush, I can't help but feel that this shouldn't have happened.  Or at least he should have got some help (again, that's probably my problem right there...expecting him to recognize the problem).  Bah, I'm getting tangled up here trying to express my concern.  Leave it at this - I simply feel betrayed.  I want it to be false, and if it is true, I want him to get better.  But ultimately, his credibility will always be damaged on issues of responsibility and conduct.    Am I too harsh?  Perhaps.  The only addict I knew is dead by his own hand.  I lack a lot of experience with the problem, and most of what I do know is in retrospect, after he was gone.  I am angry about that.  Not that it matters, but he dissapointed me as I discovered more of what was going on.    But I have not been addicted or witnessed it first hand, so perhaps my anger is misplaced.  I can concede that.    My personal nature can best be described as compulsive.  When I find something I enjoy, I tend to go full-bore and squeeze the life out of it, driving all those around me crazy with my obsession.  Perhaps that is a similar thing to addiction.  I don't know.  But I can't imagine taking something I am obsessed about and destroying my life and family in order to persue it.  There are limits.  I'm just trying to describe my blind spot here.  I'm not denying that addiction is a powerful force.  But Rush is like Caesar, he must be beyond reproach because of the role he has assumed.    Okay, chime in.  I don't mind kicking this around.  And don't worry about blasting me.           ",0
"1966","1883213","Manufacturing","       MUTINY  One of the things one just assumes when one is directing a movie, as far as I know, is that everyone around you on the set thinks your a complete idiot. Sure, if you're speilberg or Scorsese they all think you are a genius, but I'm not quite either of those guys yet(and I stress the yet) So on MY movie set I am considered to be an idiot by the people I work with.  Idiot is a harsh word. I'll try to illustrate the principle in more detail through examples. On this level everyone thinks they could be doing the directors job better than he is, and more than that not everybody involved really knows what the directors job is. My job as the director of this film is to make sure it turns out goood. If it doesn't turn out good, it's my fault. The director is responsible, in my eyes for seeing that the movie is the sum of it's part, and to make sure the parts are good, AND if he really wants to do something good then he also has to make sure it's more than the sum of it's part. That part is a sorta magic trick.   But it's everything from making sure that things cut together right to making sure you have enough c-stands to making sure that the key grip gets lunch even if he doesn't tell you he's hungry. Making sure everyone is happy is key- it's more than key- it's critical, it's huge, it's very fucking important. And, as I alreadty explaining, everybody is pretty much sure I'm crazy, mad, selfish, slef invovled, obsessed, and destructive.   My personal life has blended with the film ina  manner that is both highly unprofefssional and given the specific circumstances, morally questionable. This hasn't helped me. I really shot myself in the foot, and while at tiomes I still limp a bit, for the most part I've tried to run through the pain and pretend there is no bullet lodged in my foot, or just pretend that it's helping me be more motivated to run harder.   The other night things started to turn inwards on me. My lead, who has often seemed half in and half out of the project, told me he was very upset with me for asking him not to get involved with the female lead, and then going ahead and getting involved with her myself. This guy is also my roomate/best friend. Bad twaysh as they say. More than that, my brother worries fro my sanity and thinks the brain pills I'm taking might be the cause of my 'mania'. Everyone is angry that I made them stand on top of a mountain that was crumbling beneath their feet while I got the shots I needed. The DP has bruises all over his body from holding our arribl on his shoulder all weekend, and the oproducer I think, feels that I have stepped on his toes a bit.   Somehow I quelled the resistance by trying to ask everyone to ddetach my personal life from the movie, by trying to explain to them where I was coming from, and asking them to please stay on board, not just for me and 'my movie'(which it isn't- it's all of our movies, the sound guy, the make-up girl, the leads, the extras, the bit players, the AD's, etc. etc.) we don't get money for this. our reward is doing good work. Having a good time and having something of quality to show for it. Thats all I can offer these people for their hearts and souls. Their bodies and minds. And so whenever I stand in the shower, hot water blasting the sweat off my body, and I think of which close-ups I didn't get, I just pound the wall: how could I fuck that up. How could I forget something. How come I made that mistake. Why didn't I stansd firmer ion getting that shot.  When I look at a piece of make-up and think it looks wrong or amateurish something inside me breaks. When I look at a set and think 'This ain't a jungle. It's a fucking backyard' something inside me screams. we don't have the advantage of knowing our movie will be weaqtchable because we have the things at our desposal to make it that way. We have to first make sure we can get the bear minimun of watchable covered, and on top of that we have to make it good- not good greatp- fucking amazing. And we will. And for some reason they all still sorta kinda believe in me. I have to show them proof. Maybe some dailies cut together....   more later....         ",0

"1968","1865731","indUnk","           After a long, long day of work, and despite the tempation to skip it, I made my first step into the gym!  I barely made it before it closed, giving me about 30 minutes to do exactly what I had gone to do:  walk fastly for 30 minutes on a treadmill.  To help me with my newfound enthusiasm for fitness, I bought some simple, but cozy and cool sweats and a couple of cheap t-shirts and a good ole hat to throw on before and after.  I walked at 3.5 mph at a 6.0 grade for 30 minutes and then a cool down.  My damn legs were burning and I felt like I was walking on rubber when I stepped off of the treadmill.  I wondered if I would feel self-conscious in the gym and for the most part, I didn't feel anything except my focus.  My music helped, though I swear, just one teensy step with the wrong angle or timing and I would have flown off the belt.  I had to really focus and just keep walking, walking, walking...  Luckily, there were very few people there that late at night.  And even luckier that no one saw the large, long strip of tape running up the side of my new sweats reading  [size:  L L L L L L L L L L] .

Here is a copy of the letter.&nbsp; Please pass it on:       A PETA investigation has revealed the grotesque abuse of animals in laboratories at Columbia University, including baboons who are subjected to invasive surgeries and left to suffer and die in their cages without painkillers. This horrific story came to our attention because a courageous whistleblower who was a veterinarian in Columbia's laboratories stepped forward to tell us what she had witnessed. Thank goodness for good people!  Now, PETA is calling on Columbia to end three crude and cruel experiments, one of which involves artificially inducing strokes in baboons by cutting out their left eyeballs so that a critical blood vessel to their brains can be clamped. These experiments have no practical value. Animal records reveal that baboons have been left without veterinary care while they hunched over in their cages, unable to drink, chew, or even lift their heads. This is the sort of thing that you expect from a horror movie, not a prestigious university!  This abuse must stop! Please e-mail the president of Columbia University, Lee Bollinger, at bollinger@columbia.edu, asking him to put and end to all three experiments now.  To earn 500 Street Team points, BCC your e-mail message to StreetTeam@peta.org before noon on Tuesday, July 27. Be sure to use BCC so that Lee Bollinger can't see that you're also sending a copy to us. If you don't know how to do that, just send us a second copy of your message.

"1975","1862467","indUnk","       A houseguest/fellow blogger mentioned recently in passing the way my blog will fall silent for a few days, and then burst with a flurry of articles or posts within an hour. Here's why: I blog while momming. When I can dedicate myself to writing, I hardly want to spend it blogging pop culture and journal entries. Sorry, I love you guys, but I'm a writer first and a blogger second. When I can't dedicate myself to writing, it's invariably because I'm busy taking care of the children. At these times I often multitask reading online newspapers and other blogs while playing cooking or building blocks. When I come across something particularly interesting, I set that browser window aside and move on. Then, if I get a minute long enough to blog (often these come only once every few days), I go back over the set aside articles and blogs and, typically with the blog this button on the google toolbar, put them on the blog. Hence, the blogging flurries.  Since John began  urlLink the spaceboy  back in January, it's been notoriously neglected. Not by any means has John quit reading all his space- and planetary-oriented articles, and I usually find them burried in browser windows when I sit down to read my stuff. I've taken to occasionally posting them to the spaceboy before killing the window. Hence, the spaceboy's getting article posts again. You can tell if I've posted or if John has (as if he would!) by the ID at the bottom of the post.    Finally, this blog has obviously been suffering from a lack of attention. I can tell by my page hits, which have plummeted, and the comments, which are few and far between. I have only myself to blame as I've been spending much more attention on  urlLink the SprogBlog  lately than the Same River Twice. What can I say? Life has been very kid-centered lately. The SprogBlog rewards me with hits and comments, and I don't feel like I'm competing in a pool of the blogosphere already saturated with pop culture musings. There are very few young moms blogging. Consequently, this blog has seen a lot of article postings, but little commentary and the SprogBlog gets plenty of both.

My Aunt sings in the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus and was able to snag me a ticket.  I am so excited - I can't wait!  I had heard of the opera before but did not know exactly what it was about.  So I googled it.  Carmen was created by  urlLink Georges Bizet (1838-1875)  and founded on the  urlLink novel  by Prosper MÃ©rimÃ©e.  The story begins in 19th Century Spain...   ACT I Soldiers and townspeople mill around in a square in Seville. A young peasant girl, MicaÃ«la, asks the soldiers if they have seen her sweetheart, Don JosÃ©. Telling her heâ€™ll be back soon, they try to persuade her to stay with them, but she declines. The relief soldiers, including Don JosÃ©, arrive. Factory bells ring, and a group of cigarette girls emerges from the factory where they work, including the popular gypsy beauty, Carmen. She focuses her attention on Don JosÃ©, who pretends not to notice. Before leaving, she seductively tosses a flower at him. Alone, Don JosÃ© recovers the flower and reflects on Carmenâ€™s charms. MicaÃ«la finds him and delivers both a letter and a chaste kiss from his mother, who asks her son to marry MicaÃ«la. Don JosÃ© promises his love and fidelity to MicaÃ«la, despite the temptations of Carmen. A ruckus erupts from the cigarette factory. Carmen has injured another woman, and the officer Zuniga commands Don JosÃ© to jail Carmen. But Don JosÃ© succumbs to her charms. He agrees to a rendezvous and lets Carmen escape.  ACT II  At Lillas Pastiaâ€™s inn, Carmen and her friends Frasquita and Mercedes consort with Zuniga and other soldiers. A group of revelers arrives, celebrating Escamillo, the illustrious bullfighter. The crowd cheers as Escamillo boasts of his victories. He notices Carmen, but she remains indifferent. Zuniga, also smitten, tells Carmen that he plans to return to the inn later to visit her. When the crowd disperses, the smugglers Remendado and DancaÃ¯ro try to enlist the aid of Carmen, Frasquita, and Mercedes. Mercedes and Frasquita agree to help them smuggle contraband, but Carmen, expecting Don JosÃ©, wants to stay at the inn. Don JosÃ© arrives, and Carmen dances for him. But distant bugles signal him to return to his quarters and he prepares to leave. Carmen mocks his obedience and encourages him to run away with her and lead the free gypsy life. Don JosÃ© remains unconvinced until Zuniga returns to the inn seeking Carmen. In a jealous rage, Don JosÃ© defies his officerâ€™s orders to leave. As the smugglers pounce on Zuniga and escort him out of the inn, Don JosÃ© has no choice but to remain with the gypsies.  ACT III  At the mountain hideout of the smugglers, Don JosÃ© longs for his mother, who still believes him an honest man. Carmen taunts him and urges him to leave, but he refuses. Frasquita and Mercedes tell their fortunes with a deck of cards. When Carmen takes her turn, the cards foretell death for her and Don JosÃ©. The gypsies set off to smuggle contraband, leaving Don JosÃ© behind to guard the camp. Micaela arrives at the mountain hideout searching for Don JosÃ© and hides among the rocks. Escamillo approaches the camp looking for Carmen. He and Don JosÃ© exchange words and begin to fight. But the smugglers return in time to stop Don JosÃ© from wounding Escamillo, who invites them all to the bullfight in Seville. Her hiding place discovered, MicaÃ«la begs Don JosÃ© to return home to his mother, who is dying. Despite his violent jealousy, Don JosÃ© leaves with MicaÃ«la.  ACT IV At the bullfight, a crowd gathers to watch the procession of toreadors. Escamillo and Carmen arrive together. Mercedes and Frasquita warn Carmen that Don JosÃ© is lurking about. Carmen, unafraid, waits alone for Don JosÃ©. He approaches and begs her to leave with him. She insists that their affair is over, that she does not love him anymore, and that she now loves Escamillo. As Don JosÃ©â€™s demands become more desperate, Carmen throws at him the ring he once gave her, with fatal results.  via  urlLink NYC Opera         urlLink >>more               ",0

"1991","1826722","Military","           I continually hear about how the military is universally Republican, that we all support a candidate like Bush, since he is so 'pro military', and how the only ones of us who are on the left are the 'gay lovers'.  Well, don't believe it.  Sure, I like pay hikes and tax cuts as much as the next guy.  Better benefits help, too.  But there are several more factors in political leaning than those, and even those issues aren't black and white.  Remember the Clinton years?  You know, the ones that were so bad for the military?  The '90's saw the largest year after year hikes in military pay in decades, and I'll tell you from personal experience that a military family at E5 with a child can live quite well.  In Hawaii, no less.  How do I know?  I've done it.  We weren't rich, but we were far from living on food stamps.  I'm a nuke, so I do make more than the mainstream enlisted sailor, but that extra wasn't necessary for living...it went, more often than not, to luxury (big screen TV, scuba classes/equipment, new car, computers).  Those raises came in the Clinton administration, by the way.  Same one that balanced the budget.  No, they didn't do much tax cutting, but when you really look at it the current administration didn't cut taxes significantly (unless you make more than $200,000.)  Oh, the gay issue...I've personally served with people I knew were gay.  They were no different from any other sailor (in fact, most were stellar performers, but to be fair I did know one who was a mediocre performer...a cross-section representative of the Navy as a whole).  They caused no problems by their sexual orientation...it was never an issue (and it wasn't a big secret).  So those critical of the Democrats and Clinton for supporting gays are just being silly...they are no different than the rest of us.  I say worry about something important, like the woefully unbalanced budget.  Shall we discuss personal freedom and liberty?  Clinton had a record of furthering civil rights...the Bush administration's record speaks for itself.  To be fair, Bush had 9/11 to cope with...some tightening of freedoms was inevitable.  But things like the Patriot Act go way too far (even supporters of the original act now call for revision and trimming back.)  I'm going to see 'Fahrenheit 9/11' this weekend, but I'm pretty sure I know how I feel already...from what I hear, I agree with the assessment.  The recent Senate report on the intelligence failures bear out what a lot of people are beginning to realize; Bush looked for any excuse, however thin, to go to war in Iraq, and the WMD issue gave him the excuse he needed.  In short he took us to war in Iraq for reasons (WMD's, Iraqi ties to al Qaida) that were nonexistent.  Bush has been bad for the military (just ask reservists and retirees about their benefits, and everyone about more deployments and combat for a worthless cause), bad for the economy (lost jobs, soaring deficits), bad for the people (lost freedoms and liberties, the erosion of hard won rights and the blocking of rights that harm no one for the sake of 'morality'), and bad for the country (our reputation and presence in the world is at it's worst since Vietnam...likely worse than even that sad era).  Yet many in the military blindly follow along.  They ride behind the half-cocked cowboy because he fulfills a macho, arrogant role for them.  He's the ass-kicking gunslinger who becomes popular through simplistic, black-and-white philosophy that appeals mainly to extremists (like the religious right) and those who don't take the time to scratch the surface and see what is really going on.  Bush has set the attitude of this nation back by decades; those who favor discrimination are more willing to speak out now (witness the flood of negative sentiment against Muslims, disregarding that religious belief does not equal terrorism), the government is pushing a religious right morality more fervently than it has since the 1950's (gay marriage bans, in the form of an amendment), and Americans have in many quarters gone beyond the admirable traits of patriotism and pride in their nation to feeling we are superior to the rest of the world (the reaction to France and the UN speak volumes.)  There are many more indicators of the character of our President, but I think a recent example sums it up pretty well; the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has invited the President to speak at their annual convention each year of his term in office.  He in fact addressed the NAACP at their convention when he was a candidate in 2000.  Since taking office, however, he has been too busy to appear.  This year he had a 'schedule conflict'; in an election year his own code of values makes him the first President since the 1930's to snub the NAACP, and this likely cost him the vote of the black community.  Being invited to speak at their convention is a great honor, and in my mind there is only one reason he would refuse that honor; he considers himself too good to address an organization of a minority.  Says all that needs to be said, I think.  This all being said, this military member won't be supporting Bush.  And I'm not alone; I've spoke to many that no longer back him.  Many cite the same reasons above, mainly our loss of prestige in the world and the economy, as reasons why they no longer support him.  The military is not the conservative bastion it once was...younger, better informed people are in uniform, ones who question, who value what liberties we get to enjoy (many are circumscribed in the service), and who look to our lives outside the service, when we wish to fully enjoy the freedoms we are sworn to defend.  And many see those freedoms, that American dream, that ideal eroding under the current administration.  I sincerely hope more of my fellow service personnel look beyond the standard 'military=Republican' myth and really vote for what is valuable; freedom, our place in a global community, the economy we are leaving to our kids, and the environment we are wrecking.  The wars we are getting in to for lies and the personal goals of one man.  The direction our nation is, sadly, going in, and what we need to do to put it back on the right track.         ",0

"1993","1826527","Science","                 My, it's been a while since blogging, partly due to vacation which occurred last week.  There's plenty of stories to tell, so I will do this as a recap-by-day blog.  For example, I will blog our first day today, our second day tomorrow, and so on.  Here goes.  Enjoy...  07.20.2003  Sunday  Wake up at 5:30 am.  Our flight departs at 9:30 for Myrtle Beach, and I'm told to get to the airport at least 2 hours before departure.  I get ready, finish packing, and my ride gets here at 6:45 am.  We get to  urlLink Newark Liberty International Airport  at approximately 7:05 am, after passing briefly through the lovely town of Irvington.  For those of you unfamiliar with the area, Irvington is like New Jersey's Compton.  We jump in line outside by the skycaps for urlLink Continental Airlines .  The line moved rather quickly actually.  The dude checked our bag and gave us our boarding passes and inside we went.        There's a side note to this story.  I had made our flight reservation in February.  Since that time, I had received 3 different notices in the mail stating that our flight time had changed, with the latest notice changing my seats as well.  I called their 'customer care' number and they said I would have to tell them at the ticket counter inside the airport.   So we make our way to our terminal and make it through security.  I had to take my shoes off, but no big deal otherwise.  We get through and make it to our gate rather early, and notice our flight is not on the computer screen yet.  We head over to the book shop to peruse their selection of reading and get back to find a place to sit for a few hours.  When we came back, I was able to change our seats so we were together.  Well, the flight finally shows up and we board pretty much on time.  We find our seats and the plane begins moving towards the runway, and suddenly the lights and engines stop.  Hmm.  'This is your captain.  We are having some problems with our generator.  Sit tight briefly while maintenance takes a look at it.  Meanwhile, the air is not working, and we are sitting in the plane oh, for about 2 hours before we find out that we have to switch flights.    The flight we are switching to is across the airport, at gate 124 or something.  So we rush across, and have no idea when the flight is leaving, so we eat some Teriyaki chicken at the food court, which was excellent.  The flight begins boarding around 12, and we finally take off soon after.  The flight was pretty smooth, and we landed after 2 sometime.  Now it's time to get the luggage and get my rental car.  I head over to the  urlLink Enterprise  kiosk, and they tell me they don't have any cars left for my reservation, so the guy at least hooks me up with Thrifty for the same price, and probably a better car.    We get to our hotel, the lovely  urlLink Patricia Grand .  We check in at 3, and find our room.  We go in the room.  We realize this vacation is going to suck-diddly-uck.  There's a huge puddle on the rug by the ac and balcony, probably from the ac leaking.  It's not just a little damp, but it's like when it downpours and you go play mini-golf afterwards.  It sloshes like that.  I call the desk and they say they'll send a guy up.  Meanwhile, we examine the room to find mold on the walls, probably from the lake in our room, a smaller room than advertised, and an ash tray, even though I reserved a non-smoking room.  Knock.  Hey guy, come look at this oasis in our room.  Dag, yall, that's about 5 gallons of water, probably cuz the ac froze up.  I'll be back with a vac.  This is all said in the South Carolina accent.  He comes back up very quickly and sucks up the water with a monster shop vac.  He was a real nice guy at least, and quick.    We decide to go out because we're getting hungry and don't want to stay in a moldy room.  We head for  urlLink Broadway at the Beach , which is a big cluster of restaurants, shops, bars, etc., all around this lake thing.  We stroll around to see a long line at the Hard Rock Cafe, which is fine with me, because I didn't want to spend $10 for a burger anyway.  We find a keen place called the Key West Grill.  There's a line, but we decide to see what the wait will be.  The dude says, well there's no wait if you want to eat outside.  Of course!  We're hungry.  We sit right on the dock of this lake, eat some dirty salmon and potato skins, and enjoy a nice breeze.  All right, maybe things won't be so bad after all.  We walk around a bit and decided to hit the  urlLink Imax theater .  We saw some adrenaline video with dudes who jump off planes and fly.  We head back to the hotel and decide to take a night swim in the pool, which was freezing it seemed, but there was no way I was going in the heated indoor pool.  That's where pee lives.  An interesting day one with a not-bad ending after a rather horrible beginning.  We'll see what Monday brings.             ",0
"1994","1826527","Science","                 Friday is pizza night.  It's been that way forever pretty much.  I just found out that the new  urlLink No Motiv  cd has been pushed back to 2004.  Why?  So Vagrant can promote dashboard and autumn to asses even more.  Garbage.  Last night, I applied for a job to  urlLink this place .  I saw a posting in my local paper for a 4th grade maternity leave.  It would start in mid-November and go till the end of the year.  I really don't want to be a sub again, but if it's all I can find, what can I do right?    On a sad note, I found that the man who did the voice of Monterey Jack in Chip N Dale's Rescue Rangers passed away on August 11th.  I was saddened by this, because he was indeed my favorite character, and it came as quite a shock.  So I wish his family well.             ",0

"1996","1826527","Science","                 I'm bored.  Just waiting to go to my orientation at Montclair.  I've finally received some recognition of my lack of acceptance letter.  I got an email from someone who says I'll receive a letter this week.  He also acknowledged the fact that a letter was sent on Dec 17th and doesn't know why I never got it.  Anyway, I hope it doesn't drag on too long.  It's supposed to run from 1-3:30, but I think time was included to buy textbooks, which I'm not doing because I'm pretty sure everyone else will be and I don't want to wait.  Right now, the weather bug says its 7 out.  Should be a fun walk to the student center.  Anyway, I also checked my account status online, since I haven't gotten a bill yet or loan info yet, but under the list of charges it has some loans listed, so I'm hoping that's real, and my semester(and full year) is paid for!  Now, Disney World may just be possible.  Shweet...Strange dates, but is anyone gonna be home Feb 20th?  Brian Regan is appearing around here and Kim and I are probably going...             ",0
"1997","1822234","indUnk","       back to the grind of the day to day work.  The big ol' project is over and I can finally sit at my desk without grinding my teeth every time I hear the phone ring or the bing of an email alert.  I actually opened my sunroof on the drive in today and enjoyed the smell as I drove past the bread factory.  Last week was all about four days in San Diego, one starting at 3am.  We only saw the sun on the last day.  Which we didn't much care about anyways because we were all working on about 4 hours of sleep.       for the entire weekend.  Since the past two weeks were so consumed by work I can honestly say I didn't enjoy my birthday as much as I wanted to, but Alex had a small dinner party for me the Friday before my birthday and I had dinner at my  urlLink favorite restaurant  with other friends on my actual birthday.  Even though thoughts of the work project kept gnawing in the back of my head I had a nice time at both events, I got to spend time with almost all my friends and eat some pretty great food.  It was, however, a little frightening when I realized that the older I get the role of food on my birthday becomes more and more prominent and inevitable.  Come to think of it, my coworkers took me out to lunch for my b-day as well, and while there we having lunch we discussed what food I would be partaking of that evening.  I am having trouble buttoning some of my pants this week.    I also had a life changing experience; I received  urlLink TiVo  as a gift.  TV will never be the same for me.  Alex knew exactly what I wanted (because I told him everyday for about a month) and now he is officially an enabler to my addiction.  I could go on and on about my new pal TiVo and all the fun we're having, but I think I can sum it up like this: pair my brazen love for TV with my enthusiasm for efficiency.  Words cannot describe the bliss.  Coaxed by TiVo and it's ability to CHOOSE SHOWS FOR ME I may confront some bad decisions as far as reality TV is concerned, but I somehow feel justified in my zeal because I can skip over commercials.    please don't judge us.  TiVo and I think we can make this thing last.          ",0
"1998","1822234","indUnk","       In May 2000 Alex and were married in Las Vegas, which is what made it an appealing stop off on our road trip.  However, every time I go there I forget how sick I get of that place after about 3 hours.  The Strip is a lot longer than I think it is, every time, and I always wear the wrong shoes.  And the people, so many people.  People who need to stop and look at something, people who can't chew gum and walk at the same time.  I know that's what Vegas is all about, but for some reason I like to picture it differently in my imagination and then feel a sad, sad let down when it's the way it always was.  We stayed at the  urlLink Tropicana  by default.  There was some sort of convention in town and all the nice hotels were all booked up.  We were supposed to be staying in the Garden Room section of the 'original' (a.k.a. two floors that look out onto the parking lot) hotel, but the woman at the front desk did a good job of convincing me that the for 10 bucks more we would be better off in one of the towers.  16th floor, here we come.  The room was absolutely hideous.  The bed had a headboard of mirrors that continued up and onto the ceiling.  There was also a wall of mirror on the right side of the bed.  and a giant mirror on the dresser directly across from the bed.  Let us not forget that I was faced with all these reflections of me after the bathing suit debacle.  how unfortunate.  After resting up in the magical mirror room for a bit we walked down the strip to the  urlLink Aladdin .  Alex heard that the dinner buffet was pretty good there and the hotel wasn't complete the last time we were there, so we thought we should check it out.  We strolled down the Strip, smashing into other tourists and refusing cards with numbers of call girls.  By the time we got to the Aladdin I had a big ol' blister on my right foot, all because I wanted to wear cute shoes.  When will I learn; you can't wear cute shoes in Vegas unless you're planning to park yourself at a slot machine all night.  We did have to wait in line for the buffet, about a half hour, not too bad.  The other people in line were entertaining though.  The man behind us in line was with his family of 5 and never uttered a word.  He did, however, amuse himself by feeling up the 4 inch 'jewels' which were embedded in the walls of the casino.  I couldn't help but notice how he was fondling them and it was actually kind of creepy.  He did it for awhile, until he noticed that I noticed him doing it.  He then immediately stopped and started tapping and knocking on each jewel as if to indicate how sturdy each one was.  He nodded in my direction and I smiled, in approval of the sturdy jewels.  Alex asked me what was so funny and I said 'keep your eyes on the jewels' and then he laughed, so I assumed he noticed, too.  We finally made our way through the line, down an escalator and into another line where we could finally see food and a hostess.  Jewel groper continued to tap, not fondle, all surfaces as he passed them.  Alex and I were pretty quiet during our wait, but we were both chuckling.  As we finally sat down to eat Alex asked me if I was laughing about the man in front of us, so I explain the groper guy, who Alex didn't notice at all, and then I asked what he had been laughing about.  As it turns out when I said keep your eyes on the jewels Alex looked at the dude in front of us who apparently was playing with his crotch the entire time we were in line, while his whole family watched.  I guess jewels would be correct term for that as well.    The buffet was pretty good, the best part was the dessert, but isn't that always the best part?  After dinner we walked down to  urlLink Treasure Island .  Four years ago our extremely klassie wedding package included a video of our wedding, complete with a clip at end of pirates (from the free pirate show in front of the hotel) cheering our union.  We thought it would be fun to watch the pirate show again.  Luckily, a show was starting as we got there.  Sadly, the show has changed.  Treasure Island has changed.  If you go the website you will notice how desperate they are to change their image.  The show was so bad that we actually left half way through.  What used to be a wholesome show with the British navy and a rowdy group of pirates is now a show with a gaggle of Sirens (who clearly worship Christina Aguilera) going up against a bevy of shirtless, oiled pirates who sail in on ship boldly called The Bull.  The Sirens tempt the pirates and the pirates fight back, blah, blah, blah.  The show is complete with horrible songs that sound like sorry rip-offs of Britney Spears' masterpieces and plenty of jokes about blow the man down, it's so wet, your ship is  going down , etc.  Although it was funny to watch, it was crowded and Alex and I were a little disappointed to see our beloved pirates tossed aside for these slutty Sirens, so we walked away.  I'm assuming at the end of the show there's a big dance party and everyone hooks up.   This  urlLink Japanese site  has some pictures (click on the colored text to see more pics) to give you a better idea of the trashiness I can't quite put to words.  I miss the Bucaneer Bay show.  I guess I'm getting old.  sigh.  It was a long walk back to the Tropicana, especially with cute shoe blisters, so we stopped off at the  urlLink Bellagio  to check out the water show and to play nickel slots and video poker for awhile.  We lost 30 bucks and then headed back to our hotel.  I think it might be a long, long time before we visit Vegas again.         ",0
"1999","1818292","indUnk","        A WEEKEND WITH THE MORELOSâ€™   Iâ€™ve known the Morelosâ€™ for 14 years because theyâ€™re Iyaâ€™s family and I love them like my own! Lemme break â€˜em down for you all, just for fun. Head of the family, Tito Nesty, soft-spoken and calm (like many of our dads are), always has a smile on his face and an occasional cap on his head. Heâ€™s Mr. Tennis Pro who loves and real often sounds like Frank Sinatra (wow, sipsip!). Tita Susie, Iyaâ€™s mommy, has always reminded me of Cindy Walsh, Brenda and Brandonâ€™s mom on 90210. Itâ€™s cuz sheâ€™s such a caring, well-spoken woman, a problem solver, who always has a solution to lifeâ€™s problems, big and small. Sheâ€™s also quite the brain, which validates Iyaâ€™s â€œintelligenceâ€ I guessâ€¦hee hee heeâ€¦just playing Iya! You know Iâ€™m justh jealousth of you! Iyaâ€™s got two older brothers; Kuya Dennis, who has inherited Tito Nestyâ€™s taciturn disposition, is married to Ate Myla, a nurse. They're expecting their first baby this summer; Kuya Francis, funny man who proudly works for DREAMWORKS, is married to Ate Jenny (a future singer I tell you!). Theyâ€™re expecting their first baby this May (or maybe April, according to their doctor) and my sister and I had the pleasure of assisting Iya with their baby shower this past Saturday. You already know Iya so I won't talk about her (Refer back to her  Getting to know   profile on January 26th for further info).  So the baby shower, themed with moon and stars, was inspired by the DREAMWORKS symbol. It was so funny because so many of Kuya Francis and Ate Jenny's friends are having babies too. There were AT LEAST 3 or 4 pregnant women there this weekend, I kid you not! I think thatâ€™s so wonderful! All their kids have future playmates already! I canâ€™t wait until all of you who are reading this start having kids! Can you imagine? 10 years from now, most of us will be parents! Scary thought considering the boys are still way into their lemme-try-to-grab-your-crotch-as-my-way-of-saying-hello stages. Anyhow, everyone had fun at the shower with the fun games and great food provided. GREAT JOB NINANG IYA!  On Sunday, I attended a memorial service and mass for Iyaâ€™s ninang, Tita Annie, who passed away last week. Bittersweet was the day, as most memorial services tend to be. Sad as everyone was for her passing, it was also a day that celebrated her life. Iyaâ€™s relatives from the east coast even flew out here to add to the loving farewells to a family member who I know they will miss dearly.   Seeing how a family reacts to two such juxtaposing events such as those that surpassed this weekend is a true telling of their character. Joyous was Saturday afternoon, overflowing with excitement and anxiety for the new parents-to-be, not to mention the freshest little light of life to come. Sunday was somber, filled with a regretful sadness that only death can bring, but capped with a unique comfort that only family can provide. These are the Morelosâ€™, and spending time with them this weekend only reminds me of how lucky I am as well, to be part of a family as fun-loving, quirky and caring as they are. Ever present are the trials that life can bring, but so too are the ties that bind, that which we call family.          ",0

I'll probably call you later b/c I won't be able to wait for you to reply. On my way out of a restaurant tonight I saw that  there is somewhere new opening and they have 'the dancing girls' going on.  What is the deal with these chicks?  Every time somewhere opens they have balloons a little stage and two girls doing synchronized dancing out front.  I guess this is why I can't understand Korea.  How exactly to you get dancing chicks?  I think there is company that hires and trains these girls (by  train I mean teaches them these silly dances to these horrible songs) and then if you're a small business owner who opens a new shop you call them and they send some girls right over.  But that is just my guess. Today I got to teach my nasty class and they were in full lewd form.  The kid who seems to know everything told me today he likes to get blowjobs.  He said that girls do it too slow so then the explained that he grabbed their head and made them do it faster.  Really where does this kid get this stuff?  Then another student explain that a chick bit off his wee-wee.  He was a little offended I think. I'm getting excited about heading to Shanghai.  I'm hoping this tour is a decent one.  For the price you can't beat it with a stick.  The tour itself cost 429,000 won and that includes airfare, hotel, all food, and sightseeing.  I looked up tickets for the flight that we will be taking that same day and the round trip ticket alone costs over 500,000 won.  I'm looking forward to a change in scenery.  They have a really tall tower in Shanghai too so I can't wait to go up in that.   Why am I still so tired?

"2004","1805340","indUnk","            BUTTERFLY EFFECT   Oh my gosh, it's already March n I hafn't done even any single bit of preparation for my projectz. Now the deadlines are drawin' now! The best bit is instead of doing research for my damned IFM (International Fcukin' Module) n R&I (Ridiculous & Idiotic), I'm actually spendin' my time writin' this blog!! This guy (Read: mi!!) really has got no sense of urgency. Dunno whether he realises one small thing he does now can trigger a hella consequences. Speakin' of which, I muz say this show (n i meant 'tHe butteRfLy eFFeCt', duhz!) was terrific! Could easily be my favourite movie of the year!! Great plot, superb cast (Ashton Kutcher + Amy Smart). Shan't further elaborate on the story though. Can juz abstract from any movie review webby.   Been rather slacked all this while. Spent most of my valuable (or izzit?) time online, downloadin' movies, updatin' friendster, check mails, log in icq, log out icq, log in again, look (n literally lookin' only) for online job application. Haix... Really pathetic life sia. BTW, happened to come across this girl, HuiShi, when I sent Guang to the airport. Really coincidental tt I bumped into her, coz nv did expect her to become an air stewardess (but how the hell I know, coz I haf nv spoken to her). Another more interestin' thing is tt the gal who went wif her was from Saints too! N she knows mi! (Though I din know her, but got to know tt she's Janice). Anyway, found her familiar then, but din dare to approach, coz scared later I malu myself (again??). Then dunno how she managed to find mi in friendster! I was so stunned when she messaged mi. It's like, it has nv come across my mind tt I would make an effort to find sumone, esp. when I haf nv spoken to tt person b4, though we used to be in the same pri. skol.   I began to realise one thing. If I haf made the initiative to know her when I was in pri. skol, wat might haf happened. The 'mystery' tt puzzled the both of us is tt though we did not know each other personally, we still remember each other's name! (well, sorta. Except I got HuiShi n ShiHui jumbled up. She's even worse, onli remember I'm sum 'Yi'). But still ok lahz, at least we still recognise each other. If given sum other person from her class, I might not recognise him. Mabbe I was sub-consciously 'payin' more attention' to her in pri. skol bahz. ttz the expaination I found so far. kekeke!  Okay, now to the point. This event set me ponderin'. If I haf the ability to travel back in time (juz like Ashton in the movie), wat aspect of life would I change? A. Get to know HuiShi? (which is pretty dumb coz of the vomit blood after-effect thingy); B. Do sth abt. my 'O'/'A' Levels? (then I can become a scholar, which I sacastically doubt); C. Hold back all the hurtful abuses tt I inflicted on a few individuals? (n I know there's quite a handful of them); D. Remain as it is? (it's onli a fictitious scenerio anyway... yah, i know, i'm a loser here); or E. Sum of the above/ Others? (n this option will look beri familiar to FM students. If u get wat i mean). My instinct would tell mi C. A rationale choice would haf to be D. If I'm dumb/crazy/stupid/lame etc, I would choose A. Lolx!  Being risk-averse (n I'm referin' to the typical kiasee type), D is my final decision (sorta expected). Dun wanna change anything, at least for now. Whoever I fail to know in the past, I will get to know them along the way.

I dun regret hafin said those thingz. An attempt to return to the past would be fruitless, coz I won't say it only once. Juz live wif it bahz. Juz like my philosophy in life: Live as the day passes. Everybody yearns for a perfect endin', but there isn't any perfect endin', is there? u can't please everyone, so f*ck it! Sumtimes, it pays to be selfish. A pity, I'm not. I compromise on the perfection. I'm not even close. Unattainable. Untouchable. Unlikely. Unimaginable.  I dun wanna go back in time. I scared of livin' life once more. I'm resistance to changes. I'm juz a traditional, old-fashion hermit livin' in a world of my own. Moreover, I found my life here. This dimension is where I met my best pals. Dun wanna lose them for anything. We haf come a long way n I really treasure this bond.  thinkin', thinkin', thinkin'.......          ",0
"2005","180519","indUnk","       another successful trombone studio party!!! much drunkeness all around! chairs breaking! packing-peanut throwing! singing along to frank sinatra!   the two funniest things that happened all evening are probably these:  Apparently (i was not present for any of this as I was witnessing the second funny event) LJ and Davis both sat on of the kitchen chairs together, and it started to bend a little. So no one was supposed to sit on it, but Davis forget and did anyway...and it collapsed upon her! She got scared that I would be mad about it, so LJ took it outside and put it in the backyard. Sunday morning I was wandering around the kitchen when I realized that we only had three kitchen chairs...and the other was decidedly absent from all rooms of the house. I shrugged, and walked out the back door only to find the poor chair, disabled, in the grass near the cellar door.   The second funny event involves Sean O'Hara climbing into a large cardboard box and then falling over, spilling styrofoam pellets everywhere. You had to be there. It was hilarious.   There is a good deal of happiness going down in Lauren's life right now. I knew if I whined about being lonely enough someone would pick up on it. Hehe...just kidding.

"2010","1791742","Arts","           I went to look at cameras today--SLR and digital.  I found everything I wanted in both, but not in one camera for what I'm willing to spend.  I film and developing didn't cost anything, I would go with that.  However, that's only in a perfect world where no one would need cameras.  So, I can't go with SLR.  Although, everything I want to do with the camera itself I can do with an SLR.  Digital can do just about everything, but it is still digital.  However, this is what I need when transfering things to a computer anyway.  Although, it is almost four times the cost for me to get in digital what I want in analog.  So, do I settle with: 1) an SLR, constantly pay in money and time for film and developing so that I can have the great lensing, and enjoy capabilities that come with the SLRs 2) go with a low mid-range digital that has mid-level pixel ranges, digital transferring, low post-cost, and no extra lenses or 3) go ahead and spend more money to get a low high-end digital that can use screw-on adaptable lenses that aren't as good as the big analog ones, has extremely high pixel ranges, has digital transferring and all bonuses that come with it, and spend more money than I was wanting, but not near as much as I would if I had it all in one ?  I think I'm going with #3 because I can take a lot of pictures for at least two weeks straight withought having to dump to a computer.  This will be good when I'm out of the country and power is a limited thing.  of course, I'll be going through four AA batteries every 3 days of constant use...  But that's not as expensive as film and developing, and it's instantaneous developing.  (No wait time is good.)  However, it is a stupid amount of money, but I think it will be worth it in the long run.  Of course, I think an SLR would be, too.  I'd get both if I had the money, but I'd also have the high end digital if I had the money, too.  Money.  blah.         ",0

"2012","1785539","Science","       Two things learned from this cold. 1.) They use Sudafed-type products to make crystal meth, or crank if you like.  When you buy it at stores, old women look at you like you're a fiend.  If I had known earlier I would have twitched and asked where the best place to boost was. 2.) Blowing in someones ear and coughing in it produce two different affects. I don't recommend the later. I left work after only one hour today.  Right when I showed up with my head Sudafeded out (I was tweaking!), my nose running and N.I.D. Girl screaming 'Clyde, I think bagels are good', I knew it was going to have to be a sick day.  What clenched it though was N.I.D. Girl turning to me and saying 'This day has been from Poopityville'.  I agree, freak; I'm out. I slept and I had those fun halucanegenic (I don't care if I misspelt that, the dictionary is too heavy to pick up right now) dreams that come with a cold and crank.  I dreamt about dinosaurs and laser tag and for some reason it was fucking important for me to get to the grocery store.  Last night I dreamt that I had stolen a car and moved out to a Pacific Northrwest island to oversee a paper mill.  Anybody with one of them dream analyzing books want to take a stab at those? Today I'm going to avoid sunlight, eat soup and try to ignore the nicotine addiction that is telling me to 'Fuck the chest; light up'.  I know he'll win eventually, just like my thirst for Sudafed will call me out into the Seattle streets looking for meth dealers and drag bars.  I like pretending that I'm skirting the edges of hard drugs by taking these little white pills.  This might be why I eat poppy seed muffins and drink Coke. Last night I watched 'The Burbs' with the comedic brilliance of Younger Tom Hanks.  The movie dragged more than I remember from watching it as a kid, but I blame that on Jerry Bruckheimer.  A great flick for stuffy nights.  Best parts: 'This is Walter!' 'AHHHHHHHH' and Tommy boy coming out of the ruins of the neighbors house. All right, I need to go watch T.V. or do laundry or eat.

"2020","1778822","indUnk","            Sweater's done... well almost  The knitting is officially over, and I have one half sewn together.  I'll work on the other half today and then wash and block it and post a picture later this week.  I think it's going to look ok, this will be the last time I ever use that yarn, and possibly the last time I work with worsted weight.  I've found I much prefer DK and sport weight.    I've got two pairs of socks on the needles right now, the Opal Brasil Strong Heel socks    which have made it past the heel turning onto the never ending foot (size 10), and the second sock of the Mini Mogul Bobble Anklet which is also onto the foot part.  That pattern had a variation of the short row heel, where instead of wrapping the stitches you pick up a strand (like a M1) and knit it together with the short row slipped stitch.  I don't like that method as much as the wrapped one, but it is interesting to learn all the different ways to do the same thing.  I ordered this:   from  urlLink Bea Ellis Knitwear    I just love the sweater on the cover and am going to have to do it one of these days.   I'm planning to get the yarn there too, it's Dale Svale and I've heard very nice things.  I want to check out the pattern first, and decide what size I am.    I also ordered this kit:   from  urlLink White Lies Designs .  I originally saw it in the new  urlLink KnitPicks.com   catalog, and thought 'that looks like one of Joan's designs'.  The designer wasn't credited in the catalog, however, when I looked it up online there she was.  So I eliminated the middle man and bought it direct.  I also have a huge box of sock yarn calling my name.  Somehow between two sock of the month clubs and ordering straight from  urlLink  Germany  I have over 20 pairs just waiting to be made.  I also have several shawl patterns and yarn, and several sport weight cotton sweater patterns and yarn.  Can anyone tell I organized my stash closet last night?

"2036","1741868","indUnk","       (Originally Posted February, 2004)  You take my hand and lead me to the bedroom. Once inside you kiss me softly once just before you silently pull my shirt up over my head. Tossing it casually aside, you turn me around and deftly unhook my bra. I shiver slightly as it easily falls to the floor. Before I can turn back around you've come up behind me lightly kneading my shoulders, then running your hands down my back and around gently stroking my stomach. Ever so slowly you slide your hands up towards my breasts. My breathing increases and I gasp slightly as your hands cup my breasts, gently squeezing, rubbing your thumbs over my taut nipples. Removing your hands, you turn me around, reaching out for the button on my jeans, slowly easing down the zipper, letting your fingers drift down past my panty line, teasing. You hook your thumbs into my belt loops and pull both jeans and panties down over my hips, over my thighs, releasing them at my ankles. While stepping out of the middle of them I kick off my shoes and socks.  You ease me down onto the bed my arms collapse as you push me back. I lay on my back with my hands behind my head, breasts lifted to you inviting you to touch. Your fingers, barely brush my skin, softly caressing along my cheek, down my neck, trailing slowly over my right breast. Across to the other breast, then resting with that nipple snug between your thumb and finger. I reach out to you, as if to help undress, and you gently bat my hand away. Smiling you lean over and kiss me again, still teasing my nipple with your hand, pulling, softly tugging, you lower your head and replace your hand with your mouth. Your tongue flicking, your lips sucking, my nipple hardening with every stroke.  You climb further onto the bed, straddling my stomach, and I reach up hoping to touch any part of you, but you firmly grab my wrists pushing my arms up over my head and me back down onto the bed. It takes only a second to realize that you have me pinned. Holding my wrists with one hand you reveal two silky scarves you must have hidden under the pillow. I struggle only slightly as you somehow manage to trap each wrist with a scarf and secure them each to a bed post.  You smile seductively as you climb over me and off the bed, your hands move to your own shirt undoing the buttons...so slowly...too slowly. I want so badly to touch you and I reach out to you with all my strength, a futile effort as the knots hold. You seem to enjoy watching me struggle as you remove the rest of your clothing, and approach the bed again.  Leaning over slightly you let your fingers drop down between my outstretched legs. You can feel the heat of my anticipation even before you touch my skin. You let your finger glide down between my slippery folds, easily finding my swollen clitoris giving it a light stroke. I nearly cry out at your first touch, squirming, my hands grasping the silk bonds wanting more.  Again that devilish smile, as you climb back onto the bed, straddling my stomach. Noticing my straining against the scarves, you lean forward to test the strength of the knots for yourself. As you lean over I lift my head from the pillow, meeting with success as I gently capture your nipple between my lips. Sucking as much of your breast into my mouth as I can. Yet, clearly having the advantage, you remove it from my mouth and sit back again. I drop my head to the pillow, sighing, frustrated, and again you simply smile.  You lean forward barely brushing my warm lips with your own, then quickly into a passionate kiss, our tongues gently touching, exploring each other. Pushing your thigh between my legs, your hands find my breasts again, caressing softly, fingers lightly tracing around each nipple. You lower your head, flicking one nipple with your tongue as you squeeze the other with your fingers. Your tongue trails over my body as you slide yourself down, kneeling near the end of the bed between my legs.  Ever so slowly you place your outstretched fingers on the tops of my thighs, stroking down lightly, tickling, teasing, your finger tips barely touching my skin. With each light stroke you move slightly in until you are brushing along my inner thighs. Instinctively I part my legs, opening myself up to you. You smile again as you can't help but notice how wet I am. You look up at me and see my breasts nearly heaving with every breath. Our eyes meet and you can see the pleading look on my face. Every touch of your fingers feels like fire dancing across my bare skin. I squirm, begging for your touch. I close my eyes, dropping my head back down to the pillow as I tremble in anticipation.  I want you to touch me, to taste me, anything to stop the merciless throbbing between my legs. Yet you wait. Finally as you lower your head I can feel your hot breath on my legs and the outer lips of my wet and waiting sex. My hands grasp the silk bonds pulling, straining, but I can't move closer to you. My legs open even wider and I unconsciously thrust my hips trying to make some sort of contact. With a little laugh you pull your head away prolonging the tease. I squirm and beg incoherently when at last I feel a soft wetness pushed between my lower lips. I nearly faint as all the nerves tingle through my body. Your tongue teasing gently, entering me, exploring.  An uncontrollable moan escapes my lips as you move your tongue up to tease my clit, and your fingers seek out my swollen lips. Moisture coats your fingers as you delve between the folds of soft skin. First one finger enters my body, then a second, stroking deeper, pumping slowly as you continue to flick your tongue across my clit. My hips thrust again bucking against your hand and mouth, I can't take this, I'm begging you to move faster ... harder ... deeper.  You lower your head sucking my clit into your mouth, running your tongue in circles around it, pumping furiously with your fingers deep inside me. A flush flows over my perspiration soaked body as my muscles contract. I hear a cry release, it is my own, as my back arches and my entire body spasms with pleasure.  I can barely breathe as you crawl back up to look me in the eyes. Lowering your face to mine you kiss me deeply. I can taste myself on your lips and tongue, but I don't mind. It only rekindles the fire....reminding me that soon I will be the one making you cry out in pleasure......if only I can get my hands free!          ",0
"2037","1739757","indUnk","             I sometimes feel like I am becoming jaded, losing my rose-colored vision, and I am not sure whether it is a good thing or a bad thing.  The things that used to inspire me don't always do it anymore. I just read an article about the beauty of the Orthodox world, how it makes everything so meaningful and beautiful, and my first reaction was to think that the author was really naive.  That bothers me so much, not that the author describes Orthodoxy as meaningful, because I find that to be true, but that I had such a negative reaction to what I was reading. A few years ago, when I was first starting to become religious, I believed it all. I believed that wearing long-sleeved shirts in the middle of 100-degree whether showed dignity. I believed that Orthodox families were more well-behaved, loving and supportive of its members than the outside world. Maybe I have seen too much of the dark, hurtful side that is out there, but I am finding it hard to believe any more.  Now, I know that all of the dark things that are in the Orthodox world are in the secular world also, and in an even greater measure. I have, in a lot of ways, cut myself off from that outside world that didn't make me happy to begin with. In fact, it really made me unhappy for a long time. I don't desire to be part of that world again, because I found it to be devoid of meaning and purpose. But I am worried that I don't find what I have chosen as inspirational and uplifting as I once did.  I know you need balance in life, and you can't stay on a high forever. Maybe this feeling is normal. Maybe I am not jaded, just a bit more realistic than I used to be. I still feel that what I have chosen for my life is the right path, and I can't imagine going back, don't want to even think about going back. But sometimes I wish I had those rose-colored glasses again.  Have a good Shabbos!          ",0

"2040","1723046","Religion","       Today seems like Monday. It has been a VERY LONG weekend! I have lost some days somewhere.  The funeral went ok yesterday. I was really concerned about what the preacher would say but I was impressed. As most do at a funeral, he talked on the 23rd Psalm. He didn't say anything about where Jim was now. He talked about how Jesus would be with us and hold our hand, etc. through lifes tests and trials. Then if we have a personnal relationship with Jesus, we would go to heaven when we die and spend eternity with Him. It was short and really good. He never said much about Jim at all. He only said that we all have our own memories of him and left it at that.  I am physically, spiritually and emotionally weak right now. I haven't been in church for 2 weeks nor Bible study. Last week, I didn't have a TV or computer, so I didn't have my 'daily devotionals' like I always do. With the 'neighbors' we had at Indiana Beach, all the kids and then the lupus flare, I wasn't in the Bible like I wanted to be nor did I have much quiet time with the Lord. It has taken a toll on me spiritually. It doesn't matter how long you have been a Christian or how strong you may be in the Lord, when you don't spend that time with Him and be fed, you will slip backwards.  My van is still broken. It has been 3 weeks now. Nobody seems to have time to fix it. So I am still stranded at home. I have to go to the hospital tomorrow to have the test done to see if I have a blood clot in my leg. Guess I will get my power chair or 'race car' as Pastor Bill called it, and ride it into town! It was great having it last week. That is why I got to actually go to the beach and be in the sun that caused the lupus flare! Oh, what fun it is to be 'free'!  I missed going to the jail again last night. I have missed the last 2 now. The Country/Western outreach is in 3 weeks and I haven't even started on it yet. We were suppose to start adopt-a-block in Sept. but can't seem to get people together to have the training meeting and go out with those who have been doing it for awhile now. Now I am wondering if it is God or if it is just satan trying to stop it. Some of the people that were wanting to do it has dropped out and it has left only 3 of us. Two of which can't walk and has to use 'race cars'. What good will that be? So guess I will just wait and see what happens.  I have been praying about getting a job to help out financially. I don't know what I can do but there has to be something out there. We sure didn't need all these hospital and Dr. bills. Thank God  my Dr. gives me samples of the few medications I take and we don't have to buy them too. Winter is just around the corner and I don't think we can go through another winter like last year. Work has been good this summer but we have been playing that catch up game and not been able to get anything ahead. So I'm not sure yet what I am suppose to do. The ministry will have to be put on hold if I get a job. There is no way that my body can take both. So I am still praying about what I am suppose to do at this point. I know God will supply my needs but I have to do my part first.  It is time to stop and rest for a day or two. I feel so drained right now and I need time with God desperately.              ",0

"2044","1713442","Education","    urlLink INFORMATION LITERACY FOR THE SKEPTICAL LIBRARY DIRECTOR  This is by Patricia S. Breivik.  IT was presented at the 2000 IATUL Conference Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia 3rd - 7th July, 2000.  From the site:  In the United States in the 1980s, there was a major educational reform effort that focused on both K-12 and higher education. During those years it seemed that every organization that had anything to do with education, and a lot that had nothing to do with education, wrote a report on how the educational system in America was not working and recommended how things should change. One of the things that was really remarkable about these reports which tapered off at the end of the 80's (so we're talking only 20 years ago) was that only two of them mentioned libraries. Not only did they not mention libraries, they didn't mention information technology. They didn't even mention the Information Age, even though Alvin Toffler 1 years before had sent out the alert that we were in the Information Age. So it was remarkable that so many brilliant people, or at least people who thought they were brilliant, could be suggesting how to reform education while ignoring the world in which current and all future generations were going to live and work.  So in a spirit of frustration and concern Bob Wedgeworth, who was at one time Executive Director of the American Library Association and at that time Dean of the library school at Columbia, and I got together. I had called him and said, â€œWe need to change higher education; and, if you want to be part of doing that, let's meet for breakfast before you fly back to New York City.â€ I remember that he laughed and said â€œWell, you're not going to tell me anything more about this are you?â€ and I replied â€œNo, not until we meet.â€ We got together the next morning and came up with an idea. It was for a one time collaboration between the University of Colorado, where I was working, and Columbia University. With support form the CU President and others at Columbia, we organized a higher education summit. We also invited not only librarians, but the highest, most prestigious people from higher education including Ernie Boyer, whom some of you may know. His book, College: the Undergraduate Experience in America 2 came out very late in the reform effort and was the only one which envisioned a role for libraries in the improvement of learning. In it he said it was important for students to spend as much time in the library as they did in the classroom learning how to use the whole range of information resources. We invited this esteemed higher education leader, and he came! And others did too. Going into the conference, we didn't know what would happen. Would they just laugh at us? That was a possibility, but we also knew that nothing would change if we did not take the risk. Then we locked them away in old New York Governor Harriman's estate on the Hudson River, and for three days we talked about the role of libraries in quality education.  Out of the conference came a book 3, but more importantly out of it came the beginning of the information literacy movement, as we know it today. One of the people at that conference was Margaret Chisholm, the incoming president of the American Library Association, and she called me and said, â€œThis is too important to stop here. And it's got to be expanded to include K-12. Do you think we can get together a prestigious enough group of educational leaders to come together with librarians to continue this dialogue?â€ And that's what we did. We recruited to the effort people like the Executive Director of the American Association of School Administrators and the Executive Director of the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education. Seven education leaders came together with six librarians and produced in 1989 the ALA Presidential Committee on Information Literacy Final Report 4 which was released in Washington, DC, as part of the ALA Midwinter meeting at a press conference.

"2045","1713442","Education","        urlLink The Impact of Work-Based Learning on Students. ERIC Digest.   This ERIC Digest is by Michael Wonacott.  It deals with work-based learning.  From the ERIC Digest:  Typically, studies of approaches to CTE integrating WBL with traditional academics do not attempt to isolate the effects of different components of the approach on the outcomes examined; consequently, conclusions are not and cannot be drawn on the impact of WBL activities per se. However, studies that do address the specific effects of WBL report an association between the extent or intensity of WBL activities and poorer school performance. Haimson and Bellotti (2001), for example, reported that STW students holding internships--or jobs--and working more than 20 hours per week have slightly lower GPAs than other students. Kaufman et al. (2000) found that HSTW schools in which more students participated in work-based internships or vocational teachers spent more time using outside experts to evaluate student work showed slight but statistically significant decreases in academic achievement. Both studies clearly state the caveat that poorer academic achievement may result from preexisting factors; nevertheless, they recommended caution in implementing WBL. This recommendation echoed the traditional wisdom about the effects of working during high school (reviewed in Stern 1997). Although findings vary, most agree that students who worked intensively (i.e., 15-20 hours per week or more) tended to have lower grades, do less homework, be more likely to drop out, and be less likely to complete postsecondary education. These costs must be balanced against such benefits as immediate earnings, increased likelihood of employment and higher earnings in the short term after high school, and a long-term increase in positive orientation to work.    However, that conventional wisdom has been brought into question in an analysis (Warren et al. 2000) of data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, a survey of a nationwide sample of students who were eighth-graders in 1998. Warren et al. used a simultaneous equation model to investigate both short-term and long-term effects and the possibility of a reciprocal relationship between employment of any kind--WBL or otherwise--during high school and grades in academic courses. Researchers found no evidence that working during high school affected grades in academic courses either in the short term (i.e., during the same academic year) or in the long term (two academic years later) or that students' grades affected their employment activities. Instead, researchers found that preexisting differences between students who worked intensively and those who did not (in socioeconomic status, grades, academic achievement, postsecondary education aspirations, and curriculum track) accounted for the association between employment intensity and grades in academic courses.

After all, he was not Washington, Lincoln, or Kennedy.    But then, he never had a chance to prove himself.    Garfield was only in office for two-hundred days when he fell into the hands of his killers - the medical profession.

"2050","1709540","Communications-Media","            It's Sunday evening. I've had an excellent weekend of eating, drinking and wandering, as well as sleeping. Lots of sleeping. I decided that I should go get some coffee and go write. I head to everyone's favorite Adams-Morgan coffeeshop, and don't expect it to be crazy busy at 5 p.m. on a Sunday. It wasn't packed but I had to share a seat. Not so bad. The people I'm sitting with leave, and I take over the loveseat.     &nbsp;  A man comes over and asked me if the seat is taken and I say no. I go back to writing. He is talking rather loudly on his cell phone. I soon realize he is reading what I'm writing. I fucking hate that. I know Curiosity so well she is my middle name, however, I'd appreciate some common sense and respect here. Then he starts talking to me. He asks which waitress is ours. Perfectly reasonable question. I point her out, save my work, and shut down my 'puter. I figured I can at least drink my tea and read. 'Hey so, I don't mean to be rude, but you seem very familiar. . .' I quite visibly roll my eyes, but he goes on. 'Yeah I worked for awhile over at Heaven &amp;amp; Hell, you ever go there? You familiar with the area?' 'Nope, sorry.'    &nbsp;  &nbsp;I try go back to reading, but he extends his hand, introduces himself and says again how familiar I look. Why do I attract the freaks? I'm wearing a blank tank, my indie hipster glasses, dark raddy jeans, and a bandanna around my very dirty hair. I look just about as hippy/indie/grungy as I get. I look like I should be chainsmoking outside the Velvet Lounge waiting for it to open five hours before it actually does. It's like when Navy guys don't understand why I don't want to do shots with them, as I sing along the lyrics to a Patti Smith song on the jukebox. Social cues people!     &nbsp;  'Do you like to go out? You like to go dancing?' 'No.' Not a 'nah,' not a 'nope,' not a 'eh...' but a flat out no. No.  No!!!      &nbsp;  I go back to reading. The waitress comes over, I ask for my check. I pay. I leave.     &nbsp;  The kicker is that he was holding and 'reading' some book about 'how to read people.' What about my body language didn't he understand? The back turned to him, the open book, the slowness to respond, the rolling eyes, the negative answers??? Jesus.     &nbsp;  The WiFi wasn't working at that place so I headed down to my new favorite spot to check email and whatnot. The owner who is usually there doesn't speak much but greets me with a smile. I get my usual, and headoutside. There is chatter at the tables, but one large table is filled with six or seven deaf people who chatter excitedly with their hands. Other tables seat friends, or strangers who need a seat, sitting and reading, drinking, smoking and minding their own business.     &nbsp;  I put on my headphones, and watch the people go by.     &nbsp;  Now I remember why I come here first.     &nbsp;          ",0

"2058","1689280","indUnk","             This is a tip from my cousin-in-law, Ate Jenny! She and her hubby, my Kuya Bee-Boy, are expecting a baby next year. They're trying to squeeze in some personal time together now, way before the baby arrives. :) She has a point! Once the baby comes, there might not be enough time to go on those romantic dates anymore. It'll all be about the baby! So now, they try to watch at least 3 movies a week.   I think that's a great idea. January's coming along, the future-grannies (my Mom and H's mom) are asking me almost everyday about their future grandchild, my biological clock's going berserk, and H always grabs the chance to spend time with our 8-yo-cousin, Max. I think we're gonna have a baby first quarter next year (cross those fingers!) so we might as well get into movie marathon mode already. :D Ooooh. And well, it's the Metro Manila Film Festival soon... maybe we can start with that!  P.S. Another thing I was thinking of was Discovery Suites' Wellness Package. It's a weekend for two at their hotel, with body scrubs, meals and massages in the package. I'll check it out sometime... looks like a very relaxing and very interesting holiday gift for both of us busy bumblebees.         ",0

It's unfortuante that FOX completely mishandled that franchise, it had the potential to leave the Simpson's in its wake.  Instead it got moved around, preempted, and evetually cancelled.  It  was  the funniest animated show, hands down, and, some would argue, the funniest show period.  I'll let you be your own judge of that.  But the good news is that the recherchÃ© people at  urlLink [Adult Swim]  had the presence of mind to pick up the syndication rights.  So they can keep us hip deep in unequivocal animated goodness.  (I guess we should thank those copycatting fucks over at TBS, too)  But for a more permanent solution go purchase the  urlLink DVD .  (season 2 comes out this week)  Also, write an angry missive to your congressman and get him to provide federal funding to foster this show.  Do it now, I can wait.  Conversely, the one hour block [Adult Swim] uses to show  urlLink Futurama  and  urlLink Family Guy  is doing exceptionally well.  So well, in fact, that their has been discussions of Cartoon-Network-Funded new episodes of both shows.

As far as the cool points poll is concerned, the only person to closely identify last weeks question was not eligible for the list, although he is quite cool.  So here is this week's question:  You can recieve a scholaship for knowing what made up language?  This question is worth three (3) cool points.  I haven't seen any dead bodies this week, but it's only Monday so we won't count out the possibility just yet.  The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King sweeps at the Oscars.  11 noms, 11 wins.  Way to go Peter Jackson and Co.  Nobody has swept since 1988 (The Last Emperor) and before that it was 1958 (Gigi).  They also tied an Academy Award record with 11 statues.  In 1997 Titanic won 11 and in 1958 Ben-Hur won 11.  I'm glad that fantasy can finally be seen as a viable genre now.  I know that the three films combined to make over 2.5 billion (worldwide) at the box office, and probably several hundred million more in DVD sales - but nobody really wants to take the chance and spend 100 mill making the movie right in fear that they won't make their money back.  Now that this movie kicked ass and took names at the Oscars, I feel that we'll continue to see the fantasy genre flourish, at least that's my hope.  I love me some wizards and dragons and fucking swords and shit.  Now that we have that out of the way let me move onto the reason I'm pissed at the Motion Picture Academy.  Sean Penn wins best actor?!  Who was smoking what when they doled out that special little piece of torture upon america?  I don't want anyone to think I'm biased here, but how in the fuck do you not only pass up Johnny Depp, but also Bill Murray?  I wonder if they even watched these fucking movies?  Johnny Depp may have given the single best performance ever as Captain Jack Sparrow, and if were giving out sympathy-been-shunned-one-too-many-times Oscars (in the case of Penn) then why not give it to Bill Murray?  His body of work is far superior to Sean Penn's.  I blame fucking Russell Crowe for the whole goddamn thing.  Sean Penn should have won it for I Am Sam, but they had to give it to Crowe for Gladiator, which was a fine picture to be sure, but did you see I Am Sam?  Penn was brilliant.  All Crowe did was bring a strong presence to an otherwise prosaic role.  If Penn had won like he was supposed to, then you can bet your ass Johnny Depp or Bill Murray wins last night.  While we are on the subject, there is no way that Charlize Theron was better in Monster than Naomi Watts was in 21 Grams.  No. Fucking. Way.  And I like Charlize.  But Naomi was off the fucking chart.  And she gets robbed like a Times Square hooker.  Oh well, at least that's not as depressing as Bill and Johnny getting robbed.  That was a crime.  A crime, I tell you!  But I digress.   The Yellow Dart has spoken.  'I'll read you poetry, I'll tell you what I know to be true // I'll make a sentimental observation 'bout the moon // I'll kiss you so that you can think that kisses are sublime //  But I won't spend a penny, cause all that your worth is my time.'

One of Italy's best commedian artists Sabina Guzzanti made recently a great show called Rai8t. The show was simply superb and it hurts only the fact that if you like to hear a good critique today one has to look for a comedy show. Too bad that the best get banned or 'warned' to mind their words. All this hiding behind excuses that Rai is a public company so that all sides have to be represented. HA! If you like to represent all sides thay can make more good shows with different sides and not copies of the 'competition' (read Mediaset) aired in the same timeslots of the respective counterparts!

Watching them perform their rituals of greeting and flirting. Some guarding their words, holding hands in front of their mouths to protect the conversations from his ears. As if he even cares what those ones have to say. The people that talk openly and freely are the characters that interest him. He likes to listen to their chatter. Sometimes he even sketches them in his book. Their faces and body movements. He even draws speech bubbles for fragments of their conversations. The best time of all is when he only hears a single sentence or phrase from the people passing by. Then he can make up a whole story based on that one snippet. That tiny fragment explodes in his mind. New characters form, mouthing the strangest dreams. These scare him as well. When he flicks back into his book, he can't remember which of the words were real and which he made up. Maybe all he was doing was copying down everything. Making nothing new at all. Blindly composing words that have already been used. Drawings of grotesque faces that he doesn't recognise. Malformed bodies writhing on the white page, that should be marked return to sender. Yet when he captures them in pen and ink, they seem so real, holding the moment as he sees it. Perhaps someone is wiping the pages clean, and putting these fantastical creatures there. Or maybe once captured, the pressing between the pages of his book distorts their form. Either way, he tries not to flip backwards. Keeps the pages closed tight. Opens to a new fresh sheet each day. Hides the demons away. So he sits. Nib poised. Listening. Observing. Watching as people close themselves as they approach, watch them ignore him. Nod to the laughs, smile to the stares. Whispering cold dreams and hot nightmares. Ready to sketch you into his book and hold you there.  ",0
"2090","1640282","Communications-Media","   You know the writer. You know the talk-show host. You know the TV personality. You know the co-worker.  Something tragic happens that, either directly or indirectly, involves the world of sports. Something like, for example, the untimely death of a well-known sports figure (Derrick Thomas would be an easy example). Or a tragedy so deep and overwhelming that it causes the cancellation or postponement of one or more sporting events (9/11 would be an example, but so would any number of landfalling hurricanes and other weather calamaties).  'Wow. This really puts sports in perspective,' the person says.   'This is real life. Sports mean nothing at a time like this,' they go on to say. 'It changes how I look at the things in life I prioritize.'  And you just want to smack the guy in the head every time the words are said or written.  Sports are what they are: Entertainment. A diversion from real life. A way to wind down after a long day of work. Fun. No one who follows sports for a living or is truly devoted to sports would dare think any more of sports.  I get sick and tired of people who make the 'This puts sports in perspective' comment after something bad happens. I heard no fewer than a dozen people, some of them actually involved in sports, make the comment after word was received of Pat Tillman's death on Friday. No one wants to diminish what Tillman did or what his sacrifice means to all of us. But it does nothing to 'put sports in perspective'.  They're already in perspective. You don't see Yankees-Red Sox highlights leading the national news over people getting ambushed in Fallujah. You don't hear the call of Calgary's overtime game-winning goal before you hear about deadly tornadoes in Oklahoma.   I don't need to be told about the meaning of sports in this real-life world of ours. Sports has a place for me, and for a lot of people, and we're not stupid enough to think they're more important than war...or anything else. They're our way of forgetting, even if it's for three hours, about all the bad things happening around the world. ",0

I have not come up with the solution for abolishing poverty, starvation, or war, but....I made someone smile today.  Smiles make the world a happy place.  2.  What fashion trend are you glad that's gone away? Or what trend are you waiting to go away?    The blue swipe of eyeshadow above the eyes.  Ohhh that was gross.  And glitter, glitter everywhere, on the back, on the boobs, on the face, in the hair, ohhh  so glad it's gone. What, what did you say?  It's not gone? Who, what, where?  Ohhh, that's ok, they are from either Johnston, R.I. or Chalmette, LA.  Heheheeee!  3.  What's your greatest sports moment, your own or one you've witnessed?  My greatest sports moment.....It has to be when I played softball.  Ohhh, it was quite a few years ago.  Anyway, we were in the finals and needed to win this game.  I was in left field (I know, they put me there, I am not a great player, but I have fun, ok).  It was the 9th inning, we were ahead by 1. Well, guess what....there was a pop up, and it was heading my way.  I positioned myself under the ball, I saw it coming, I had my glove up and I was ready.  It was like floating and I could hear my teammates yelling for me to catch it.  I glanced up and the lights blinded me, I lost the ball and I moved my glove to try and find it.  Well I found it alright, square in the middle of my forehead.  I remember looking up and I couldn't figure out why I was feeling damp on my back.  I was flat on my back in the grass.  Though I did suffered a knot in the middle of my forehead, and somehow a black eye, we came thru and won the game. As you can tell, I am ready for the pros.  4.  Who would you nominate for the most annoying person award?  This list may be long, there are so many to choose from and I vote that they are placed on an island far, far away....cuz they bug the crap out of me! Kid Kradic in the morning-he is a radio jockey out of Baton Rouge, he is irritating and I don't listen to him anymore. Brittany Spears-Talk about dirty, skank, nasty! I am not yet a woman, bullshit.  Pull up your pants you slut! That guy on Trading Spaces Family-Who is he? He is not funny, he is lame. Get off the show, you bug me! That jerk that tried to run me off the road yesterday....you better have insurance asswipe! People that whine about something and don't do anything to change it...Shut up! and lastly, but not the lowest on my list....all you idiots that bitch about our country and how awful it is to live here....You know what, LEAVE!  We don't need you!  5.  What do you do to get yourself ready to write? Either blogging or other writing?   I masturbate! Yup! Relieves all that tension, makes me feel wonderful.  Helps me spew the afterglow!  6.  Mac or PC or Linux? Why?  PC...why?  It's free!  My brother-in-law helped me build mine and he gave me all the parts.  Free! Free!

"2094","1636651","indUnk","       Plan for today was to go home after work, change into something comfortable and head over the restaurant where the cute girl works.  I sent D an Email to meet me after work, I needed a little sugar and a pep talk. As I waited in the parking lot of the designated spot, my phone rang. Son asked me to pick him up after work, the time he said was for 5 O'clock.  I said sure, it was on my way and I knew it wouldn't interrupt my original plan. Not 2 minutes after I hung up with him, my mom called.  She wanted to know what time I needed to be picked up to go to my niece's Graduation.  I think I said 'Crap' out loud.  She immediately coped an attitude telling me, if I had more important plans then not to bother.  Grrrrr. I waited 15 minutes for D, I finally figured he didn't get my Email and wasn't showing.  So I headed out because I was getting short on time. As I hit Power Blvd, my daughter called and needed to be picked up, she was actually on my way too, so I said for her to be waiting outside or I was driving by.  My time was getting thin. Then D called and wanted to know where I was.  He was at our meeting spot and waiting.  At that point I was about to burst into tears. I felt like everyone wanted me everywhere all at the same time and I was slipping into insanity. D said not to worry about him and to try and have a good night anyway. I picked up graduation present for the niece, my daughter, ended up driving her boyfriend to work, went to the pick up place for my son and after 30 minutes he called and said he was getting a different ride. Fantastic....it was already 5:40 and mom was picking me up at 6:15.  I still needed some food, a change of clothes and to wrap the present. I did it though, I was ready and waiting(she was late).   I must say, the graduation was great.  I am glad I went.  There is only one kindergarten graduation for a child and if you miss it, she will let you know about it.  As for the cute girl.  I stopped by the restaurant on my way home.  She wasn't there.  I don't know if she had been and left for the evening already or she just wasn't working.  I was to chicken to ask.  I think things turned out for the best tonight.  If I had gone over to the restaurant and she wasn't working, I may have been disappointed.  This way, I at least saw Caroline sing and dance and get her little diploma.  Sometimes Family obligations are more important.  Saturday, there will be no Family obligations.  I have already informed those that would listen that I will not be in town all weekend.  Not saying I will be away, I will just be unavailable.  My phone will be off and my car parked down the street.   This is a three day 'me' weekend.          ",0

He died 20 years ago from what I believe was bone cancer. It was in his hip.  And for my entertainment on the run? Harry Potter, Year 1. Watching Years one and two again in preparation for Year Three, coming soon to theaters near you. Can't wait!   Today's miles: 4.3   Total so far: 38.09   Still to go for goal: 461.91   We have the big team meeting this afternoon. Of the fourteen on the team, I'm counting eleven that will be in attendence. Not bad! We will be filling out the schedule for who will be on the track when during the Relay, who will be working at the hot dog stand next weekend when, and answering questions if anybody has any. I had hoped that some of the kids could work on luminarias, but I guess those haven't arrived at County Market yet.   I had one of 'those nights' last night. Don't know where it came from. All I know is that I had to pick Kel up at a party at midnight and when usually I'm dragging and having a hard time keeping myself awake for that duty, last night I was wide awake -  wide awake...  And at 3 am I was lying in bed blinking around at the dimly lit room wondering what the heck I was doing still wide awake. So I got back up. My mind was going a hundred miles an hour on fifty things so I got up and wrote some of it down. At 4 I went back to bed, did the old count backwards from 100 trying to relax into sleep and was still blinking up at the ceiling as the room began to grow light at 5:30.  Wide awake.  Around 6:15 I realized I was drifting. I drifted in and out until 8 when Keith got out of bed. And then again until 10. I feel fine now. Like I had a perfectly normal night's sleep, but we'll see how long that lasts.  I took Claritin D nondrowsy formula yesterday afternoon for the first time in years. Sudafed will keep me up all night. Maybe this had the same effect. But I have to admit, after taking it, I felt more normal health-wise than I have in about three weeks. I've been wandering around in a headachy and awful fog with a stiff neck, and such. I've been tired and just dragging. And in all that time I've taken regular Claritin. Without the D. I had to stop taking the D a while back because of my high blood pressure and other meds I was on. I've gotten the bp down and stopped the other meds, so... I felt really good again from one dose of Claritin D. Couldn't beat that. Going to stop and check my bp today and see if it had any impact because I want my allergies to be this in control.  Okay. Bored my loyal reader enough. Just commenting on my bizarre lack of sleep and possible cause thereof. Couldn't have possibly been the triple shot espresso mocha drank around noon (too early) or the two and a half tiny cups of green tea at dinner with my favorite Vietnamese food from Duc's around 6 (too little).

While I was cooling from the hottub and getting ready to run, we had a big old roll of thunder! That was cool!   I actually didn't feel any pain in my leg at all while I was running. The only thing that hurt was after I finished stretching. I have to remember to leave out one of the stretches. It's one we were told not to do back in high school cross country anyway...

"2103","1620182","Technology","                 Ugh.  This meeting has just re-enforced a thought I that came to me earlier this morning:  Specification by committee does not work.   Specification is very, very important, true.  But when you try to determine what a product should do in a group discussion, things don't work out.  Here's why:     Experts are rare.   It's entirely unlikely that you will be able to gather a group of experts in the field that your product addresses.   There is no BEST solution.   Even if there was a 'best solution,' the metrics required to accurately measure the differences between solutions does not exist.   Group discussions among non-experts go nowhere.   This wastes time.  It's true that your specification period should consume a large portion of your development cycle, but not ALL OF IT! So what's the solution?  Specification by mandate.  You should have one or two people who are experts in your product's field.  They should know the market, what users you are trying to address, and where your product falls in with your company's other products.  With this in mind, the expert should develop the product specifications, run them through some sort of approval process, and then hand them to the developers for implementation.

I mean, I can understand the whole holiday spirit and cheer and whatever, but the whole thing means nil to me. However, I did watch so many hours on the Discovery Channel about the life of Jesus, Mary, and everything else surrounding the New Testament that the Disocovery Channel could muster. I watched so many hours, in fact, that I had a dream last night that I was Mary, Noah (of the Arc), and Jesus rolled into one.   For Xmas eve I went over to my friend Ridge's house in Queens. We watched Peanuts cartoons, Edward Scissorhands, and ate Jumbalya or whatever it's called/spelled. Afterwards I headed back into the city a little earlier than planned and had a quick drink with Marc. I also tried to climb into his suitcase so he could take me to Australia with him for when he goes to interview the Vines. As I was heading back home, my brother Lawrence called me just as I was driving past him on the street in my cab. I jumped out and joined him for a drink at some cheesy club that was hosting a Matzoh Ball. It was so incredibly lame (I yelled out 'Sausage Fest!' as i walked in and got shot with dirty looks all around) that we left after 20 minutes. He headed off to the new Crobar and I went home. Apparently the Lubuvatch Organization were in their Mitzvah Mobile outside of Crobar trying to recruit new followers of the ultra-orthodox jewish cult-like group. When I was little my mom used to take me to visit Rabbi Schneerson (sp?) who is the person the Lubuvatch's look up to as a sort of profit. We'd wait in a long line in Brooklyn for hours and hours and walk up to him, hand him a dollar, he'd give us a blessed dollar in return, mumble something or another, and then we'd go off on our way. I was about 8 years old when we did this, so my memory is a bit cloudy... however, I'm sure he brought happiness to a lot of people. I'm just confused by what the Lubuvatch community is trying to do with their Mitzvah Mobiles... i should do some research.   Speaking of Lawrence, he changed his friendster photo to images from high school. He was so fucking cute and new wave.  urlLink Look! .

I couldn't eat it cause it wasn't kosher, but basically it was chicken rolled with ricotta and feta cheese, mashed potatoes, and asparagus. Nate cooks! He's like the best boy in the whole world. He also got a Christmas tree for the apartment which he decorated with white lights and blue balls (to pay respect to Hannukah), and we made an angle for the top using an image of Thom Yorke i found in Blender magazine.  After dinner I went to the movies with Karen and Jordan to see 'Big Fish' (I was crying like a pms-ing girl who has just watched a Sally Struthers 'kids in africa need your money' commercial at the end... not to mention squealing everytime Ewan came on screen). We all noticed Drew and Fab in line for popcorn behind us and so this prompted Jordan to ask quite loudly while we were sitting down 'I THOUGHT DREW AND FAB WERE OVER?' not noticing them sitting two rows directly in front of us. God Bless Jordan for delivering the quote of the night. So Drew and Fab are back on!    When I got home, after going to Lit, I watched the World Idol competition that i had taped while at the movies.

The greatness of the site was brought home to me while talking to Allen at the World Fantasy Convention. The projects in process--a long essay on Kafka, possible short fiction reviews, expansion of the book reviews section, etc.--and an off-the-cuff comment Allen made about how, for example, Borges fans think the Borges section of the site is the entire site (when in fact there's a huge Joyce section, a huge Marquez section, etc.) really made me re-appreciate a site I might have begun to take for granted.

"2111","1604755","indUnk","                 When the idea for  The Thackery T. Lambshead Pocket Guide to Eccentric & Discredited Diseases  first came up, I had no idea that it would eventually consume my life. And yet here it is, the end of June, and I conservatively estimate that I have spent over 1,000 hours editing the Guide, proofreading the Guide, reading submissions for the Guide, and much else.  The first thing you learn about editing a fake disease guide (rather, co-editing; Mark Roberts is my co-editor--he also created this wonderful site for the Guide:  urlLink http://www.lambsheadguide.com ) is that you might as well consider yourself the editor of a  real  medical guide. It's just as much work, you're just as concerned about the veracity of the entries (although in a different sense), and the minute details of cross-referencing and copy editing for consistency are the same as well.  And yet, at the end of it all, I'm still not qualified to edit a real medical guide. In looking back over the years spent working on the Guide--literally,  years --I cannot help but wonder if it's become a form of madness. (Take for instance the frenzy involved in getting one disease translated into Spanish so we could provide an excerpt, in the original layout, of a supposed Spanish version of a related book edited by Borges. Is this sanity? Probably not.)  The tendency of many people may be to dismiss the Guide as a gimmick, and yet Mark and I have been careful to reject those submissions that seemed gimmicky. In a sense, some of those potential contributors who did not take the humorous aspect  seriously  found themselves left out in the cold. We don't have a series of 'civilization is a disease' or 'death is a disease' jokes in this book. We have some entries that make fun of medical jargon, or of doctors, or of hospitals. But we don't have entries that function as jokes first and disease entries second. The result has been a much richer blend of material than anyone expected at the beginning of the project. Of course, with this richness has come a complexity that demands attention to detail. Thus the apparatus of forewords, introductions, examples from prior editions of the guide, an obscure history of the 20th century from the viewpoint of the guide--all of this grows up around the entries, like some oddly beneficial application of barnacles to a ship's hull. Before you know it, it all looks very natural and organic indeed.  The interesting thing about the Guideâ€”the idea of it and the sampler that weâ€™ve already published in advance of the Guide itselfâ€”is how  therapeutic  it seems to be. People who are ill have found the humor in it to be very life-affirming for them. Doctors have found it to be stress-relievingâ€”in fact, a couple of medical schools may add the book to their curriculum for stress-relief courses. (I think it was Angela Carter, the brilliant English novelist and short story writer, who said that one way to cheat death was to laugh at it, to belittle it. She said this while she was dying of lung cancer.) Weâ€™ve also been sensitive to the fact that, on one level, thereâ€™s nothing funny about disease. Several of the entries in the Guide are very serious.  I'm thinking about the Guide because I'm living it right now, but also because the preproduction phase will end soon. If not by July 1st, then shortly thereafter. My engagement with the Guide will become different than it has been. The words themselves have been forever ruined by the repeated reading, re-reading, and re-reading again--the sheer repetition of the reading has transformed the words in the entries into another language. Or made the combinations of words unintelligible to me. You could read one of the entries and it would sound like the numbers from the New York Stock Exchange read back in Arabic.  This is one of the most disappointing aspects of editing an anthology: you don't get to enjoy it. However, because the Guide is so visual--because the designer John Coulthart has incorporated an illustration for each disease, among other things--I get a second chance. I will be able to enjoy the book on a visual level even though I can never read it again.  When I hold it in my hands and open it, I will simultaneously think to myself, 'You are mad' and 'You have helped to create something totally unique.'  Jeff             ",0

"2117","1593902","Student","            Hello, Moon Has America's low-rise obsession gone too far? By Amanda Fortini   America is in the throes of a crack epidemic. Sitting in a booth with a friend at an excruciatingly hip restaurant in downtown Manhattan a few weeks ago, I glanced up to see a fleshy forest of crevices and multiple folds of skin and G-strings that three women in their late 20s were displaying for the world. It was then that I knew: This low-rider style has gone too far.   On the street, on television, even in the office, women of all ages and sizes are wearing tight, low-slung, butt-hugging jeans and pants that hit at, or often far below, the hip. The trend isn't newâ€”it began around '95 or soâ€”but what is new are the unlovely depths to which the pants have now, as it were, sunk. The crotch-to-waist measurement, or rise, on a standard pair of jeans (the sort we haven't seen much of since the early '90s) is somewhere between 10 and 12 inches. Early low-riders had a rise of about 7 inches. Over the past couple of years, the rise has dipped as low as 3 or 4 inches. Low-rise, it seems, has become synonymous with no-rise. Gasoline, a Brazilian company, has even created Down2There jeans, which feature a bungee cord that allows the wearer to lower her pants as she sees fit, as though adjusting a set of Venetian blinds.   Usually paired with midriff-baring shirtsâ€”even tops that aren't cropped can't cover the exposed expanse of abdominal fleshâ€”the jeans have redefined our collective understanding of cleavage. Then there's the oft-visible G-string that, like a bra strap, creates strange fleshy bulges as it strains against the body. But there are worse bulges yet. These are the love handles that materialize on even the thinnest womenâ€”models and anorexics exceptedâ€”because the jeans hit a woman's body at its fleshiest point, below the hips, just above the buttocks. Of course, the feminist in me wants to applaud the insouciance with which women of all shapes now flaunt their imperfections, but the aesthete in me objects. This is a style that suits only 12-year-olds and celebrities who have the luxury of devoting entire afternoons to sculpting their obliques. For the rest of us, wearing these jeans is like putting our hips and buttocks in some humiliating reality show.   Yet the real problem with extremely low-riding pants is that they're impractical. Sitting is difficult: If you can't find a chair with a closed back, you have to tie a shirt around your waistâ€”always highly attractiveâ€”or risk scandalizing the room. If you drop something, or need to tie your shoe, abandon all hope; bending over with dignity is next to impossible. You must perfect the art of squatting, back straight, head up, as though preparing to curtsy. Low-riders also tend to slide down, requiring the wearer to hitch them up repeatedly. In their way, low-rider jeans bear a creepy similarity to Chinese foot-bindingâ€”they constrict a woman's action, rendering her ornamental. And like foot-binding, the jeans can have deleterious medical consequences. In 2001, the Canadian Medical Association Journal published a  urlLink doctors report  stating that low-rise jeans can cause a condition called meralgia paresthetica, characterized by numbness or tingling in the thighs, by pinching a nerve located at the hip. Left untreated, the numbness can become permanent. Forget the question of style: This is a human rights issue.   So, how did we go so low? In America, the first low-rise jeans, called hip-huggers, became popular during the late '60s, with the ascendance of the hippie counterculture and rock 'n' roll. Icons of rock like Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison helped to popularize the style. In the '70s, the pants went mainstream and became a staple of disco cultureâ€”people danced 'The Hustle' in their Wrangler hip-huggers. In the late '70s and early '80s, waistlines moved higher as the culture, and fashion, grew increasingly conservative. Throughout the '80s and into the '90s, as more women entered the corporate workforce, the high waist continued to reign. Even Madonna, who arguably is responsible for today's exposed abdomens, didn't wear low-rise. In pictures of her from that decade, her hip bones are always covered by the waistband of her pants.   Then, around 1992, Alexander McQueen sent models down the runway in his shockingly low-slung 'Bumsters.' In 1995, Tom Ford's first (and wildly popular) collection for Gucci included his now-famous velvet hip-hugger suit, worn by Madonna, among other celebrities. By the mid-'90s, hip-huggers had infiltrated popular culture: Juliette Lewis wore a red pair in Natural Born Killers and Mark Wahlberg memorably peeled his off in Boogie Nights. But it took Britney, Christina, and Jennifer Lopez to bring the style, riding lower than ever, back into the mainstream over the past five years.    By the time a trend hits malls across America, high fashion is already calling it dÃ©classÃ©. Vogue declared low-rise pants over in May 2002, and that spring Tom Ford himself showed a trouser with a higher waist, wider legs, and dropped crotch. In spring 2003, several other designers showed high-waisted pants for fall. And in August 2003, Sarah Jessica Parker, an arbiter of style, told Vogue that she doesn't consider low-rise pants to be age-appropriate for a woman like herself.   It usually takes only a couple of months for a trend to go from the fashion magazines to the streets, and yet somehow, like the G-strings it popularized, this trend clings tenaciously on. It could be that the pants are a feminist statement, demanding as they do an ecumenical embrace of body type by wearer and viewer alike, and as such, women are loathe to abandon them. It could be that the dark fissures and peek-a-boo undies they reveal are physical emblems of our confessional culture, the sartorial equivalent of the tell-all memoir. It could simply be that letting your belly hang free is comfortable. Or that women, buying these pants for lack of choice, have unwittingly created a false sense of demand. But the strongest argument for the persistence of the trend might simply be that we want to dress like the '70s because we feel like we're starring in a reprise of that decade: Our economy is bad; we're entrenched in an occupation abroad; we mistrust our government at home.  I'm not advocating that we abandon this style in favor of Katharine Hepburn-type trousers belted just below the rib cage. As a fashionable friend recently said, low-slung trousers, with their rock 'n' roll connotations, simply look 'groovier.' But moderately low-rise pants can be worn with style and class. There's a famous photograph of Jackie Kennedy Onassis, taken by the celebrity photographer Ron Galella in the early '70s. In it, Jackie walks along a Manhattan street, holding only her keys. The wind musses her hair, and she looks over her shoulder at the camera. Perhaps surprisingly, she is wearing hip-huggers with a slim-fitting ribbed knit sweater. Not surprisingly, she bares no midriff. And a G-string is nowhere in sight.           ",0

Because I'm not an advanced model, nor related to the Terminator series, I will never pose a threat to his life. Or to yours!  Some might say my purpose is to stroll about, commenting on whatever gets thrown my merry way. Some might say my purpose is as yet unknown. Some might say... well, they could say anything. Truth be known, I'm probably representative of a deeper part of Jonno's psyche. It prompts a quote from an awesome movie.  'Is Jonno my bad dream? Or was I his?'

My good friend, Steve, just lost his closest friend Keith.  Keith was in a car accident about a week ago and suffered severe internal injuries, and unfortunately he couldn't make it.  I'm so incredibly worried about Steve because I know he has problems with depression, and I know he doesn't deal with it well.  Something like this could very well be a bigger blow than anything in his whole life... I hope he realizes I'm here and that I will be there for him... I don't know what I'd do if I lost a friend like that, and I hope Steve doesn't do anything that'll have me face that situation...  [[UPDATE]] Yeah, so I guess there was a HUGE misunderstanding, because Keith is fine... just hung out with him like two weeks after all of this.  Umm... I'm confused... but yes, Keith is fine, and Steve is too.         ",0

For how tired I am because of it, they could have at least won!! Now Monday will be another late night to watch game 7. And don't tell me that I'm not being forced to watch the game. I realize this is a choice I'm making, but sue me for doing something that I enjoy instead of sitting around doing puzzles and building towers all day. Yet I watch one hockey game and am lethargic and cranky for two days becuase I'm too exhausted.   And on an even more stupid note : I don't start work until 10:30. I could (should!) be sleeping in, but someone still has to wake up at 5h30 or 6h every day. Is there any way to change a two year old's sleeping habits?

"2139","15365","indUnk","       Here's what the doctor says I have -  ACUTE BRONCHITIS  Bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes, or bronchi (the air passages that extend from the windpipe into the lungs). The inflammation may be caused by a virus, bacteria, smoking or the inhalation of chemical pollutants or dust. When the cells of the bronchial-lining tissue are irritated beyond a certain point, the tiny hairs (cilia) within them, which normally trap and eliminate pollutants, stop functioning. Consequently, the air passages become clogged by debris and irritation increases. In response, a heavy secretion of mucus develops, which causes the characteristic cough of bronchitis. Acute bronchitis usually lasts about 10 days. Severe cases may also cause general malaise and chest pain.            ",0

Intellectual talk, such splendid perfection of minds, ugh, to hear people thinking again! I just needed to sober up enough so I could follow the damn conversation better.  They'd be off discussing economies and cultural attitudes and then I'd hear Johnny Cash and start listening to that, then pick up on the table behind us talking about our conversation, then swing back in to some other point, which I couldn't quite follow or didn't seem to have a point, and then did it all over again.    I'll also let you know now, no alchohol for a week for me. 4 heavy drinks on an empty stomach, and the worse I got was a hangover this morning.  Fantastic buzz last night, but I think I'm craving a bit. So got to bust up the pathways in my brain before they're reinforced anymore.  Show sold out, people turned away again. Saturday night, crazy night always.  Sounds like a system's coming into line for the waitlist too. Good.

"2146","1516660","Student","       Heya! I am back from Choir Camp! Oh my meow! So meowingly fun, and tiring! Lemme start from yesterday.   Wednesday   What a rainy rainy rainy day! It was big and heavy! Yes! I even have to ask Father to bring me there! Of course, I also ferried CQ. Gloria was in school le. Hmm.  The first activity of the camp is practising the songs. We were practising until 4+. Wow! Gerald Ng is a good sectional leader! He really makes sure you know your work..even at particular notes. Okay, as I was saying before we got distracted, the lights were tripped and we decided to go out to play games.  YaY! Group D, mah group, won most of the games!! YAY!! Gerald Law was quick in the Dog & Biscuits game. HaHa! His number keep getting called.   Soon, it was time to bath. Wah lao...the bathing/changing room was totally pitch black, save for the remaining sunlight filtering in! I quickly bathed la(wah!!! cold cold cold water!) and waited for CQ.   Yeah..after that we went for dinner. Dinner was quite disgusting. Eeee. Okay..after that, we went to practise our song for TalentTime. O.O!   After that, we had Treasure Hunt. HaHa! It was over and done with in 30+ minutes. HaHa! We were really rushing like mad! We still lost in the end though. Sigh!   Well, we gathered in the canteen to tell ghosts stories. Ayioh..so scary one. That David ar! We know he was going to scare us by BOOing or something...but we still got scared. Heh Heh. Gullible fools. Soon, Groups A and C went for Night Walk. O.O! B and D stayed and played games to pass the time.  Right. It was time to tour the school. For convienence sake, I shall not post all the stories la. I just bascically looked down at the floor throughout the tour. Yeah.   After the tour, we went to eat supper. I ate Tom Yam noodles and milo! HaHa! We went back to MPR3..after we mass went to the toilet.   Today   Yes! Today! HaHa! Wah lao..we all stayed up real late to discuss/practise songs. Miss Toh and Miss Lim slept with us. Anyhoo...groups started to sleep la. Our group were rehearsing with Dorothy, cause she joined our group for TalentTime. We sang and sang..till 2.30.  We all slept on the sleeping bag provided by CQ! How nice! The five of us were sleeping in a star formation (everyone was saying it looked so nice!). It wasn't a nice sleep. I woke up constantly throughout the sleep. Once Gloria was outside..I accompanied her until she went over to talk to a group of people. I then went back to sleep. I kept waking throughout. I finally got woken up by Dorothy's watch alarm at 6.45. Wah lao..feel so groggy and tired.   We did morning PT. So tiring! After that, we went for breakfast, where I stupidly poured hot water into the lemon tea...and Dorothy and CQ poured cold water in theirs. Right. After that was more games..and our group cut open the watermelon to eat! How sweet!   Okay..after that was volleyball game. We lost utterly. HaHaHa! Oh well. During on the matches, Dorothy spilt her lips. Oh god...that was terribly painful. She was crying and crying..oh god. That must hurt a lot!   Okay..after the games..we went to eat lunch. Hmm...this time's food was better. Yeah. After that, we practised our song!! Dionne came over and helped. HaHa! Right...  Okay. The TalentTime for us was a big flop. We did lousily. Terribly lousily. Dun wanna talk about it. Rehearsals were much better. Yep.   After TalentTime was the prize presentation. Wee! Group D got 2nd group placing overall! YaY!!   AFter that, we went back. So tiring!! I went back, bathed, came online and chatted with JiaHao..then went to eat dinner. Watched TV, came online and chatted with a few of me friends. Here I am blogging. I am damn tired. I fell asleep while watching Sun Wu Kong just now. Sigh. Didn't get to see Sandy's ordeal.   Yeah. I gotta get going. Need my precious sleep!!! On the bed!!! See ya next time! TaTa! Night blog!

They were generall okay lor. I found most of them easy. Physics was kinda tricky with SI units and call. But oh well!! I can manage. And oh my meow!!! Mrs Chew is leaving for Evergreen Secondary!! I heard she chose to leave on her own. I wonder if it is because of bad collegeas? OOO!! That means she could be my brother's Chem teacher! I wonder if she's gonna play the 'bonus points' game with them!! If she's gonna be his Chem teacher, I can pass letters to her via my brother! O.o!!!!  Okay....went back, bathed, went online and ate lunch till 1pm. I went o Wendy's to play MahJong. Woah! Hands so itchy to play. Woah! Howver, the game became quite stale after playing for many many rounds. I stopped playing when the controller went bersek and I discarded one of my wanted tiles! Darn! After that, I joined Wendy to sleep in her room. Ha! She slept on the bed, I slept on the mattress on the floor. Ha! Slept till her mom came back, then she went to bath and this and that. We left her house at 3.15.   All of us met at Woodlands Control Station at around 3.30. Our group went up first, while the other is waiting for MeiYing's sister. Me, CQ, WQ sit at one side, while Wendy, Ping, Chun, Amanda and Janet sat the opposite seats. We chatted and talked and mooed and meowed. Heh. We alrighted at Marina Bay, then took a bus 400 to the restuarant.   Woah! We were there VERY early! Woah! We were joined by Hann later on. After some minutes of waiting around, we went into the restuarant and found that it was open.So, we decided to eat then. Each of us pays $12.   Everyone was like....woah. In a flurry to get things. I was very confused, so I didn't get anything. Hmm... meat was brought back first, so we fried meat to eat. Quite nice actually! They brought back crabs and prawns! Woah! They were really live (No wonder they call the restuarant Zheng Fa Huo Hai Xian (Cheng Fa Live Seafood) )!! Oh god! The prawns are alive and kicking! They struggled when we try to put them into the water!! HaHa!! So cute!   Woah! I find that hor, people don't like a lot of things i like, except for Hann. At my table, WQ and some cats don't like seafood. They took a lot a lot of french fries and chicken wings! Such a waste of money. Only Hann and me like sotong ar, cuttlefish ar, harms ar, vessels ar.... Hann even stole my sotong!!! My beautiful sotong!! Eating steamboat without these hor, is not called eating steamboat. Only cuttlefishes, sotongs, harms and other things complete 'steamboat'! Even the boiled harms are nice to eat! The steam from the stock soup fogged up my glasses. My glasses are so oily!!   After that, me, Hann and CQ went to the arcade to play. Hann played the Para Para! Woah! He's so good at dancing Para Para wor! Moo meow! Ayiah....we flitted here and there, between the arcade and the restuarant. HaHaHa! We started to leave around 8, but in the end, we left at 8.30. Hm...we went to Orchard to see the Chistmas decos.  Woah! So spectacular! Never been to Orchard to see Christmas decos before leh! So cute the decorations! I love the hanging lights! We walked around and saw many buskers! Woah!! They then decided to go to Heeren to take NeoPrints. Woah! Took such a long time! Most of us were rushing back home. But we don't have the heart to tell them that we are going. Nobody does. So we waited like fools. Till Wendy and Clar came running out and we went back home. You shoulda seen WQ. He was madly rushing for the train. I foresaw that he couldn't catch the arriving train. And I was right. Stupid guy. What's the difference between catching a train then and catching a train 4 mins later? Anyway, we went back at, reached home at 11. It was pouring real heavily when I was going home. Oh god!  Okay....today hor, I went to East Coast Park for celebration. The choir is celebrating for us  We took bus 966 there. What a long journey! Then, we had to walk quite a fair bit to get to our shelter. Heh heh. Firstly, some of us went to the beach to play, while some rented bikes and skates. Those who went to the beach are those playing bikes/skates later. Oh...I treated Wendy today. HaHa! She spent about $12 off moi. Heh! Me, CQ were walking on the beach..getting our feet soaked. HaHa. We found stones and threw them into the water. Heh. After a while, we stopped and rest. Me, Ji and his sister went to the shelter to rest and wait for lunch. Then, HF and YJ joined us and we played daidee. After that, we played Cheat. HaHa. I almost ended up being the loser.   For lunch, we ate YiJuia's noodles. woah! So nice! JiJia is really good at cooking wor! After lunch, we went to rent bikes and skates. Me, SL and Joyce rented skates, while CQ, YT and SP rented bikes. Woah! This was my first time on skates! So fun and exciting. We made SP teach us to skate. I mastered it first, then Joyce. SL gave up after bout 50 minutes of trying. We were practising along a fence. I was supporting SL and helping Joyce. I got a cut there from a rusted nail, which made me ultra paranoid about getting tenatus. HaHa! We had difficulty walking up and down ramps. Heh. Joyce and I kept holding on to CQ & YT's bike. HeHe! I had fun skating!   After doing that, we went back to the shelter to play some games. Woah! First game was running and getting sweets from a pile of flour. We were kinda unwilling, but we gave in to their pleads in the end. Our group (Me, CQ, YT, SL and Joyce) won! Yay!! After that leh, we took photos. Then, it started to rain! Heavily! Oh my meow!! Mine and CQ's backs were wet, because our back is facing the direction of where the rain pours in. Oo my! First, we played truth or dare. For this, we played it kinda differently. We held hands, and if we wanted to kill people, we squeeze our partner's hand the number of the people the vicitim is sitting from us. I got Joyce and CQ as partners. When Joyce was murderer, she kept squeezing my hand. HaHa! Once, I was murderer, and I squeezed CQ's and Joyce's hands two times, killing HM and TW. Heh. So fun! After that leh, we played the game Zhong Ji Mi Ma. The loswer has to play Truth Or Dare. Joyce lost during once, but she refused to tell the truth, so she had to do a dare. The dare is to shout from far away: 'I like XC!'. She gave me a murderous stare when I suggested that. Heh heh heh!!   Hmm....we stopped the game after the rain let down. We ate some more food, then went home. We met Wendy and EC after thir bathing, and CQ they all went to change clothes. Me and Joyce took some seashells EC don't want and threw the rest away into the sea. HaHa! So fun!   After changing clothes and throwing away seashells, we went home lor. We took the bus at 5++. The rest stopped at a MRT station, while me and Wendy stayed on the bus till it reaches Woolands. We chatted about a lot of stuff. HeHe.   I reached home at about7.15, bathed and ate dinner (instant noodles). Ayiah. That's all lor. HeHe. Sorry for sounding rushed. I am kinda tired now. So, see ya tomorrow. Night blog!    ",0

Thanks to the apprehensiveness and stress of school, I'm back to me erratic four-hour slumbers. It amazes me that some people can fall asleep by simply lying in there beds. Why was I not blessed with such a gift?  I am such a procrastinator; I have been trying to relay the  urlLink  Coolest Thing Ever    in my blog since I got back from the Radiohead concert on Monday. But the aforementioned stress, apprehensiveness and the added fact that I was freaking out about quitting cross country (now only a minor thing, everyone was cool with it. That is, except Dad. But What can I do? Nothing will ever be good enough, and I am learning to accept that) took up to much room in my consciousness. So here is the story, that is unfairly being told three days late.

I love it. So I told her so in an e-mail, and shamelessly added my link. I guess she was curious, and checked out my blog. She read, like,  the entire thing . If that in itself isn't awesome enough, she wrote this incredible post relative to the whole Certain Unnamed Cult Member breakup. I swear, every word she wrote in that entry was poetry to me, and so exact and so inspiring I can't stand it. I cried and cried and cried when I read it because it was so honest and so true. And painful. And I know exactly, exactly what she means. Only she articulated it better. I really wasn't sure how to describe my hurt until she did it for me.   Usually I selectively quote, using only the most inspired words. But every word in this paragraph is perfect, and I know when you read it you will understand exactly how I feel:  'But your girlfriends are different - they're smart and funny and cool and egg you on to be your wittiest, brightest self. They're there for advice, for hand-holding when you need it, and you pour your heart and darkest secrets into them like they're a sponge, ready to soak you up. You give them your love, wrapped as messily as it is with your insecurities and neurotic behavior and secret love for some crappy band that you'd never tell anybody else about. And all you ask is that they love you back. It's the greatest gift you can give anyone, your love, and in high school it's so intense and pure and loyal and beautiful, this love you give before your emotional walls are fully up to guard you against this exact thing. That why it hurts like FUCK when the recipient abruptly shrugs it off, like it meant nothing. And why you never forget it.'   She continues on about some Certain Unnamed Cult Memeber-esque former friend who ended their friendship. This girl's justification for her actions was completely different from Certain Unnamed Cult Member's and yet totally the same. Oh god, and she makes me feel fucking ridiculous for wanting to be so mean to Certain Unnamed Cult Member. Right now my hurt is still so fresh and so intense that every time I see her, I either want to cry my eyes out or stew in complete and total ANGER. I want to remember every bad thing about her. How she paused a minimum of 20 seconds before answering anything. How we together we solidified our mutual isolation and social anonymity. How all her notes were written in pencil and in oversized childlike handwriting that drove my obsessive compulsive ass crazy. The time she told me her mother thought I was a bad influence. But then I think of how comfortable it was to have a constant friend. Having half of our classes together, I  always  had a 'Study Buddy'.  I  always  had someone to eat with. I  always  had someone to hang out after school with. I  always  had someone to geekily admire Connor Haffety and Stevie Weller  and yes, even somehow attractive teachers, with. And even know that I have people to do all those things with, it doesn't feel as secure. Our friendship had been a comfortable worn-in sweater, and I could always put it on when I felt the need. Now I am a sweaterless mess.   I've really got to get over this. It takes up too much time and energy to be sad. You have got to read it...  urlLink One Good Thing . Affectionately...

This is your host,   Nick  here providing you up to the minute news coverage in the Middle East. Ok, I guess I am not doing that either. Fuck, I'll have to think of something then...  Lets talk about committment. I probably spelled that wrong, but I don't care. Anyway, everywhere I go, I see lack of  COMMITTMENT.  That's right. People are giving up even before they give things a chance. I can probably name a few instances, but I withhold them to myself. Let's just say, some people drop an activity at the slightest change or chance.  Ok, I don't want to be preachy, but give things a frickin' chance! Now, if you do, like let's say, run for 2 years and don't like it afterwards, you can then quit. But, by quitting within the first two weeks, or maybe three, it makes you look like an noncommittal whore. How do I know this? Well, lets say from experience that I was told I was a 'noncommittal boy'. And lets return from irony, because you can almost guess who was saying it! If you don't know, oh well, you will really have to think for yourself.   That is this morning's lesson of the day. Before blogging I was fixing  JR 's mistakes. Sorry  JR , just had to get somethings straightened away! Like, there was a double posting and a word was incomplete and yadda yadda yadda.  Let's get personal now. Ha ha ha. So, who reads this investigative journal? (Ok, I really wouldn't call it that, but too bad). If you do read, send an email to nickbrown2k2@earthlink.net..... Then we will see who is really reading this. Over the months, we are going to try to gain new and more readers of the blog!!! :)  Ok, let me use one of   JR's  quotes, 'Stick a fork in me, I'm done!!!'

"2158","1488330","Non-Profit","           My only suggestion to those who want to 'study' for AP English test is to take as many practice multiple choice questions as possible, and after you took a couple hundred of them you will probably see some patterns emerge; at least that's what I am planning on doing for the next 5 days. The only problem that I see is that all the practice tests written either by Petersons or Barrons are much harder and some of the questions are totally different from those on the actual AP test, so if you take their practice tests you will probably get used to those author's patterns of thinking and the type of questions they ask and what answers they are looking for, yet it's still a good practice: it helps you to try and think like the writer of the questions and also pace yourself. Last year I was taking practice world history tests and so at the AP test all the questions seemed much easier to answer and I answered all of them in time.   I have to agree though with Thomas that AP English is hard becuase of its subjective questions, I am myself almost never 100% sure on answers, and often those that I was sure of end up being wrong. But I agree with Eren also that essays make up for the harsheness of mult. choice; especially after Mrs. VA gave us the rubric it became much clearer to me what exactly I should focus on including in my essays.   So just practice a few more hundred mult. choice questions;), and review grammar and literary terms.  My favorite questions on our last practice test: 26. What is the meaning of the word 'object' (line 85)? a) Feel b) Dispute c) Argue d) Silence e) Save I think Rob was the one to point out the fact that 'dispute' and 'argue' are too similar to see that much of a difference between the two.

"2159","1488330","Non-Profit","           So far I am really enjoying the novel 'Night' due to the way in which the novel is written.  The novel consists of choppy, simple and compound sentences, to enforce the view which he is writing from(a child's) while also creating a fearful, anxious tone in the book that comes from these choppy sentences.  In class, Ms. V-A spoke of the novels 'poetic tone.'  I believe this tone is derived from the sentence structure Wiesel uses in the novel(or atleast the first 15 pages).  Is everyone else seeing this tone? Or something different?  -Pat         ",0
"2160","1488330","Non-Profit","           Just looking back at this year all I can say is that it flew by fast, way too fast to even realize that the junior year is gone... well almost gone. I think senior year will go by even faster, the more you have going on in your life the faster it seems to flow, every day is inundated with just ... life! I just have this analogy in my head: h.s. is like our salmon creek, college is like an Amazon, and after that it's an ocean, and hopefully you get into the warm current;) I am personally looking forward to the end of h.s., I just want to go out into 'real' life and be sort of extricated from the feeling of being trapped in this tiny box, cause life just has so much more volume to it than we can actually see right now. I think college should be awesome, better classes, more people to meet, better professors, just feeling like you are your own person and you can do anything you want with your life. Actually when I was at Stanford our tour guide told us that students there can get as drunk as they want and have as many parties as they want as long as they don't bother anyone and don't get out of the dormitories, I think that's in a way a safer way to drink if you do drink than going out to the woods 'camping.' I missed the accident scene yesterday and the assembly today, but I also would like to think VA for talking to us about this issue today, it just makes it so much more personal and real when you talk about it, and I love it how our teacher actually cares about us.

Yesterday was great, as I am serving together with Pure Joy which gives me satisfaction and rekindle the passion to serve in church as a cell. I am driven by that inner passion to arrange Simply United to serve in the same way ...not just once in a while but to serve consistently. Because faith must come with actions. It was great cause I really learned a lot from Pure Joy...the people with genuine passion with real struggles but equally real desire to please God. Then we had an all guys nite out simply because they are a few girls that turned our offer down..one going to Sydney today and another tired out from work...oh well ..God 's plan.  Then we hanged out in a truly truly awesome place where solitude, silence and serenity with a gentle breeze that blows by just enhanced the moment we share as all guys time...discussing our struggles with BGR...hehehe  But truly I believe that the ultimate love that we hunger for is not just the love of our future spouse..but really to experience more depths in the love of God.

The plane bounced 3 times before settling down on the ground . News later came by Capt Ramlan saying the latest strain of SARS  by WHO and they sprayed the plane with disinfectant everywhere. SIok chye looks suspiciously contagious with his ever sneezes which draws unnecssary attention from the flight attendants.  Went to the University of WA , WOW - it was fanstastic, the weather is 12 degrees celcius and the University College was good, Life here it seems slow paced with fantastic sceneries and street floor so clean u can lick off it....Shops closed on 5.00 pm and the city is closed at 9.00 including the service stores.  I am glad the day before i went and bought a digital camera 3.2 Megapixel with 16 RAM for RM 800 where i bargained non stop with the guy for 20 minutes. Took lots of photos around 60 of them with sun rise on Maltida Bay , the ppl and friends.  On Sunday i went to a church nearby....i met this girl Poh Lee ...who incidentally attending DUMC who is joining SIB soon./ Both of us met up and really had a good time together....hint hint./....  We went to UWA on that Sunday morning...looking for the OCF or the church. On the day i was praying for wisdom to look for the right church as all churches here are mainstream Anglican and Catholic churches. I can't get used to it so i prayed God specifically for Spirit Powered Bible Based Ready to Serve church and lo and behold  The Lord lead us to this nice church planted by the City Christian Church...who incidentally the same mother church produced the  Prophesy Album...it was planted recently in UWA and it is known as the Crawley Christian Church...pastored by Ps Darren ..the youth Pastor...the same church who produced Walk On Water Album,  I praised God for even leading us both to the right church...that day Ps Darren's dad who is the Oral Robertson 's professor gave an AWESOME sermon. He talked about why most churches ordained pastors and send them to the worker's field and not the politician, business man or even students/ He have preached this to many churches as have ordained and annointed businessmen, students, politicians and even beggars with the power of the Holy Spirit and even on the day , lives were changed almost immediately . There was this beggar who came to church looking for food. and Darren's dad prayed for Him prophesying to the beggars the plans of God in his life. The beggar later received food and clothing, and then worked for the church and gain himself an education and now he owned one of the largest business in US giving almost half a million dollars for tithes each month and spreading the gospel like wildfire.  We had a great time praising the Lord and even then the church moves into temporary place every Sunday which happens to be the restaurant byt Maltida Bay.

"2163","1476840","Museums-Libraries","              I'm starting to get nervous.  Have I mentioned that I hate to fly?  'Hate' is a strong word.  'Am terrified to' would be a more accurate way to put it.  My hands are already shaking, and I'm still more than 2 hours from leaving for the airport!  It's not so bad once I'm there - it's like being on a conveyor belt: get to O'Hare, park, take the train to the airport itself, check in, stand in line, shlep luggage all over, stand in line, stand in line, wait, decide whether to buy one more book and an outlandishly-priced bottle of water for the plane, stand in line, stand in a metal tube (claustrophobia, anyone?), get into the plane itself (enhanced claustrophobia, anyone?), find seat (middle of 3-seat side, 19 rows back), get in and turn on the blower full-blast and buckle up right away, and immediately fall asleep.  It's like some kind of airplane-induced narcolepsy, although it's not 'real sleep' because I'm basically aware of what's going on.  But I guess I snore a little.  (How charming.)  I don't mind take-off, and that sense that your internal organs would be 2 rows back if it weren't for the seat cover.  But the ride...turbulence...the view from the plane...yuck.  I'm better off asleep.  I crack my eye when the chick comes around offering beverages, and get some juice.  Then there's landing, when I could just weep with fear.  Well, I could do that the whole time, really.  I keep thinking, 'We're heavier than air.  This cannot happen.  We're going to die.  These people are stupid to not realize it.'  It's a litany of logic (and paranoia, I know).  So we land, and then there's the million-year wait for the doors to open before I can get the hell out of that metal tube, and into the larger metal tube.  And then walk, and then wait, and then get the luggage, and then walk some more.  But then...different!  Find a  taxi!   Take the taxi to the  hotel!   Find some  dinner!   And by that point, it shall be  vacation!   But at this point, I'm still just scared.  I'm also trying to shake off the effects of being really pissed off too early this morning.  I was reading a friend's blog, and someone else was dogging her using her Comments function.  A number of people sprang to her, I was going to say 'rescue' or 'defense' but that's not the right way to put it - the point is that she hadn't done anything inappropriate in the first place, was unfairly targeted, and didn't do anything *remotely* deserving of the attitude that she'd gotten.  So I'd think it must've been at least marginally reassuring to have seen the way her acknowledged friends were vocal in support.  But it's peculiar and disconcerting that someone - particularly someone hiding behind the veil of 'anonymous' comments' - would bother to be so condescending and mean to another person, on that person's blog.  So I kind of snapped.  My response to the situation wasn't as all-purpose supportive as some other peoples', but more of a counter-attack to the cretin who chose to go after her in the first place (in the guise of doing the right thing, of all pathetic maneuvers).  I don't regret having responded, but I do wish I'd waited until I was a bit more awake, because I might've handled it in a less inflammatory way.  That's a sort of vague goal of mine, anyway: to think before I act.  Sometimes things just mean too much to wait on, though.  This isn't how I wanted to leave the blog in my absence, but there's not much time now.  I've got to shower, pack my last-minute stuff, and get to Tara's by 12:15.  That includes getting to the Library to drop off some work that I did last night.  (3 review journals - am I a dedicated employee, or what?

My polling (for a 1990 gubernatorial reelection fight) showed that  McRae  offensive (Bill's ooponent) had dropped Clinton's share vote to a meage 43 percent. Generally, when an incumbent's share of the polls dropped below 50 percent in the polls, it means he is likely to lose ... Clinton's temper got the better of him. Exhausted, worried, and angry, he exploded. 'You got me into this race,' he screamed, 'so you could make some extra money off me. That was the only reason. And now you give me no attention, no attention at all. I'm about to lose this election, this primary, against a nobody' ... Clinton has a terrible temper ... In pain and facing that harsh criticism, I lost my temper too. If he was too hasty in his criticism, I was too sharp in my reply. Storming out of the breakfast room  through the kitchen toward the door outside, I rallied, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've just solved my problem. I'm getting shit from Atwater and shit from Lott for working for you, and now I can solve my problem. Go fuck yourself. I'm quitting your goddamn campaign, and now I am a free agent. I can be a fifty state Republican and don't have to take your shit.'

He's overtired, he hasn't slept well in days. He's not himself. He values you. He needs you,' she repeated.  'I calmed down enough to drive to my hotel, and I called Eileen (his wife) shaking in rage. Later Hillary called to tell me how much Bill wanted me back. Then he came on line to apologize ... I couldn't leave Clinton three weeks before his primary, but from then on I dealt with him in a formal, almost frosty way.

"2171","1474573","Student","                 WOOHOOO! i was watching the game  last nigth as i started to edit some of the footage that i filmed. Lesson 1...ALWAYS STORYBOARD even if it is a documentary 2. Final cut pro is cool but 6 hours go by QUICK. Well every domincan/spanish person in ALL of persons must of been on the 8th floor UCC bulding (all 5 of them) and it was a great time, with only two folks rooting for the redsoxs. Now normally i'm not a huge base ball fan but after catching a glimpse of the Cubs MAJOR fuck up i got interested in the series. I felt bad for them and  i DO believe that they are cursed, you have to be to have fans THAT stupid. Thing is you can always get into a series and surprisingly enough the game last night moved with SUCH high intensity. I kept thinking to myself 'Yanks calm the fuck down' They were swinging at everything that moved and by the 4th innining they were sweating bullets. What i didn't u nderstand though was why Pedro Martinez look so damned shook by the fifth inning..prolly cuz he knows that the yanks are pro's and that they will NOT go quietly in the night. All the redsox had to do was fuck up ONCE and the yanks would take advantage of that and that's what happened. What's his face should have been out but the other whats his face trips over himself and suddenly MAN ON BASE. After that the whole game changed and I said to ALL WHO DOUBTED ME!! that the yanks would win and that they'd turn it around in the 8th and i was right....i didn't expect 11 FUCKING INNINGS! though. I finally had to leave after the bottom of the 9th cuz it was getting really late and my ass was tired and i wanted to go home so i figure i'll find out who one at penn right? I get to penn (which is like 10 m in away) and they're in the 11th inning! i'm like you're kidding me right? All of penn station was empty except for crowding at the two bars down there. (I have issue with that but that's a whole  other blog) so now there are two outs and i'm like SHIT my train is leaving! so i opt for the train.....as soon as it leaves 12:18 someone gets a call on their cell that the yanks won and the who train goes CRAZY!! mind you i hate stupid, italian/beefhead valley stream long island folks but it was nice for a bout a second to be excited about something across race/class and gender.......to be rooting for a team....and now i know why my dad is so into sports........He alway says that outside the sport there's always racist shit going on and such but inside....the drama tends to be more colorblind..it's just about the game. I don't neccessarily agree........but i see what he means.......and that's the last you'll hear of my color commentating....this does NOT mean monday night football on the regular :)  with the outro music d roy p.s.

Starting at age 6, I began training with 82 year old Myrtle Walls aka Mamma Walls, wife of the legendary Daddy LeRoy and his golden spitoon.  Not only was she my mentor, but also my great grandmother, rest her soul.  She was good (a champion hailing from the hills of Virginia), but by the time I was 7, I began kicking her ass in humiliating fashion.  I became so confident, I began playing with just one finger (now known as 'Clarking').  Needless to say, my ability was stunning.  To maximize my talent, she sent me to Bulgaria to match skills with 6 year old communist children.  I became the Eastern Bloc champion and developed a serious smoking addiction.  For more than two years, I ate the communists like one would eat Tic Tacs.  President Reagan said my checkers ability could be a method of conquering communism.  In 1982, I received a medal of honor, but that is as much as I can tell you about my government relations.   After a fling with a Russian hooker that went terribly awry, I decided to give up checkers and focus my attention on the art of monkey training.  At the age of 10, I was saddled with nicotine and vodka addictions and a disorder in which I uncontrollably yelled 'King me, bitch.'.

Even the landline phones were filled to capacity.  No one could contact me from anywhere and I could not even check on the 5 friends that I know worked in at the WTC.  Thank goodness that everyone that I knew personally was OK and escaped.  But alot of others didn't or weren't that lucky.

Press Release calling on Congress to vote NO on CAFTA   **************************** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 28, 2004 Contact: Lesley Ramsey, (512) 507-4185  Coalition calls on Texas Congressional delegation to vote NO on CAFTA  (AUSTIN) Today, as President Bush signs the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in Washington D.C., a statewide coalition of fair trade advocates in Texas is calling on members of Congress to commit now to voting NO on the agreement.  CAFTA is a regional agreement between the U.S. and five Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the negotiations for the terms of which concluded in December 2003. The Dominican Republic was also 'docked' onto the agreement.  First and foremost, we see CAFTA as a referendum on NAFTA, said Lesley Ramsey, director of the Texas Fair Trade Coalition. After 10 years of NAFTA, we know firsthand the devastating effects of this policy on working people everywhere. We will NOT support its expansion.  Second, CAFTA fails to meet any of the baseline requirements for a FAIR trade agreement:        It does NOT include adequate enforcement for violations of internationally recognized labor and environmental standards;        It allows foreign corporations to bring actions against governments that pass labor, public health or environmental laws that reduce corporate profits, as they are allowed to do under NAFTA Chapter 11; and        It includes rules that promote privatization and deregulation of services including education, health care, postal service, construction, transportation and water supply.  Finally, CAFTA is a crucial step toward the even more dangerous Free Trade Area of the Americas--which the Bush administration hopes to finish negotiating this year.  Based on the NAFTA model, CAFTA would push ahead the corporate globalization agenda that has caused a 'race to the bottom' in labor and environmental standards in the U.S. and Central America. CAFTA would also include services provisions promoting the privatization and deregulation of fundamental public services.    In addition, CAFTA would remove all tariff barriers in the five Central American countries on imported agricultural products. This would allow cheaply grown and heavily subsidized U.S. corn and other basic grains to flood local markets (subsidies that almost exclusively benefit giant agribusiness in the U.S.). Small farmers in Central America, already devastated by the importation of cheaply grown agribusiness U.S. grains, years of drought, and the massive fall of coffee prices on the world market, would face the extinction of their livelihoods. CAFTA would likely force a massive migration of erstwhile farmers to large urban areas to work in the informal sector or maquilas (sweatshops), or to risk a dangerous journey to seek work in the U.S.  The Administration's push to implement CAFTA is part of a strategy for an expanded and equally flawed trade agreement, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) which would cover all of North, Central, and South America except Cuba.   The Texas Fair Trade Coalition is a statewide coalition of labor, environmental organizations, family farmers, religious groups and other social justice organizations working together for economic fairness in trade policy.

She's an IT professional working for a Christian company while struggling through her own faith and doubt.   ---------------------------------------------------- My mother left our family when I was very young--3 years old. I shared her name, and for a lot of reasons (including the fact that my father was very perverted), I became my daddy's wife, sexually as well as emotionally.  I was a victim of incest for most of my child and young adulthood ... it went on, even up into my late teens. By my senior year in high school, my father had so convinced me of my disgusting worthlessness, my utter ugliness, and my standing as a total wretch in the eyes of God, I believed that I was lucky to be where I was, to have the 'family' that I did, and that I was completely doomed -- I would never ever escape the tyranny of my father.  (there's much more to this, including my father's rabid public conservatism and evangelicalism which radically conflicted with who he was privately, but I won't get into all of that now)  At the age of 17, I became pregnant. At the time, I blamed the guy I was sleeping with, because I didn't understand fully the consequences of all of what the incest meant, (and I didn't dare think of the other alternative). Through time I have come to accept that it was probably my father's child. The timing wasn't right the other way.  At the time I knew enough about my father to know that if he found out about the 'problem,' he would abort it himself, he was just that way (and he was a frustrated doctor stuck in a lab).   I also knew that I believed in life, that I believed that the child in me was alive and a sacred creation, but I was absolutely terrified. I had no idea what to do or who to go to.  I went to an episcopal priest under the rite of 'confession,' and he, being a staunch pro-life priest, told me that he didn't care if he got fired -- he believed that life was more important than anything, and he would tell my father if I pursued the abortion.  I was stuck. I felt like the baby would die if I did, die if I didn't.  So I went to the east coast (and met my mother, coincidentally), had the abortion there, then spent the next several years wandering around the country, living with people I met, sleeping in bus stations, trying to find some sort of peace with what I had done and who I was.  There's a lot more to this story, but what I want to tell you is this:  I don't think that -anyone- really wants to abort their child. I don't think that they have this murderous desire in them to take a life. It's not like they wake up one day and decide to get pregnant just to have an abortion.  It's that people don't know any better. It's that the people who can help often stand in judgement of them. It's that sometimes conservatives are so busy trying to save babies, they forget about the women who also (even more desperately) need to be saved. The rallying and the vocalism isn't where the change happens. The change happens in quietness--in love and in friendship and in trying to understand.  It's so easy to be loud and male and defiant. Planned Parenthood and other organizations enforce that by their own loud rhetoric (and sometimes, frankly, they have to scream because the opposition doesn't let them have a voice). But there are more lives involved in this then we often know (or want to accept). There are the lives of the women, the girls -- the people struggling with life and death decisions and feeling isolated and alone at this very important moment in their lives.  And there is so much life -- brilliant, fabulous life -- all around us. there is so much more we can do for all of life...  I do not believe in the death penalty. I do not believe in war. I believe in the sanctity of life on all levelsfrom birth to death. I believe in a form of mercy. I believe in a form of grace ...  ... and I've learned that deadness is more than just what happens to an aborted child. It happens to a woman who feels so wearied from her life that she just doesn't care anymore.  I have been that woman. I have been dead and unable to care. And now -- on the other side of apathy, on the other side of death -- I have learned what it means to be truly alive. ----------------------------------------------------  She writes this in a later post:  ---------------------------------------------------- a choice made, but not my choice.  angry voices amplify the grief, explanations given in powerpoint, in heated rallies, pro-life proclamations in half-lit church basements.   requiescat in pace   pictures of the dead on the side of trucks, on sticks held by angry people standing on the corner, 'we will offend you enough to care, shock you out of your complacency.'  look at what you do - look at what you have done  i do not look.  the memories still live in technicolour, still live in my dreams, exposed on the table,  false promises,  the choice i couldn't make but had to. ----------------------------------------------------         ",0

The answer: one hour and ten minutes. But those 70 minutes were a journey into depraved cyberspace that left me feeling nauseated. There you go.  Jan Wong took it upon herself to locate some of child pornography that exists on the internet.  Jan Wong, Globe and Mail columnist, sought out child pornography for a story she was writing.  Remember when Pete Townsend did the same thing?  Remember when Pete Townsend got arrested, got his computer confiscated and said that he was 'doing research' because he was abused as a child?  Remember when he got his name dragged through the mud for what he did?  Can someone tell me why Jan Wong hasn't been arrested yet?  In her column Jan says that it takes an hour and ten minutes for a self-described non-'technologically savvy' person to find some of the most disturbing images that men have ever created: One child stood innocently in a bathtub; others wore black garter belts or thongs that somehow fit their narrow hips. One girl looked as young as 4. Others were probably five or six years old. Some appeared to be about 10, the age when they lose their baby fat. You know Jan...  I've never seen child porn.  I've never wanted to see child porn.  And I've certainly never gone looking specifically for child porn.  But you have. Then a series of photos flashed on the screen that made us sick. It showed men raping little kids, including a little girl who couldn't be older than 4. I hadn't touched the keyboard or the mouse when another set of photos replaced them. They showed a pot-bellied white man, his face hidden, having sex with two scrawny Asian girls, perhaps five or six years old.  In one photo, the little Asian girl appeared to be giving him oral sex. She was standing up, and didn't even come up to his navel. Another photo showed the other little girl, her wrists duct-taped to her ankles, being raped by the man. The expression on her face was vacant. She says that she passed the URLs onto the Toronto police.  She says that this was an 'assignment' that she was given.

"2214","1425932","Publishing","              1. Last night, I watched  Style Wars,  a great documentary on the whole graffiti scene in early 80s NYC, and one thing that struck me was how multicultural the movement was. Because it's so tied to hip-hop culture -- it's one of the original four elements of hip-hop (along with rapping, DJing, and breakdancing) -- you think of graffiti as a predominantly black (or Hispanic) art form. But not only did whites participate in subway bombings, they sometimes, as in the case of  urlLink Min One , joined crews with black kids. I'm especially curious about this historical moment, when these kinds of cross-racial assocations were no longer a big deal, politically, and so cultures had room to clash, merge, and disappear in more interesting ways. For me, Min One stands out as probably the earliest 'wigger' I've seen on film.  2. In Jonathan Lethem's new novel,  The Fortress of Solitude,  Dylan Ebdus, a white kid in mid-1970s Brooklyn, runs around bombing the city with his black friend, Mingus Rude. (Their common tag, 'Dose,' echoes real-life tagger  urlLink Doze .) But by the end of that decade, Dylan's given up graffiti and gotten into punk, into Devo and the Talking Heads. When he becomes a music journalist later in life, it's not rap he's nostalgic for, but the soul and early funk records that Mingus's father recorded. If the birth of graffiti culture can be dated to 1971 (when  urlLink Taki 183  was written about in the  New York Times ), and the birth of rap to 1979 (when the Sugarhill Gang's 'Rapper's Delight' was released), is that window meaningful? (Or is it erased by people like Dylan's friend Arthur Lomb, probably the earliest 'wigger' I've encountered in fiction?)   3. I wish that  urlLink Sasha Frere-Jones  had made good on his  urlLink promise  to write more about the music in  The Fortress of Solitude  -- mostly because I suspect that hip-hop played a more integral role in his childhood than in Lethem's (if we can assume that Dylan is, at least somewhat, a stand-in for the author), and I'd be curious to see how their experiences compare. (Frere-Jones also grew up in Brooklyn and is three years younger than Lethem; this gap doesn't seem that wide, except it's the difference between hearing 'Rapper's Delight' when you're fifteen and treating it like a novelty record, and hearing it when you're twelve and not being able to remember much before it.) I guess there's just something disappointing about the adult Dylan Ebdus turning into a boomer critic like Nick Hornby, romanticizing black music but never anything after 1980. (And disappointing not in a moral sense so much as I just want to read serious fiction that mentions Kurtis Blow!)         ",0

We feel betrayed - this kid was a hard worker but managed to get a hold of some keys to the drop zone and broke in Tuesday night and stole our Playstation II. My husband found the keys in the kid's car and with the help of one of Cullman's Finest, confronted him with it. Turns out he's been using the keys to help himself to the beer fridge, as well. A VCR is missing from the airport's FBO. (fixed base of operations), as well.  What a stupid kid. He had a good thing going - everybody liked him and we paid him well.

I don't think you could ever possibly imagine how many there are these days.  It amazes me how some people can be so damned weird to people they just met.  I suppose that it has something to do with the lack of personal, face to face, conversation.  Almost anyone could be on the other side of that computer and Internet weirdoes dont give a damn.    Take for example my mom was talking to a guy who was getting married and wanted sex advice for his wedding night, and another guy who told her he was into all sorts of weird things.  These were guys she just stumbled upon while playing on Y! games, and started talking to her.  I told her if she was uncomfortable about being hit on by the weird guys on Yahoo that she should only play with other women, you cannot imagine what she said next, Theyre all lesbians, YUCK!    So I have to say that I met my husband on the Internet and I WOULD NOT recommend this to anyone.  Now dont get me wrong, It turned out great and he is a great guy.  Still I must have been out of my mind to meet a guy I met on the Internet!  I realize now that he could have been an ax murderer for all I knew.    My sister met her man on the Internet and when I look at them I realize that I could have gotten a super strange JACKASS like the guy she got, and I cringe!  Her husband is a controlling, drama-queen of a man who will never amount to anything but upstate New York trailer trash.  He and I DO NOT get along and I never intend for that to get any better.  He is an Internet weirdo and she doesnt even realize it.    So in the end, it all amounts to what the person on the other end of the line is willing to put up with.  Remember all you have to do is sign-off.  ~Kristyn           ",0

The INS center I was assigned to go to is about 20 blocks north of where I live, in the neighbourhood I used to live in, Uptown.  The part of Uptown that I lived in, and that the INS center is situated, is not so bad, but some of the area you have to go through is pretty, well.. undesirable.    You first realise that you are entering this area when the boutique-y stores that are along broadway start turning into currency exchanges and pawn shops.  Then, all of those stores have bars across the windows.  Next, the group of people loitering in front of the school with the 'No Loitering' sign.  This is what I was mentally chuckling at today, when I saw a thing I have only seen in movies before.  A drug deal going down.    So, one of said Loiteree's sees his mate across the road, and walks out to meet him.  The Mate walks into the road, and they shake hands and walk away from each other again.  I felt like I was in one of those movies where the cops are watching something on a security video, and they finally spot what they've been looking for, and the camera jumps in three times to magnify what it is they saw - thats what my vision did when I saw a bag of white powder being passed between the two men.

I mean, I have NEVER painted (I'm talking about walls, etc.) and am absolutely scared to death to do so.  My condo has badly needed to be painted since I purchased it over four years ago, but I'm scared!!  Scared?  Yes, scared!!  I am scared that it won't be perfect.  I'm scared that it will take me three weeks to spackle, another three weeks to tape, and then about 3 months to get the paint just right.  UGH!!  BUT ... my brother gave me a bed (long story ... but he gave me the bed from the guest room that they've now turned into the TWINS' bedroom).  I have the bed in my living room right now (contingent on my buying a matress).  Well, I bought the mattress this weekend, and it will be delivered next week (7/29).  Thus ... I figure that it will be a good idea to paint inbetween beds ... I mean to say after I take down one bed, and before they move in the matresses for the other bed.    SO ... I have gotten myself motivated to paint my bedroom.  I actually went to Home Depot this evening and spent about an hour at their computer/paint-idea generator.  Then I took about two dozen cards with paint colors and bought a book about HOW to paint ... and I am now going to shut down my computer and will go and sit in my bedroom reading my painting book and contemplating what color(s) I want to use.

"2249","1335479","Religion","                 The author of  urlLink The Blog From Another Dimension: Crime and Foreigners in Japan refers to being stopped by the police for 'bicycling while foreign.'  For those of you who need this explained (i.e. don't live in Japan) the police here find it perfectly reasonable to stop any foreigner at night who happens to be riding a bicycle.  The problem seems to be that there are people stealing bicycles and of course this is not something that a Japanese person would ever dream of doing!  So it must be the foreigners.  I have actually seen a man (who happened to be Japanese) drive up in front of a train station in the middle of the night and start loading bicycles into the back of a white truck.  It was a lonely place and I doubt that he saw me, and I doubt that the city hauls away bicycles in the middle of the night.    The Bible is full of warnings from God not to mistreat those who are less fortunate.   Deuteronomy 14:29 And the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you, and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are within your gates, may come and eat and be satisfied, that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.'    The similarity between the foreigner, widow, and fatherless is that they do not have anyone to stand up for them -- no larger social context.  So they are easy to take advantage of.  When media and government blame higher crime rates on foreigners they are shamefully taking advantage of a group that has no power to defend itself.            ",0

"2251","1328709","indUnk","             Good morning.  He dumped me, aparently he wasn't ready for a relationship, I sort of guessed that.  I feel so crushed inside, something that could have been so perfect gone completely awry.  This is the most horrible feeling in the world, and on top of that I feel used and worthless...  I'm really starting to hate all gay men I think, there's never an honest, open, compasionate, intelligent and humble guy.  It's so stupid, I finally reached out again only to be knocked down again, is there no trait in me that's desirable?  Or am I a push over?  I don't know, something that should be so simple is the most complicated thing in my life.  I'm crying inside as well as outside and I don't know how to stop it.    We were perfect for each other, both smart University students who have dreams and ambitions in life beyond working at a call center, drugs and alcohol.  Much more than that though, we were both out going, enjoyed the outside, went camping, hiking, swimming, coffee, dinner, movies, all my friends loved him, went out for icecream because I love ice cream, I gave too much of myself again and scared him away.  He told me something along the lines that he never meant this as a serious relationship... what the hell is that?!?  Why should I bother to learn about someone, their family, aspirations, personality and they learn about me if we're only fuck buddies?  This is stupid!  I don't understand!  I'm not sure wether I will hate him or not because I am still processing his words and the whole situation.  Do I do this to relationships?  Is it my fault?  Seems that way, or perhaps I only attract and I'm only attracted to the ones that will hurt me more inside.  I can't handle more breaking inside, I wasn't designed to feel such pain.  I remember him flirting at first, before we went out, we went for dinner at the Calabria and he was so nervous he put sugar on his pizza inside of salt, it was cute.  And my contact decided that it wanted to see how far towards the back of the eye it could make it before causing blindness in shear pain...  so pretty at first, and devastating in the end.  I can totally see the irony in the entire situation, but I still do not apprechiate it.  We used to go for lunch everyday because we both work at the University, now what?  There's going to be a noticable void in my life at that juncture.  It'll give me more time to work on my thesis I suppose.  Here's another song that I wrote last year, it seems to fit here   MOMENTS   Have you ever had your heart stolen in a moment Just to have it crushed in a blink of an eye To finally find that someone who'll be forever Then learn that forever won't fly  And in the moments of silence and teardrops I hold on with all of my might I swear to God one day that I'll be Happy with love in my life  They say true love comes once in a lifetime But what if that moment has passed Because of foolish goals that stand in the way Of something so good for your soul  And when looking back at that moment When we turned down that path of goodbyes Knowing that maybe we really could have been Forever, for always, for life  And what if there's no other moment When we feel this good and so right And what if we now live our lifetimes Wondering if there is more to our lives  Thre are times at night when I'll remember How our hearts touched one moment, one time After years of heartache I'll surrender as the lonely forever, for life  So how could we have been ever so foolish To let something interfere with our hearts Instead of living life by it's moments, we were Blindly living life for it's ride  They say love conquers all, but in an instant You either have nothing or you'll have it all It's what we won't say, what we're holding back As if we've died inside  So as we keep living life in that moment As I reach out through all of my tears Doomed to a lifetime of sadness And aging through all of these years  I wonder if you can remember Our very first walk in the rain The very first time that I kissed you and the moment you whispered my name  I wonder if you would still hold me Like a ship that was lost in the storm Searching desparately for my guidance to a place that was safe and warm  And as I sit here remembering those moments A rainbow breaks out in the sky The sunlight returns from the darkness The tears run new in my eyes   LOL, I can't even see through my tears now :(  I have to go, take care  LOVE and Sadness inside DAN:(         ",0
"2252","1325894","indUnk","       'Nobody likes me. Everybody hates me. Guess I'll go eat worms.'       Once upon a time, in a place not too far from the ocean but very far from here, there was a pond. Murky and small, it lay in the dip of two dirty hills, collecting old rainwater and whatever debris floated down from the nearby city. Swampy weeds turned its bottom into mush, while bacteria coated its surface with thick algae; the scent of rotting wood and stale water hung in the air between the hills. Despite the dark, monotonous sky that hovered overhead, the grasses surrounding the body of water soon shriveled and died, for the ominous clouds never brought rain.   Very few creatures could stand to live in such a polluted environment-- a few toads, many creepy-crawly insects, and a handful of small, bottom-dwelling fish were all that habited the pond and its shores. Scruffy-looking birds, when desperate enough, would sometimes venture near the edges of the water to catch the meager grubs that burrowed along the bank.   However, unbeknownst to the casual passerby, one old fish swam in the shallow end of the pond, his dorsal fin skimming the surface and disturbing the greening water. Small and the color of mud, he had lived out many a year at the dank silt bottom of the pool. In his prime, he had been feisty and lively, taunting the birds by leaping clear out of the water and smacking the water with a loud  splash!  Now in his old age, the mud-brown fish had begun to tire, his scales no longer sleek and his body unable to do much other than sleep; he was content to simply warm himself on the dirty sand and dream.  Dream of open water.  Oh, he had heard stories; the little fish once had a very awkward conversation with an old swallow (the swallow was far too emaciated and close to death to be a threat to his life). The bird had weaved tales of water so big that no creature ever found the other side. Tales of magnanimous proportion, fish the size of trees and birds with gills. Trapped within the confines of his tiny watery prison, the mud-brown fish would often imagine a daring escape and a long swim in the big water that would last the rest of his life.    His friends, grown cynical with age, scoffed at the ridiculousness of the idea. Water expanding until the sun rose from its surface? Even if such a place did exist, they pointed out, how on earth did the mud-brown fish intend on getting to it? Fly?  It was impossible, they said.  And even still, the little old fish dreamed.   He dreamed and dreamed until the sun had set a thousand times and the autumn turned to winter turned to spring. And now, he was a  very  old fish. His eyes were beginning to cloud and he was going blind; his scales had dulled from mud-brown to grey; his muscles, once feathery and strong, had become stringy and limp-- swimming became an exercise. The old fish knew he soon would die...  And he would never have lived anywhere other than this tiny, polluted pond.  But then-- miracles of miracles-- it began to rain. For the first spring in his lifetime, the pond rippled with raindrops pouring from the over-saturated clouds and coming down in sheets, in buckets. It rained and rained and rained for an entire month, quickly filling the little pond until it overflowed and a small stream leaked the access water out to the east.  Birds, frogs, rabbits, even a few deer, all healthy and spirited, ventured near the dirty little pond-- the rain had rejuvinated the land and made it habitable for all sorts of creatures, not just a last desperate resort to dying beasts.  The tiny inlet was a door thrown wide. Many younger, spryer, more adventurous fish left the pond without a second thought, traveling with the weak current to wherever the stream led. The very old fish, once mud-brown, remained in the shallows where he could rest his weary fins on the warm sand.  'Maybe when I were younger,' he thought to himself with a sigh, 'I could have made the journey. But I am an old fish, and soon will die.'  Days passed, and the little fish remained where he lay, feeling miserable and growing older and closer to death. Even though the door to the open water was right in front of him, the very old fish was too weary and ancient to move from his spot.  His friends laughed at him. Grown older themselves, they too were too old to make the journey and were thus left behind.   'Go,' they goaded, 'you wanted so badly to leave that you wasted your life wishing.'  'Maybe if I had wished harder,' the very old fish replied tiredly, 'I could have made the journey. But I am a very old fish, and soon will die.'  To this they laughed. 'If wishes were fishes every bird and snake and toad would be full...'  At this the old fish fell silent and spoke no more for the rest of his life.    The very old fish, once mud-brown now grey and closer to death than he ever thought possible, spent the remainder of his days lingering around the opening to the ever-shrinking inlet; without more continuous rainfall, the stream was drying up. He lazily swam the length of the mouth endlessly, wondering what became of those who had taken it, his body becoming sicker and sicker with age and the inlet becoming smaller and smaller with the day's heat.   The day the pond finally closed to trap the very old fish within, he died. The very old fish had awoken in the morning to find the stream completely gone. He was so heartbroken that he used the last ounce of his thinning strength to thrash around violently, speaking his upset without words or tears. A starving bird, upon seeing the disturbance in the water, quickly took to flight...   ... and in the stillborn hours of the morning, gobbled up the very old, dying fish without hesitation.    The end.                   ",0

"2255","1325355","indUnk","            The State of Things  There is something comforting about stepping outside on these cold mornings. Old Fort Road is blue and dark intermittenetly broken by cones of sickly orange light from street lamps; the horizon is rimmed with wispy veil of clouds and it's quiet. Only one house, the one directly across from ours, has it's porch light on.  I am immediatly reminded of the duplexes that I grew up in. Particularly, i am reminded of the first days of school. It's these days, right after weeks and weeks of warm long mornings and sleeping late, that are the most memorable. I sleepily carried out the trash. I would sling the bag over my shoulders to make it easier to carry. It banged on the backs of my legs as i walked the distance of the driveway towards the sagging decrepid tower of duplex mailboxes, each with their mouth's hanging slightly open (ours never closed right). There, around this leaning tower, the trash was huddled like wrinkled black football players.  It was cold too. Even in my sweater. My mother didn't have the foresight (or the time) to start up the car twenty minutes before we left so it could warm up, so we would sit in the car and wait for the heater to crank up. The exhaust would billow behind the car, and the foggy windows would slowly become transparent. The school was literally right around the block so it wasn't long before i was pulling my sweaer off to keep from sweating in class.  And this is what i think of when i step out in the mornings, as i pull myself into my own car warming it up for our trip into town. One house over, light seeps through the cracks of the garage door; if i listen hard enough i can hear the neighbor loading herself into her SUV. Her door opens and she slides out and waves. I wave back, start up the car, and retreat back into the house.   urlLink            ",0

"2263","1319486","Student","           first of all i would like to say hello to my adoring fans......'HELLO!' well, that's settled....today was great, lazy mixed with working and working out....i thoroughly cleaned my fish tank and room and vacuumed(sp) it and now im dead tired, yesterday i bought the fifth harry potter book (the order of the phoenix) and i finished it today around 9:15 pm, it took just over 24 hours to read it...not bad considering it's 870 pages long.....very very good tho, best one yet, although the pattern is always the same, this is my thoery of the pattern of the harry potter books....okay.....here goes....something strange happens over the summer, and he's never in contact with his friends until they suddenly reunite before the end of the summer for some reason or another, harry and his friends always know more than the other kids about something that's hidden and they usually have to fight the bad guys in the end to get it back, harry and his friends also never get it exactly right so they put themselves in danger when they really could've avoided it if they just informed the adults of what they were going to do....but of course they don't because they think they have it all figured out, harry can never do it on his own, dobby or hermione or some unlikely character always gives him help in the end when he least expects it and he ends up fighting a very bad guy, who is one of he-who-must-not-be-named's favorite servants who is doing a good job until they fail or die or something, then harry sees he-who-must-not-be-named and they talk and his scar hurts, then dumbledore or someone sent by him comes and saves harry and one of his friends is injured and harry is knocked unconscious and then he doesnt want to talk to anyone at the end of the year feast and he feels no one understands him at the end of every year, at the end of the year, dumbledore explains everything that harry was too dumb to figure out or ask and then he goes home and looks forward to coming back to hogwarts and hates the dursleys once again...THE END. that is the end of my theory...pretty good, huh? yeah, i thought so...well, im taking a break i'll be back in a sec....

"2268","1316855","Arts","       Ok, well, as I worked today I now have my weekly fix of gossip mags. I'm happy to report that Kimberley Stewart made another appearance in Who, Kimberley may also be spottedon the 'Shrine to Kimberley' (or 'Collage of the ugliest people in the world') on Noni's porch. This time she's embracing the fam, daddy Rod and other hideous siblings.  But what I'd really like to make note of, is the whole Jen and Ben saga which was in every one of the 7 publications I read this morning. To tell the truth, I really can't make any sense of it, it appears the articles are mainly about the prenups and Jen's control freak hatred of Matt Damon. Anyway what's really funny about the whole thing is the amount of made-up quotes for filler; here's my fav from New Idea:  ''Ben saw it as a mountain out of a molehill situation but it became a very big deal.' the source (!) says 'He was pleading  'Baby, you know I love you' , but nothing seemed to placate her. J Lo blasted him for taking a potshot at her mum Guadalupe' Where the hell do they get these 'sources'?! Anyways, thanks for the suggestions Furzikins, although I don't think the 'suggestion' of Ryan Adams is reeeeeallly necessary, as he will take up most of the Cds anyway, just random songs that I'll try and fit to match the city.

"2269","1316855","Arts","       Shayne they were excellent questions, deserving of a well thought out response. So well done Erin and here's my trollop 5 cents worth.  1) Bucket really is a good name, full of humour and pathos (one night at tropfest and now I'm using words like these). But if I changed my name to Bucket tomorrow, the fact that noone has ever known me has bucket would have wide-ranging implications. Like the fact that people trying to find me would now have to look up 'Bucket' in the phone book. And I'd have to ask the 8 or so stand-up comedians in my office to seriously refer to me as 'Bucket'. And I've developed a strange attachment to my sir name, what with my proud family war history and all, so giving that up is going to be emotionally tough. Then again, I'm going overseas so i need some cash. 'Bucket' it is for $2000 in a paper bag.  2) Time travel to any significant event in history? It would have to be either a) the assasination of julius ceasar, b) the fall of Robespierre and the french revolution or c) Hendrix at Woodstock   3) 5 CD's to take back to the birthplace of civilisation - 1) Gustav Holst - The Planets Suites - 2) Led Zeppelin IV - 3) Louis Armstrong - Greatest Hits - 4) The Beatles - Rubber Soul - 5)  Electric 6 - Fire  4) TV show resurrection? I want new 'Goodies' episodes and the return of the 'A' team.  5) Being invisible would be awesome! That'd be a busy week... Monday - Go to white house and spend day in oval office observing the world's most powerful and incompetent man at the peak of his powers. Release potentially criminal findings to the world media in niave hope that US citizens will wake up to themselves. Tuesday - Playboy mansion Wednesday - Streak through Manchester United - Arsenal game in front of 39,000 people. Realise that doing this invisble isn't quite as gutsy. Thursday - Spend the day randomly kicking Millsy in the balls. Friday - Sneak on a flight to Perth, plant large quantities of gay porn in basil zemplis's news desk, make anonymous call to Channel 7 Perth management. Sit back with 6 pack of Little Creatures and watch Perth's sleaziest b-grade celebrity try to convince the public he's straight Saturday - Spend the day perving on the female members of Hi-5 Sunday - Take a steamer on John Howards desk minutes before a meeting with foriegn dignitarys  That about covers it.

"2271","1310522","Communications-Media","        urlLink Blender magazine  has come out with its list of  urlLink The 50 Worst Songs Ever . I was mildly amused to find that one-tenth of these songs falls under the subcategory of Songs That I Either Paid Good Money For Or Recorded Off The Radio In Junior High, And Which I Probably Still Have On Cassette If You Feel Like Driving Around In My Car And Bumping Them:   'I'm Too Sexy'  by Right Said Fred (No. 49)  'Hangin' Tough'  by New Kids on the Block (No. 46)   'I Want to Sex You Up'  by Color Me Badd (No. 41)   'Rico Suave'  by Gerardo (No. 37)   'Ice Ice Baby'  by Vanilla Ice (No. 5)  Maybe this is just nostalgia talking, but I really don't see anything wrong with those songs, unless being irresistably catchy to the 13-year-old ear is wrong. And I don't think it is.  There are a number of other songs on the list I could subcategorize as well. For example ...   'Make Em Say Uhh!'  by Master P (No. 36)  Song That My Sister Paid Good Money For Just A Couple Of Years Ago, Which I Recorded On A Cassette And Still Listen To Regularly In My Car That Does Not Have A CD Player Because I Am Not Cool   'Mesmerize'  by Ja Rule feat. Ashanti,  (No. 45)  Song That, In Spite Of The Corny Video Where They Rip Off 'Grease,' I Actually Really Like But Would Never Admit It ... Whoops   'Greatest Love of All'  by Whitney Houston (No. 30)  Song Whose Lyrics I Successfully Used In An Article For The  urlLink Mustang Daily  But I'm Not Sure Anyone Noticed   Not to mention several Songs From The Mid-'80s That I Don't Remember Paying Any Attention To At The Time They Were Released But Whose Lyrics And Or Tune Inexplicably Started Running Through My Head When I Read The Titles, including  'Broken Wings'  by Mr. Mister (No. 19), and  'The Final Countdown'  by Europe (No. 27)  I'm kinda perplexed about the absence of Richard Marx songs on the list.

"2272","1306027","Student","              Prom is.... tomorrow.  And I seriously could not be more stressed than I am at this moment. I mean, keeping secrets is hard to do when you want to vent on stress, but- just so you get an idea the stress is like:  Driving off a cliff knowing that the edge is coming up and you can't turn the wheel.  Was that a good enough description? Not that I mind all the work this prom has taken to get off the ground, it's just I'm 16, and, life only gets more stressful from here. A break? Ha! This is real life we are talking about....   Of Course, you out there telling yourself that I should lighten up  I'd love to do that! Why don't you give me a way to lighten up and I'd be happy too. Right now just, let me vent and shutup. You don't have to listen. In fact- why are you still here reading this?    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Ok, I'm better. Paper bags tend to help a lot. Remember that. Anyways on with my ranting....    Nails.  Why do we have them anyways? They suck! Well, not literaly. Let me offer up some suggestions as to what they are commonly used for these days.  1.  An Alternative Food Source.   2.  10 Deadly Weapons   3.  A Useful Pick   4.  A Handy Wedge  And that's only a few. Whenever you are born nobody sticks a tape recording to your ear that repeats 'Do Not Chew Your Freaking Nails, Moron' endlessly. Why? Well, for one it might be degrading. And two- that would be a mirror of the book  Brave New World , which I will not summarize simply because it can't be.    So what's the big deal?  Why do people have to have their nails 6 inches long and looking like a chrome plate? I mean, they are not only a national threat but they distract you with their shiny-ness as well. I, on the other hand, have .02 inch long nails and they would'nt crack a peel on a banana. (Crack- a peel? Yea weird analogy...just live with it.)    Besides my nails...  I..I... have nothing else to complain about really. I mean I could get into gruesome detail on everything but, I think I will spare the 2 solid readers that I have. Love you guys!

"2285","1283349","Student","            [Witty, yet meaningful title, with delightfully geeky tinge]  On iTunes: Black Heart, by Calexico  My condolences for the Fill In Your Own Goddamn Title of tonight's post. You see, all my synapses are engaged in pondering the deeper meaning of...    THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS    That's right folks, it's time for the Dice Squirrel to review the last in the 'Woah...' trilogy.  Once again, on opening night (this night) I saw the Matrix. Upon getting the tickets, I did some sort of a jig. I'm not sure.  We'll start from the start, and go from there. Bear with me folks, I'm still not altogether here, most of me is still thinking furiously. I'm pretty sure the opening had something to do with the really intense I'm Out of the Matrix, and Really Intense About It people. Hovercraft, tunnels, shots of various vaguely ethnic-looking people, along with a few dyke-y females. Very strange sequence (probably because I'm still halucinating from all the strobing gunfire of the last half of the movie) , all in all, but at least it had some purpose to it, which is more than I can say about most of Reloaded.  Then there was something about trains, Indian people, and hobos. I believe there was a chase scene stuck in there somewhere. Then the old actress of the Oracle dies and they make up some really shitty plot devices to explain the not at all similar replacement black lady (though she still looks like she could advertise for Real Home Cooking Maple Syrup.)  I'm losing the really hysterical (at the time I thought of them) bits of the blog, so I'll summarize the plot very quickly: Neo walks around, looking like he's higher than a cat's back; the Council of Zion and the People of Zion act out a few scenes straight out of some Star Trek thing somewhere sometime; there's a very long (and fucking badass, I should add) fight scene between humanity and machinity.  Right, on to my making fun of several parts of the movie.  I was the only person in the sold out theater who broke out laughing when all hell was breaking loose in Zion. It's one of those things where the camera focuses on a nobody soldier, who's saying something like, 'Sweet baby Jesu--' while another random soldier gets thrown across the screen, screaming. If I had a nickel for every time they used that damn scream sound bit...  Also, the movie actually uses a cliche it has created. Normally, that's not cool. Here, it's not cool. I don't know what they were thinking. Trinity does her little Jump Up Into the Air, Pause, Spin 360, Unpause, Kick the Guy In the Face thing. Again.   Also also, the machine city looks very similar to every other Evil City. Spiky towers, dark clouds, lightning, flying nasties, and a Head Honcho with a really deep, loud, resonating voice. Though the big floating Head Honcho of Revolutions is quite nifty, I must admit.  All in all, I loved the movie. It'll take a few more viewings and a few more days for me to realize the scenes I really adore, but I'm pretty sure they all have something to do with Kicking Ass.

"2314","1241488","Publishing","                 hi   here's a bit of history for my current bandmates and for those who care about candyaudioline.   candy's first bassist was a girl from up named obie. she happened to be one of my closest friend at that time ('97). by early '98 she was replaced by bing who was recommended by romel of sonnet 58. not much of a pretty face but she was definitely a real bassist unlike obie who was more of magazine pin-up figure than a band material.   by middle of '98, bing quit the band after candy's first 'in the raw' appearance. (she later admitted that she was only after radio exposure) she was later replaced by then 15 year-old beejay who at that time had no idea on how to play the bass but got admitted into the band for three reasons: one - she owns one of the most visually attractive and ultra-light bass guitar with one of the coolest brand  names (megabass) ever, two - this girl is very pretty and ooozzing with sex appeal and three - yours truly had a very big crush on one of her friends. she had a short stint as candy-bassist because she was to migrate to the states. this signalled the return of obie who at that time , really improved on her skills. first as a sessionist bassist then decided to join in as things were beginning to shape up for the band. that didn't last long because after 3 months, she decided to quit the band (along with our original vocalist) to concentrate with her studies. beejay was taken back in because her magration was still up in the air and she didn't enrolled that school year. a month later obie returned along with cheng. beejay and then new candy vocalist apol got booted out. not wanting to get separated from beejay and specially apple, yours truly decided to form another band which eventually became soft pillow kisses. that was '99. candy (and pillow) never had line-up problems from that time until early 2000 when obie decided again to leave the band for good due to commitment problems. lara was introduced to me by a friend but before that me and beejay already saw lara playing guitars for then up and coming YUCKPOP quintet _________. she played bass for candy for about a year or so before quitting the band for reasons beyond the grasp of human comprehension.  beejay sessioned once in while until yours truly met ayn through irc chat. admittedly we thought that getting ayn was a mistake because aside from her being drunk 25 hours out of a 24 hour day. she was then very slow in learning some of the songs (one of the reasons why joey quit the band). i stuck out with her anyway because aside from the free rides she offers, her attitude towards the band was really heart warming. she was all-out for candy. well it paid off, 5 months into candy ayn was really letting lose. contributing not only in money and transpo but also putting in her own bass lines at that... at present, she's still there and hopefully will be there until the time that we decide to end candyaudioline and focus on our being EATFREAKS... HEHEHE.   by the way, during the latter part of ayn's pregnancy, we got the services of sonia. she played three gigs for candy two as bassist and one as singer. she now sing for a ska band whose name i can't recall...  ayus bah?

Then she dropped me off and it was like 1 and then I was talking to Fifer and then I went over there to hang with her and Abby in the after hours and wow I had so much fun, it was just unbelievable...I would put some of our jokes, but then people might think that I was like obsessed with sex, or completely stupid or something, and we all know that I am nothing of the sort!

I won't tell you all what I asked because I still have a little dignity. Needless to say the answer was no and not again.  I feel a little weird about it because I don't even know what I wanted the answer to be.   I think it is time to move on in my life, and I will because it is about time. Moving on is hard to do. Maybe when I get done with all this crap that I am going through I may just go out and try to go buck wild if my health allows me to.  I may just become the next Tucker Max...only of Pittsburgh. I would need do a lot to do that...but I think I may be able to do it. After all what do I have to live long for...certainly not love.  Which brings me to this idea...Love is a farse, something created by man. An emotion that is flawed in every sense of the word. To unconditionally love someone is impossible because we are all capable of stopping that love is certain conditions are met.  So for me I will no longer love as I cannot achieve that emotion. Instead I will lust.         ",0

"2325","122217","indUnk","       Do you think that, months or years later, I'll look back on all of this and know what it was all about? I like to think that I will because I've always liked the idea of summing things up. Part of the fun of experiencing anything is being able to wrap it up in a nice little package. Explanation clear and simple. That's what it was. That was what the deal was with  that . This is what was learned. This is what happens next.  I made a decision about a month ago that some things couldn't be wrapped up that easily. So there are some things that I'm stuffing into a box and throwing away. It's a big mess and a bunch of stuff is sticking out the sides. I could save the box of stuff to go through it later. But I can't. It's too painful. And I'm not certain that it's worth digging through the debris trying to make some sense of it-- even though I tried doing it-- off and on-- for several months here. Generally, you only do that if you want to learn something from the experience and I think my big mistake was not realizing I've already learned some of the most important lessons of the last two years. If you learn and don't make any changes, that's the real tragedy.  I'm wandering into a darkness... a darkness from which I don't want to emerge.   I don't believe one should try to control one's end. But I'll sure give everyone plenty to talk about.         ",0

"2327","1198592","Accounting","            Love Hurts   To the point of death apparently.  Recently, I had found out that a certain blogger, unable to withstand the realization that his (ex)fiancee could not return his affections, killed himself.  His suicide note was posted in his blog in the form of a letter to his significant other.  Obviously, blogs are terrible in revealing details and I can only assume what's left in between the lines.  But the blog in itself was an irrevocable testament to a life lived - and ended. Posts on his tag board were heartbreaking - friends cursing him to say anything - any thing at all to disclaim the truth that he's dead; people wishing that he rest in peace; directions to his wake.  Links on his blog include a link to a picture gallery of him and his girlfriend.  His previous post to the suicide letter were news about his then, upcoming wedding - he was going to be married on June 5 this year.  Where does love end and obsession begin?  How do you walk the tight-rope of promising to love someone forever, knowing that either he/she and you may change, subtly or abruptly, in middle of that journey?  And most of all, how do you go on if something you worked so hard for, ends, because life is fickle?  I can feel a deep sympathy for the woman who now has to live with the fact that she, no matter how indirectly, contributed to such loss of hope in a man, that he killed himself.  And while logically, the choice was made by someone who had a right to how he wished to live and end his life, logic tends to be a poor bed-fellow in whose arms solace has no place.  As for the blogger, may he rest in peace.  If the internet had ghosts, he might be a likely addition to them.  I still pray not, however. May he be free.         ",0

Yesterday I convoyed with the reunion of original Bukit Beruang `kedai makcik singgit lima posen' homeys to the nuptial ceremony of Mahjongs brother.I realized on my way over to her obsessively green residence (and I mean green awnings,green gates,green windows-the works) that I am not the least bit close to Mahjong nor have I attended any of her lavish open houses and other special occasions she had so valiantly invited me to.And for a while there I felt a little embarrassed that I am about to turn up at a house of an influential politician without a proper gift and wearing a raggedy baju kurung with iron burn marks.  Actually,none of that had mattered.  The `extravagant affair turned out to be a funfair/joget lambak/SUKMA/ethnic karaoke competition that inspired most of us especially Bovril to learn and sing the Buaian language. A warm, fuzzy wedding so beautifully done, kampong style with additional speed fans to ease our  mentekedarah  rounds.Now thaaaaaaaaaats the way, baby.  I didnt think I would have made it because initially I was busy with some freelance work. Yes, yes, I know I have sworn not to commit to such sacrilege again;but I am a sucker for men in dark blue denim and a crisp, fitting shirts. My  veryvirit  buddy Tong made me go to his office a few days before, using a printed copy of my text brochure as bait. I was only curious to know how it looked like, the useless last-minute secondary school English I had penned for a Muzium guide a few months ago.I went to see Tong's boss for my feeble payment; only to meet probably the most attractive, suave, charming yet  hideous  man I have ever seen in my entire life. The minute Tong introduced me to him I immediately said yes to the 120 page annual report translation job,to anything and everything that has to do with this delightfully revolting man with a wonderfully superb dress sense.  Then on Saturday while everybody else was out getting outfits for the Sepang rave, or watching the latest movies, or getting extravagant woven cloth for baju Raya, or boozing their brains out watching the World Cup at Hartamas Square; I was at home sweating the 40 degree-weather spread eagled on the bed with a notebook on my lap cursing myself and Cute Ugly Man for my unlikely weekend misery.  So thank you Mahjong, the very calming green aura of canopies,costumes and flowers; my lovely friends and the inexpensive Jawa/Mandailing/Minang/Madura band for cheering me right up.          ",0

Although my intentions were to have Friday off, I however did not plan to be off yesterday.   I was BURNT to a crisp, I kid you not.  I went to the beach this past Sunday and came home with a 'Lobster Face'  burnt ALL over my face and I could not feel anything but my skin sizziling, and my lips were swollen, needless to say I could not move yesterday....So here I am today, back, feeling a ting better, yet still burning, but really how many sick days can you take off for being stupid and not reapplying sunscreen after you went swimming.....I swear I was so scared I was going to have skin cancer....I was so read, I was so scared and I wish I would have done something about the burning sun, like cover up a bit better.........the only good thing out of this:  I will have a kick ass tan by weeks end.....my face is itchy...  Other than that my weekend was pretty lame....I went shopping and bought  urlLink  boardshorts    from ROXY, then I hung out all afternoon and then chilled saturday night so that I could wake-up early to go to the beach...nothing exciting, nothing new.  How was your weekend??  And now the belated  urlLink  Friday Five:     1. Is your hair naturally curly, wavy, or straight? Long or short?   naturally wavy, and short   2. How has your hair changed over your lifetime?   I went from long, dark brown  hair with bangs ( I was 5) to really short choppy light brown hair with blonde highlights   3. How do your normally wear your hair?   messy/crazy   4. If you could change your hair this minute, what would it look like?   blonde, short in the back with long choppy layers over my face.  I really wish I was could have blonde hair.    5. Ever had a hair disaster? What happened?   I don't think it was ever a disater, well this one time my hair was cut one side longer than the other, I cried for about 5 minutes, then my friend came over and fixed it for me............good times good times....

"2333","1166708","Arts","                   'Where do you see yourself in 5 years?'     This is a question that has plauged me for many years now.  Showing up in random converstaions in bars, in interviews and also in the public bathroom stall in the lobby of the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel.  I hate this question.  When asked, my brain completely shuts down, I freeze up and I am left standing there with a dumb founded look on my face, a look that seems to appear more often then needed or welcomed.  It is a question that makes me look deep down inside my soul and see that all I am thinking about that is soulful is the question that always pops in my head,  'Are they ever gonna make a lactose free ice cream that doesn't contain traces of nuts?' , and nothing else.  I can be here at work and dig deep into my soul to find that same answer, even in interviews and especially in the Hilton hotel public washroom.  It will never change.  My mind cannot comprehend such vast soul searching questions.  I have never soul searched for any reason.  I am not even sure if I have a soul left, if I remember correctly I think I sold it somewhere between Las Vegas and Arizona for a few more minutes of sleep, and I don't think I ever got it back.  Nonetheless, soul or no soul, I have never been able to answer this question.  In the bars I tell them,  'Look dude, if you think my future includes you, forget about it now and just walk away while you still have your dignity.'   To the man in the stall next to me in the Hilton hotel, I told him,  'Dude, your wearing a dress, but you gotta dick, there is no cocaine in the woman's bathroom.'   And to all the woman and men who have interviewed me over the last 7 years I have said this,  'For me there is no 'plan'.  I don't know where I will be in the next 5 years.  I hope I have a job then and I hope that I am happy, but my life long moto, since the day I took my first breath has been, live for today and not tomorrow.  I will forever believe this.  I am a free spirt and no one can hold me back.'   Today, I still believe that and I know it will be a stong belief that I will pass on to my children.  Now I ask, where do you see yourself in 5 years?                    ",0
"2334","1164965","Student","           I too fondly remember a time when I could fit both legs into a single pantleg of my size 30 waist JNCOs in the 4th grade.  I also remember the furious discussions with my father after covering them in grass stains playing football at recess.  It is an era I will forever remember with a twinge of longing in my heart.  I believe the same will be true once I exit high school.  In the elementary years all my friends and I could think about was reaching middle school, and now I wish I had savored those moments.  Understanding this time conundrum, I refuse to make the same mistakes twice.  Not even in the most boring, drawn out day of high school will I ever say â€œMan, I wish I was in college,â€ because I know Iâ€™ll blink my eyes and be a forty year old man sitting in a recliner in my underwear with a beer on the table and a hand in my drawls as an homage to Al Bundy.

"2336","1162265","Student","       Okay.  Good last few days up until one of the Twins peed on me today.  Saturday my mother hosted the staff-parish relations meeting at our house. So we had a BBQ!! That was amazingly (suprisingly?) fun.  Cousins from Dover, and there kids also came over, they really complain to much, but whatever, this is the first time in a long time that they've been over.  So that day went well, infact once I'm done writting I'm going to get some left over steak.  Yummm......    So yesterday, we got to see the Cousins from Washington, w00t.  They'd come in Saturday, but we gave them that day to settle into NYC.  Lucky them, because the Make-a-Wish Foundation put them up in the Hilton in Times Square!  I can only think of two Hotels that are better and that'd be the Marriot and the Plaza (and the Plaza is to Bougie...).  So we saw them, walked around a bit, and finally settled on this one tiny resturant around 50th Street and 7th Ave.  It was pretty nice eating there, got to catch up with the Cousins.  Then we walked back to the Hotel, passing by Times Square and having my dad point at certain sites.  Like eighteen guys approached Scott trying to sell him stuff.  I liked the guy who walked by him casually and asked if he wanted a bag of Hip-Hop and R&B CD's.  So we got back to the Hotel eventually, and bid them good day until Tuesday (Sarah is going to St. Barnabus for some treatment).  So we walked across the street to the Coldstone Creamery, to see what this place is all about (they're opening one in SO).  It was pretty good stuff, but they treat Ice Cream like an art there, and it's very formal (I guess that'd be a good word).           ",0

BERENICE - Sure but bums don't fall in love, they just get horny.   CABELEIRA - C'mon, you cut everything I say to pieces. BERENICE - Bums don't talk, they just vomit words. CABELEIRA - Jesus, I'm gonna stop wasting my saliva on you, you sure ain't easy. BERENICE - Bums never stop, they just take a break. CABELEIRA - Jeez Berenice, talking about love with you is pretty complicated, isn't it? BERENICE - Love, you gotta be kidding. You're just leading me on.  CABELEIRA - But it's just that this jerk here loves you.  It was funny because this was a reccuring theme in the movie.    Seriously.  It's playing in Maplewood, you need to see it.         ",0

Just hung out with my drums. Saturday from 8:30 to 3:50 I had NYSSMA, working and then my solo at 3:45 and then at night I went to my cousins for my cousin's birthday. We had some fun. Went to the park, played some softball, played with Katie's ferrets, Dan threw toads at the park and at night we watched Disney's sing along tapes I haven't seen since I was like 5. And we watched Blair Witch Project. That movie sucks. I'm pissed after seeing  urlLink this  and  urlLink this .  urlLink This  was good though. I'm just sick of the retarded war. It's completely pointless. And if there's a draft I'll spit on the people who think they can bark orders at me. What am I fighting for? Religion, to prove a point? What because of 911? BIG FUCKING DEAL. So two towers fall down...that happens everyday in the middle-east. And you can thank the government for making Al-Queda do that to us. And the military goes in to justify, 'TO MAKE THEIR COUNTRY A BETTER PLACE' That's not the real reason why. The reason is pure revenge, don't give in to Bush's bullshit. Give me a fucking break. Things were better when Saddam was there. People and buildings weren't getting blown up everyday until we came. We're making things worse, and of course the military and govt doesn't care, they want it because of sweet revenge. So to prove a point that we're the most powerful? To represent the bald eage? The stars and stripes? George Washington? Big deal. Nationalism can suck my dick. Why can't we just live normal and stop fighting each other for power. Why can't this world live where every country is happy and equal and there doesn't have to be military. War is pointless and alot of you morons have too much of a primitive brain like the government to figure out that war is completely POINTLESS AND RETARDED! We're fighting over nothing. Ah, there isn't gonna be a draft, I mean look at the force we put against the Iraqi people in those websites. It's horrible. There will be a time in the future where kids will learn the US to be the evil empire in their textbooks. Horrible, just horrible. Drafts are the most crazy thing ever. WHAT RIGHT DOES A GROUP OF MEN, OH IM SO SORRY I FORGOT YOUR THE GOVERNMENT! YOU MUST BE THE NEXT THING TO GOD. MORONS. THE GOVERNMENT IS FILLED WITH PEOPLE, NORMAL PEOPLE JUST LIKE US. You have freedom. A right to stand against the government. Don't let the government do what they did in our past wars. Don't let them destroy our society's emotions by taking away our loved ones and ruining families. War doesn't hurt us, but it hurts Iraqi families over there also, I used to not care but after seeing these pictures it makes me think, these people are people just like us. We're killing them all, the kids, the women, the men. This world seems to be falling apart yet it has always been like this. There will never be peace on earth. Unless...machines, they're perfect.

"2346","1149422","Publishing","       San Diego, Day 2  Sheryl dropped us out at the airport so I could pick up my rental car yesterday afternoon.  We took a shuttle to the Alamo location, where we waited in a huge line for at least 40 minutes.  This particular Alamo location was crowded, filthy dirty, and had multiple broken auto-check-in kiosks. I did not like the look of the place, and it didn't get any better the longer I stayed there.  I chose Alamo because I've rented from them before in LA and San Francisco, and because they have a policy allowing the use of debit cards for renting cars, which means I can use my PayPal card.  I like using the PayPal card because I can consolidate my money from other credit cards or from debit cards onto it, instantly. It's got the MasterCard logo on it, but I can also use it to draw out cash, like any other debit card.  Except this particular Alamo rental location insisted that they could not accept my PayPal card.  They didn't even try to run it, they just saw the PayPal logo on the front and they refused it.  The manager backed up this craziness.  He told me that it 'wasn't a major credit card' (despite the MasterCard logo on it) and ALSO refused to accept it as a debit card, even though there was a clear debit card acceptance policy posted on the wall behind him.  I said, 'Even if you won't accept it as a credit card, you have a posted debit card policy.  This card works like a debit card!'  'Ah,' he says, 'works LIKE a debit card.  Works LIKE a debit card.  It's not actually a debit card!'  It was like we'd stepped into bizarro world.  I told him that I'd rented cars from Alamo with this very card, recently, in California even.  He just looked at me and said that whoever had accepted my card should have been fired.  I was open-mouthed in disbelief.  I suggested that he inform someone at their corporate headquarters that they should update the policy on their website, since I had a standing reservation that said nothing about not accepting certain cards from certain issuing companies.  We then reached an impasse.  I had purposefully moved all my money and available credit for this trip onto the PayPal card.  I had no other cards, debit or credit, to offer them!  Chris was with me, and Chris had money on two different cards, but then we ran afoul of another of their bizarro rules: the name on the credit card and the name of the driver have to match.  Since Chris does not drive (lived in NYC, took the subway everywhere, has never learned to drive) they still would not rent us a car where I would be the driver and Chris would pay.  The clerk called the neighboring rental car location: Airport Rent-A-Car, and they came to pick us up. While I waited, I called PayPal on my cell phone and asked what was up with the card not being accepted.  They were as shocked as I was, had never heard of such a thing before.  The woman said, 'Surely it wasn't a manager that said this.'  Oh but it was! She was amazed and assured me that my PayPal card is a 'real' card and should be accepted as a credit card for any transactions.  She gave me a number to call if I ran into any further difficulties, and confirmed with me that there is plenty of available money on that card. I sense a steaming mad complaint letter in Alamo's future.  Back at the ranch, we were dropped off at the neighboring rental place and there I saw a couple other people who had been waiting in line at Alamo. This place was shady. Oh, did they mention their computers were 'down' and they had to do everything by hand?  While I was there waiting for the girl to finish my transaction, the phone rang twice with people calling in to complain about their rentals ('I paid cash last night and you charged me way more than I thought it was going to cost!').  It was like one of those check-cashing locations, or those places that give loans to kids with bad credit for 30% interest, but I didn't have another option at that point. I got in the car and got out of there as fast as I could.    Once we got away from Shady Rental Cars, I started to enjoy San Diego almost immediately.  We drove up to Balboa Park, but by this time it was after 4:00pm and I wasn't sure what hours things were open.  We stopped for a small snack, since everyone was starving, and then decided to take a drive out to Coronado Island.  We also drove down the Silver Strand, then back up again.  We stopped at the beach and let Kate run off some energy.  She begged to play more, but I was starving.  We walked over to the Hotel del Coronado, which was very cool.  Decided against eating at their fancy restaurant on the theory that Kate wouldn't like anything.  She's not nearly the fan of raw oysters that Chris is.  We ended up at a nearby seafood place instead, which was perfectly fine (and mixed a tasty margarita).  Since there was still a little light out, we drove back into the city and up to Old Town, where we scoped out the location of Chris's book signing on Saturday and kept Kate entertained by walking around the various shops and historic buildings until it was dark and time to call it a night.  Today is Seaworld.  Tomorrow Rick and Hal arrive for ComicCon, as well as our convention display.  We have a few hours to get set up and then they've got a preview event happening tomorrow night. That's when the real work begins.          ",0

"2374","1107146","Student","       Still depressed eh...  You know...the best advice I ever got while being depressed came from that self-help book. I don't know if this applies at all, or if you're willing to accept it, because I have no idea about this situation, but the majority of the book deals with being able to accept the fact that we can't change people, only that we can accept ourselves. And I don't know why, but the more I thought about it, the more sense it made until depression isn't really hard to deal with anymore. Well it depends on the dosage, and the time of day and how drunk I am. But whatever, I'd bet that book would help out a lot, if you'd like.  I was up until 4 this morning playing Snake 2 on my dad's cell and staring absently at the ceiling, listening to the storm outside, and beforehand, a series of booms that definitely weren't thunder because they kept answering each other, but sounding like it still. And of course, nobody else heard them. They weren't on the news. Fireworks, maybe? Those were some fireworks, just cuz of how fast they were going off. And considering that yesterday was...July 29 WOOT, what a festive day....  I was awake because I had become just physically addicted enough to NyQuil to become a tad impaired in the sleep department. And then I had to wake up at six to take my da to work. So blah, tons of morning [sic]ness. But I got over that fast enough, and we drove down Woodland Avenue to his office; I've never been that way before, but there's some awesome stuff on Woodland Ave. Like, awesome shops and stuff. It's awesome. So I'm hoping to get the car tomorrow and go check it out.    Casablanca  is SUCH a badass movie...but the ending! It sucks! RAGH! It's a freaking oldie, there's supposed to be only good endings on those suckers. WAAAAAAAAHHHH. That was me crying for the end of said movie. Dude, Humphrey Bogart is such a pimp. As stated on Linds's BLog, I am going to become him from now on. It is thus that you will see me about school walking around in Italian leisure wear, drinking lots of bourbon and smoking expensive cigarettes, and generally being a badass...and Abby's going to hate me, heheheh. But perhaps the suave charm of my being Humphrey will help her ignore the kinky haircut and alchoholic drool smell that follows me everywhere, and the poss and whatnot. Ok, I can't do it, so what. God knows I'm not charming. Nor can I afford a constant supply of bourbon and cigs, or be able to pay off all the teachers to allow me to intake such pleasures in their classrooms.   Well, I can always dream...  And kids, guess what...only two weeks 'til school starts. YIPPEE! I'm excited. Not really. My drum teacher had Mrs. Bayrd when he was in BHS...when I said I was taking AP US History, he asked the teacher...I didn't remember, he looks at me and says 'Bayrd?'...I nodded, he gave me the 'Shall I get the shells or do you have some in your pocket' look. So I'm excited, once again. Apparently he walked right the hell out of her classroom because he didn't like her. Hell yah JD. And that's what I'm probably going to do because, bygod, I intend to not work as much as possible this year and get by. Even tho I brought all this on my self. I don't care anymore, at all. I have lost every will to be better than anyone at anything, to stand out academically, to be renowned as smart.  I've lost it. And it feels wonderful.  I mean sure, I'll still go about respecting basic school rules and stuff. But past that, I don't care. Homework can go suck an egg. So can this dumb essay for that matter.   Wow, I'm going to fail, that's great.  Well...heheheh. There's a bit of work in store, I have a feeling that I'll be doing better this year, coming in with a lot less on my mind as last year. But I intend not to stress, and I encourage all of you to follow suit. Altho that's entirely wasted on Rosie but Lord knows I've tried.  Going to play some CS and clock out. Bon voyage, kids!

"2379","1103084","Education","        blog genres   i've been teaching a lot about genre this year -- my unit on genre in Persuasion has coincided or at least overlapped iwth my unit on genre in MASS MEDIA AND SOCIETY --   (hey!, my loyal readership insists, this is the *BACK* burner.  you can't talk about the content of your classes on here...yeah, yeah, i know, but...  i've been more and more interested in the diversity of emerging genres in the blogging universe.   Kelly blogs about  urlLink the RANT  not as a genre of blog discourse -- but of everyday discourse -- but i do think that ranting is a pretty normative genre in this medium.   the other genre i've been keenly interested in recently is the hello? genre.  My brother Daniel included this tag at the end of a recent post:   'BTW: It's really wierd to post ideas without having people read them. I'm always writing a letter or a newsletter page, or updating the web site, or participating in a forum, or sending out an e-mial to my church. In all of these situations lots of people read the stuff (or at least pretend to).   It's wierd, but I like it. Even the fact that I'm writing about my feelings on this has a stench of wierdness.   Ok.. It looks like for one paragraph there I entered into the world of blogging. Don't expect more of that.   (That last statement has the unwritten submect of 'You'---Who is You??--That's what I mean about wierd?) '  Or my brother David, before he had Stanley, the fan, wrote:   'hey, if you are not my brother or in my youth group and you read this, would you mind emailing me at bishoprudd at yahoo.com?'  and after several days of nothing:   'by the way, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE???!!!??  oh yes, i know you're reading this. see that little black box to the left...no, higher up...no, the one with numbers...yeah, that one. that tells me how many people are hitting this site. and it doesn't count every time i come here! so WHO ARE YOU!!!  not that i care, as i've said before, i am here simply for you!'  in my first experiment with blogging, I wrote a  urlLink 'who are you & what am i doing here?' entry , and Marcaus wrote me an email about it -- which i posted to the invisible (and pretty much nonexistent at that time) audience....  Yesterday I read a blog which qualified in the 'hello?' genre, but seemed so lonely, and needy and pathetic, that I couldn't bring myself to post it publicly.   I wonder if all blogs go through a state of ambivalence about their identy / role / audience?   Maybe I'll start a blog that collects links to instances of the genre.   YEAH!

"2380","1103084","Education","       well it seems like blogging has, for me (temporarily?) gone the way of the ... well, whatever the extinct thing was that went at the end of that colloquialism.  Hmmm.  It seems like as technologies emerge, I love to jump on the bandwagon around the end of the  urlLink early adopters phase  -- and then it either does or doesn't integrate well with my life.  I'd like to dream that each time they integrate well that they improve the process -- facilitate the flow, but I'm too fond of  urlLink McLuhan  to be quite that naive.  But like McLuhan, i'm also optimistic.  Someday when this technological optimism link is blue -- that'll mean that I've devoted a back burner or two to these thoughts about how technology colonizes our imagination and how it might free it...  So here's the dream.  That all the people I love decide to blog, too.  That we all.  together. (simultaneously - of course - while I'm on a wishlist) decide. to *be community* via the web.    Maybe the most ongoing disappointment of my life (and don't worry I'm not disappearing into a funk -- I got a good sleep and plenty of caffiene today) is the fact that my dearest friends and the people that most inspire me / love me / enrich me.  Are mostly far away from me.  Globalization! [andrew spits].   [andrew regrets using such a visceral gesture since it translated so thin-ly onscreen and made such a mess on his already disgusting office carpet.]  When my friend Kelly went out to LA to study Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I set up a blog for her to tell us about her experiences in LA without feeling like she was writing rambling descriptions and depositing them in our inbox unsolicited.    i thought it worked out beautifully.    i read her exploits religiously -- but whenever i wanted.  sometimes i responded; mostly I didn't.    the blog seemed as redemptive a technology for the negative massification effects of web technology as was the voicemail / answering machine to redeem the telephone (connection over intrusion in both cases)  Martin Buber writes Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Å“all real living is meetingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½  - if the blog lets us MEET, then isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t it a life-giving force?    Since this is sorta a 'metablog' anyway -- I do have to admit that one of the rich discoveries of this year's vacation was that the notion of BACK BURNER is an important one to keep me whole.  I journaled a whole entry (in my private journal, Lynn, just to reassure that even people 'like that' (like me) who want to 'write in journals and then publish them on the web!') on what exactly a back - burner is, what ends it might serve, and how it may (or may not) move forward onto front-er burners...  But that'll have to be on another back burner!  My heart is with Mary right now who, as far as I know, is IN LABOR having a *baby*!  Tell me that's not crazy.  To have the disembodied knowledge that one of your dearest friends is BEARING A LIFE right now...  I started filling in random links over there on the right.  But these have no referents nor categorization, but should at least enlighten and entertain...!  Peace~    ",0

"2401","1091544","indUnk","            Working from home  I've been working from home all week and the workload is light so I've been trying to get through some of the bigger projects that have been on my plate.  I was certain that I could get the Marketing Plan put together for 2004, file my expense report after reconfiguring my laptop, and then back up all my data.  What really happened is quite different.  Yes, I kept up with the emails and voice mails while working to keep a few projects on track... but just like when I'm 'in the office' other things popped up... like trying to get my son potty trained, keep the house clean (or close to it) and keep the kids busy.  In a model of efficiency, I decided to go with the carrot and stick approach to potty training.  Alex gets as much candy as he can eat each day until he has an accident.  Then he gets none.  This plan worked out great for the first couple of days then he had an accident and I had to cut him off... this is tough stuff.  He knows the rule and even recited it 'no accidents for candy' while pushing another Reeses peanut butter cup towards me.  Not only did I have to tell him no, I had to clean up the mess.  Overall, the plan is successful.  He has eaten about 4 pounds of candy per day, but he's only had one accident... he sleeps regularly, and his poop is OK... there are the bouts of mania that make me think of crack addicts, but all-in-all nothing that concerns me too much.  The big question is what will happen next - I'm going to run out of candy and he is not going to run out of piss.  I need to get an end game to this deal before the last lollypop stick hits the trash can.           ",0

"2415","1079521","indUnk","       Well, today was more of the same. As the week goes on, we are all getting anstier and antsier. (is that a real word?)  But, one good thing: we had a 2.5 hour lunch break today. They built in an extra hour for the medical administration training just in case, and we didn't need it.  We really didn't even need all we had before noon.. but oh well.  So, I got to go eat lunch with my mom & Peggy at Mayberry's.  Mmm. Hot fudge sundae, YUM! And, I still had time to walk the doggies in the nasty humidity.  Then, we had 2 hours of 'Household Management' where we learned how to order food, supplies, etc for the cabins. (We have to cook meals for/with the kids) and about health regulations, stuff like that. Oooh fun!  At least this woman didn't read us word for word all the stuff.  She was like 'I trust that you can read and figure this out, it's not rocket science'.  YAY.  But, it still took 2 hours.  Tomorrow and Friday are de-escalation and something else training.  I sure hope it's enough to fill 2 days.  Maybe we'll get lucky and have a half day on Friday. =)   It was so freakin' hot and humid when I got home at 5, that after I took the dogs for a walk, we got in the car and are now at Mom's.  Just got out of the pool and now I might go back in!  I took Melly in too.  (she's been in before, but this time she swam most of the length of the pool).  I almost had her jump in on the first step, but Kirby (the doxie behind us) started barking and she went running off to see what was going on.

"2430","106651","indUnk","              SOME 3650 DAYS LATER   So last week,  urlLink Mac  e-mailed me with a web page category question, and the conversation eventually came to the topic of our ten year reunion.  In just about three months, the graduating class of  urlLink Libertyville High School ,  urlLink class of 1996 , will be getting some form of strange invite from some small faction of our class that has been eagerly anticipating this day since we got our diplomas. What's even sadder perhaps is the fact that I can picture some of them, still donning their LHS orange and black cheerleading outfits, huddled around a table going, 'Eew, do we have to invite him/her/them?'  Am I alone in thinking that ten year reunions aren't what they used to be? I'm sure that back in the day, people had reunions because they didn't have the extensive abilities to communicate with each other like we do today. They had the long lost art of the post office. I'm sure in the 40's and 50's, I would have lost contact with Kyle or  urlLink Bruen  or  urlLink Jeff . But now they're just an e-mail away so I don't need a reunion to catch up with them. The entire nature of the reunion has changed. It ends up being one of those 'life reminders' like weddings* and babies*, where you sit back and mumble, 'Jesus, I'm getting old.'  Now it seems like the reunions are almost there as a comparison of status. 'What have you done in ten years?' I know my personal story isn't that great and sometimes I'm pretty embarrassed by it. I should have been doing better things by now, but that's a whole different rant. Regardless, there's always that feeling of underachievement that will bind itself to the ten year reunion with me. And maybe it isn't so much that I dislike comparing myself to other classmates, than it is realizing that I'm way off my path. Ugh.  Anyway, for the same reasons I loathe seeing people I graduated with in public, I loathe the idea of going to the ten year reunion. The fact that we have to replay the last ten years of our lives over and over and over and over and over. I mean 99% of the people that I graduated with, I haven't kept in touch with...for a reason (does anyone really know where Phil Erisman went?). If I haven't talked to you in ten years, what makes you think I want to talk to you now? I can hear  urlLink Kyle  giving me his 'burning bridges' speech again after this. What's the appeal in trying to talk to people that I barely had anything in common with for four years, and then trying to do it again ten years later?  It kind makes me think of prom. People getting together, listening to the trendy music of the time. You know we're going to listen to endless Pearl Jam tracks sprinkled with the one hit wonders of the day. Everyone probably dressed real nice to impress the others and then within an hour, all those little high school 'cliques' come back and people separate. But I never went to prom.  I told Mac that the chances of me attending the ten year were pretty slim, and if we were to go, we'd be going in a certain  urlLink style  and I would most likely be packing 'heat.' My bundle of friends seem undecided right now, but I'm pretty sure most of us will have reasons not to go. I guess I still have three years to make myself feel worthy of attending the reunion so don't cross me off the list just yet.  [ Talking to his psychiatrist about his high school reunion .]   Marty:  They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do.

"2436","1057539","Telecommunications","             I was so freaking stressed out today over finding Chris's state-certified birth certificate so that we could get our passports.  And in the back of my mind, I thought I would be OK and there wasn't really a reason to worry this much, but I couldn't stop myself from stressing out.  Anyway, long story short, I got home & found his birth certificate in the place I put all of my important papers.  Who would've thought to look in the very place it should have been in the first place?  Go figure.  I think I may get a chance to go see a Broadway show sometime soon.

My great aunt gave me her car. Its not cool at all, its a 1992 chevrolet caprice, but its free, and the insurance is like only $100 dollars, and there's nothing really wrong with it. So im not complaining, and my parents say if i can take care of it, and keep a job, 'they'll see what they can do' about a new car. So yea, its pretty cool. Im trying to make the car as stupid as possible, complete with fuzzy dice, beads, maybe some fringe, maybe some of those beaded seat covers. I dont know, stuff like that. And ive named it Remy Lebeau, because its burgundy colored, it has the fuzzy dice, and because its just a cool name. Anyways, its a pretty cool thing, but yea, the car isnt cool at all. It has a V8, which is nice, but other than that, wow. Hmmm, i really want a different car, but this one is free, and it might lead to a new awesome car down the road.

"2444","1031806","Technology","                 I actually had a pretty good weekend. It was busy (thankfully) and passed pretty quickly.  Lets see... on Friday I worked until my usual 4:30ish time, and then I came home. Sarah called me around 7 from camp which was cool because I was missin her a bit (hehe). Nothing much else happened today, which was ok.  Saturday... today was a really busy day that never actually ended. My morning was pretty dull... just hanging around the house cleaning up my room (it's still a mess, but I can see the floor!). Later in the Evening I went to my Aunt's and ate chinese food with the folks... Mmmm, I love Fried Rice. We came home at just the right time, because not 10 minutes after I sat down I heard my name from outside, and Peter was there. So he came over and we talked for a bit and played with computer stuff, and then he had to go catch his bus home... which he missed... and it was the last bus out. So we decided he'd spend the night (with permission, of course). Well around 2 we started getting bored, and then I noticed good ole Carinsdev on AIM. So we IM'd Armaan and it ended up he picked us up and we hung out all over.  We went to this cool construction zone and explored and had interesting exploits with spray paint, cones,  and wireless network cards. Then breakfast at McDonalds.... Mmm good times. I got home around 7:30 and went to sleep while Peter did stuff. Then we went to Church and dropped Peter off at a bus stop so he could head home.  After Church my mom went to her friends house and I went with her and saw The Butterfly Effect. It's a very weird and twisted movie, but actually pretty good... though I wouldn't suggest seeing it if you're depressed. After the movie I went to Becky's house and hung out for a while. They're so funny... they made some (really real looking!) dummies and stuck them in their neighbors living room... amoung other things. Over there I watched The Secret Window... which is a really creepy movie. I actually kinda liked it though... because I've always kinda wished the 'bad guy' didn't get caught for once, and it happened.  I rode the bus home because I didn't want to wait for my mom to be done at her friends, and I found out that Sarah's bus broke down in the middle of nowhere on the way home... though as I woke up this morning I discovered she'd gotten home and told me she was safe, so that's a relief.  Now here I am at work... listening to The All-American Rejects and not really having much to do. I can't wait until payday.... I need to figure out what to get someone for a 6 month aniversary....             ",0

It was only like 70 out, and some crazy people jumped into the pool anyway... the spa I understand, but not the pool.  Afterward, while I was driving home on TV highway, west of 170th, I saw a photo-radar vehicle on the side of the road and immediately checked my speed... under 55, so I didn't slow down. When I passed it though, the thing flashed and when I got home I checked with my mom and apparently that section of road's 45, not 55. Gayness... whatever, so I guess I have my first ticket...

We had some fun making very loud booms with Uncle Greg [Gadaholt]'s spud cannon, but eventually put it away in fear of the wrath of the neighbors. :)  I then came back home and started working on backed up homework that I had from before Christmas break, and that's what I'm still doing right now.

Arm swings looking much better.thou like i said before, more room for improvements still. Wet weather actually caused much disruptions for the trainings at first.Luckily, we got there just as it downpoured. Esp things like moving from the SIS to the Nat'l Stadium were in a mess. But also good thing that it rained, the casualty rate dropped a lot.Praise the Lord. The cadets were really excitied and their morale were pretty high. maybe it's because they had western dinner by SFI and lotsa of ice cream. the instructors too were enjoying themselves, enjoying the full run from the galleries.  Hiccups occurred in the training but no fingerpointing were to be involved . All of us are always learning new things,even me.

"2461","1011289","indUnk","             I wasn't going to write about this.   I woke up on the17th with a bruise sort of pain. On my ass. I had no idea how a bruise would get on my ass, and in such a place on my ass, but i did recall that years ago, i had crashed a bike pretty damn good, and this was a similar pain, so i thought 'yeah, this is a bruise. '  I haven't ridden a bike in three years. So, the orgins of said bruise were wrapped in mystery Still, it was a bruise. On my ass. In between my cheeks. Right-o.  Days later. The pain, instead of going away has intensified to a whining scream. Weird, thought I, but since it's in such a funny place, it only stands to reason that the bruise wouldn't heal so good- there's perpetual pressure going on there.  On the 29th, i just about beat the poop out of my dog. For barking. Peculiar, since this is  something that dogs do, and i do encourage Lucas to be a watch dog. He was doing his guard dog job, and i thought about killing him (just for a second) to shut him up. The pain now has become absolutely excruciating, and nothing could relieve it. I had three scalding baths that day. I also blacked out a couple times.  Woke up the morning, of the 30th, and it was a countdown to 5pm, when the walk-in clinic opened. Walking in presented a problem. It took hours, and went sort of like this: Shuffle shuffle. 'Lord, please strike me dead.' Shuffle shuffle. 'The last thing i want to do today is show a doctor my arse. It's a bruise. i'm overreacting.' Shuffle shuffle. 'I don't need to show these good people my ass.' Shuffle shuffle. 'I wonder, if i hitchhike, will someone pick me up?' Shuffle shuffle. 'Owowowowowowow.' Shuffle shuffle.  I get to the clinic. The receptionist does her receptionist thing, and asks 'And what is the reason for your visit?' I lean over, and whisper. 'I have a horrible pain in my bum.' She blinks a few times. 'I'm sorry? Could you say that again?' 'I have a Bad Pain in my Bum' 'Uh, you mean, down there?' 'Yes,' I hiss. 'All right, please take a seat. Er...'  I was stunned by the speed of nonwaiting. I had come in behind a few people, and yet i had the dubious honor of being first to be called in. The nurse chatted me up, looked at my bum, andfussed over me a bit. 'You walked HERE? You weren't taking anything at all for the pain? Bless your heart.'  The doctor came in almost right away, and he looked at my bum. He  poufed , and came back with another doctor's name on a percription slip. Told me i had to go a town over to the hospital, and it wasn't in my best interests to wait. I had an abcess on my tender rear, and it had to be drained immediately. The doctor on the slip would fix me.  I phoned pizzamomma from the waiting room phone to ask her to come get me from the clinic and take me to Emergency. Worried, she asked me what was wrong. Embarassment hit again. (Waiting room with a few people in it. Was not going to mention to the room that i had something amounting to a HUGE pimple on my butt.) and i said not to worry, and that i'd tell her once she came and got me.  My doctor was Thai, with a Very Efficient manner, but quite friendly nonetheless. The nurses were not of the soul-sucking bitch variety i had encountered  countless time in C-City. They were nice, and they clucked their sympathy.  Eat fiber, folks. You do not want this happening to you. They taped my buttcheeks open. How's THAT for vulnerabilty...? The doctor applied local anasthetic, and i still ended up passing out from the pain. He let me know that this is something that becomes easier to get after the first time, and that i had to change my diet, and address my weight. 'And,' he added, 'The next time it will be an operation, and we'll have to put you to sleep.' Gahh.  All in all, it was an entirely unpleasant, embarassing and a horribly  bodily  experience. But, it was definitely funny. For instance, it was pizzamomma's birthday. At one point i moaned to her that this was no way to spend a birthday, but she told me that now she'll always remember her 25th.  They sent me home with a perscription for pennicilin, gauze between my buttcheeks, a list of things to buy from the pharmacy, and a new hole in my ass the size and shape of a cap of toothpaste. Standing up felt like a song - it didn't hurt any more!  Well, it hurt some. But not in comparison to previously.  Unfortunately, around11pm, the local anasthetic wore off. And that's where i'm at now - hobbling about in pain. In my ass.          ",0
"2462","1009572","indUnk","        Running 'Up' in Forest Park   There is a 6 mile loop (it's actually about 5.7 miles) at Forest Park in St. Louis.  The St. Louis Triathlon Club runs there every Wednesday at 5:30pm, and as a member, I try to get out to run with them.  One way around the park goes up a long hill parallel to Skinker Ave., and the other way goes down.  I run with the club a month ago and went 'down' in 1:06 and some seconds (5.70mi).  I figure that I paced myself pretty good that time, I went through the first mile really fast, and that had been my longest run of the year.  Yesterday, we ran 'up', and it turns out the distance up is 5.72, but then again, you are running on the outside lane, so that's the difference.  1:04:08!  Good pacing, strong running, and the uphill was only about a minute and a half slower than the overall pace of the run, so that's great.  I'm sure my down time will improve significantly my next time out.  I feel strong and fast at the end of my 4-6 miles runs now, which means the long runs are doing what they are supposed to do.  My asthma is still holding me back during the second and third mile, but I think I'm going out too fast.  I went under 10:00 pace for the first mile again yesterday.  If I didn't have to take so many walking breaks, I think that I would be able to hold 10:xx pace the whole time.  Also, my left calf was killing me yesterday and this morning until I hit it with some cold water in the shower.  Adjusting to my new shoes (Pearl Izumi Push+) is going to be a pain in the ass.  *'Up', 'down'...this sounds like the Comrades Marathon...only about 10 times shorter*     ",0

I think theirs a dead body in my bed this morning. Ive said it before and I'll say it again; we are like the new Yeah Yeah Yeah's, except we're dudes.yeah.and we arent nearly as custom-designed. Like maybe if they did more songs like 'Maps'. remember when Karen O. was hot? except for now she looks like some psycho muppet lady in ugly pantyhose.         ",0
"2465","1000866","Student","       YAY!!! I have blogger back. :) YaY!!! I'm so happy. I missed it. I still have this stupid virus thing on my computer. I think I'm going to have my brother fix it when he comes by this weekend. I get to see Maureen too!! She's so awesome and nice and...yeah...I like my brother's girlfriend more than him. Haha, not really but I like her a lot. She's fun to be around.   So, yeah, today was good. I was so so sooo happy it was Friday. I need the weekend. But anyway, I took my french quiz this morning. Really easy. YaY! I think I aced it.   Wind Ensemble was ok. Nothing too exciting happened. Mr. Silder's fiancee came. She's really nice. I mean, I guess I couldn't really expect less considering how nice Mr. Silder is. Math was good. I actually get what we're doing. We had a little mini quiz though. That kind of sucked. I didn't know what I was doing on part of it but I think it will be ok.   Gym was fun...as always. Bowling was cool. I actually didn't do as poorly as the other day. I got in the 80's...WOOOO. Haha. Wow, I suck. In the second game, I was winning. WINNING! The first and...only time that will ever happen against Peter and Brandon. Oh, oh! I got a strike today too! That was pretty neat. And at least one spare so...yeah. YaY for me. I'm going bowling again tonight with them. It shall be interesting. Maybe they can teach me how to bowl correctly. HA.   French...good...boring, the usual. Lunch was kind of dull. I had to retype my whole paper because of the stupid virus and...GRRRRRRRRRRR. I'm not going to start on the virus again but seriously...I'm about ready to castrate my computer. Yeah, anyway, 6th hour was good. Just did some homework. The stalker is sort of back though...that's no fun. He's really getting on my nerves.   History...hmmm...we watched possibly the scariest/weirdest/dumbest video I've ever seen. I just thought it was really really stupid. I felt like I could be doing better things with that time. It's like the Spice Girls movie. OK, THAT was the scariest/weirdest/dumbest movie I've ever seen. Haha...this is definitely reminding me of Lauren's and my conversation last night. Albino Spice...Slutty Spice...wooo.   And then, Satire and Comedy was ok. We talked about the Shawshank redemption. What an amazing movie. If you haven't seen it RENT IT! It's awesomely awesome.   And so yeah....that was just another exciting day at school. And by exciting...I mean...hmmm, I'm trying to think of a good adjective. There's so many. Oh well, Here...I'll make it a fill in the blank kind of thing. You can put whatever adjective you want in there. And by exciting, I mean _______. Wow, that was fun.  Emily drove me home today too, which was nice. I got to talk to her. She's really really cool. I don't get to talk to her all that often and she's a really easy person to talk to, so it was fun.   Ah, I guess I'll go off and...ha, do nothing. No homework for me. :) And the little bit I have, I don't have to do because of Evening With Humanities rehearsal 1st through 6th hour on Monday. Ohh yeah! I'm just sad I'll miss bowling.   I'm out like that poor fat kid in dodgeball. Actually...I'll make it so no one can yell at me for making fun of fat people. I'm out like the blind kid in dodgeball. Yeah....now no one can tell me I'm making fun of anyone but myself. :)     ",0

"2467","1000866","Student","        OK, so, I wanted to change the little picture on the side of my page to Laa Laa, the yellow telletubby. So, I go to google and type in, 'pictures of telletubbies.' And so, I find the picture I want, not even bothering to look at what website it is, then when I go to copy the location on here, it says it's from transexuals.org...    Interesting.     Well, that wont stop me from using a perfectly good picture. However, it does make me wonder why a transexual site that's probably clearly popular, what with having an easy domain name to remember, has a section on telletubbies. I do understand the great debate over Tinky Winky, but really...I don't know. That's a little weird, even for me.    But, anyway, I was looking at some of the pictures and, I realized how long it's been since I watched the show. Look at this place. Who wouldn't want to live there? And, you get more than the nice land, you get the dictator baby face as a sun!           ",0
"2468","1000866","Student","       So, yesterday was alright. This whole weekend's been pretty good actually. I had to work from 1:30 to 7:00 but 'eh, no big deal there. Then, I came home and hung around my brother's party for a bit. That was alright. Then, thankfully, Bryan called and saved me. I went to his house and we watched Aladdin. It was AWESOME. I haven't seen Aladdin in forever. So, good times.   Today I didn't do like...anything. Eek. I feel so unproductive. I watched Chicago and the first Shrek with my family. That was ok I guess. Tomorrow I have to wake up early for that stupid parade. Booo. I don't want to go really. Oh well. What to do, what to do? Anyway, I think I'm going to go sleep for a bit but...I meant to mention this a few days ago to MC and forgot to put it in here. Staying away from those kilts I hope? Hah.   XOXO    ",0
"2469","1000866","Student","       So, today was a good day. I read for the majority of the day, and then tonight I went over to Mary Clare's. Well, first we went to Blockbuster to rent a movie. Haha, I knew it would take forever, and it did. Wow! We all couldn't just decide on a movie. We finally did decide on The Breakfast Club! But than...we realized it was rated R. Haha, we spent forever deciding if we should risk going and trying to get it. Mary Clare had her mom's card with her, but still. It was so funny, and man are we terrible, or I am at least, at doing what I'm not supposed to do. I mean, gosh, I was giggling so much, and...I make a terrible rebel. TERRIBLE! So, we're standing there in line, hoping we get to go to the young guy who looks like he might be more lenient, but nooo, we get the older bald fat guy. He still let us check out the movie. I don't think he cared that much, or the card was fine or something. So, then we went to Mary Clare's and watched it. Ohhh! It's such an awesome movie! It made me happy. I guess I can see why they rated it R in the 80's. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it just had a ton of swearing in it, and I guess some sexual inuendo...  Anyway, after that Kathryn left, and Mary Clare, Kelly, Joanne, and I just kind of sat around and talked. It was fun. I'm glad I'm close friends with them, and have them. They're such goreat friends. They're like my little group of best friends. I have scattered friends outside of that, like band people and whatnot, but no groups like that. We're really all close. I never thought I'd have an actual, 'group' in high school. I guess I always thought I'd be a loner haha. Kind of funny...  We just talked about where we want to go to college, and what we want to do in life, and just some serious stuff. I don't know what I'll do without them when we all go to different colleges. It'll be weird not having them to always go to.   So, after a while, we decided we wanted to go out or something, so we went to Colonial, which was fun too. We sat and ate our ice cream and talked and blah blah. It was fun. And then, we just came home, and that was the evening. Exciting stuff I tell you, exciting stuff. I'm quite content right now with just having ice cream, and having a nice night out with my friends. I think I'm going to go to bed earlier than usual tonight and wake up really early tomorrow, go to church, and clean. YaY for church. Boo for cleaning. Ah well, I'll go read my book probably for another 2 hours. That usually happens even if I go to bed before 1. When I don't, it's even worse. I actually want to go to PrincetonReview.com. Kelly, and Kathryn said it was a good college site to go to.   So, good night to all, and to all a good night. Haha, that was always such a dumb phrase to me...I never liked it much...    ",0
"2470","1000866","Student","       Yeah, so...wow. I'm a bit stressed out right now. A little less then when I was at school though. At least now I'm at home. I'm home alone too. that's always nice when you're stressed out. I have so much stuff I have to make up for school. I'm never going to get caught up. Plus, a lot of people are stressing me out. I'm kind of glad break is coming. But, then I feel like I wont do anything all of break, and I wont get to hang out with people I want to.   Last night actually went really smoothly. I was surprised, but I was so tired by the time I got home. My mom let me go in after first hour since we weren't playing in Wind Ensemble anyway. It was nice to be able to sleep in, but once I got to school the stress just started all over again.   Bowling was like...the only fun part of my day. Actually, bowling and lunch. But, I sucked in my first game of bowling today. Wow...I just...wow. I don't want to talk about my 55. Haha. The second game I got a 103 though. That's three days in a row with a score above a 100. YEAH! Who's the bowling queen?   Erica gave me the greatest present today. Wow. It's amazing. It's this duck on wheels with a pull string, and these three push buttons that are different colors and have different letters on them, and it plays thirty different songs. It's SO amazing. Erica's like...my hero. Whooo!   So, sixth hour was fun. I was playing with that. :)  OK, I'm finally getting to finish this. I just got home from my trumpet lesson. YaY? I just sort of realized something too. I tend to tell all of my stressful problems to Stephen, and I don't even realize I'm doing it until halfway through the conversation, and then I feel really bad. It's terrible. I feel so dumb too. This is why I don't usually complain to people. I feel stupid when I complain. This is why I sort of complain in here, but like tonight...I culdn't have complained about what I needed to talk about in here. Oh well. I give up. I'm just making myself more angry. I think I'll go read some of The Taming of the Shrew.     ",0
