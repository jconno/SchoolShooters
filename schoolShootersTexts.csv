AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"I didn’t understand this when I was younger, but I’ve always had an immense hatred for 
culture. I consider culture to be delusional values which humans mindlessly coerce onto 
each other, spreading it no differently than any other disease. I previously sought to eliminate 
my cultural values to the greatest extent that I could. Through this I expected to gradually 
discover values of an inner self which could be reconciled with this society, so that I could 
engage in activities and pursue goals which would lead to happiness.
Eventually I got to a point where I had sufficiently freed myself from what I called “cultural 
values” when I analyzed all of the things which brought me happiness and all the goals which 
I wanted to pursue, I realized that absolutely everything about those things that appealed to 
me was entirely a consequence of my cultural infection.
Formerly, I had rejected some aspects of culture while accepting other ones, and merely 
not calling them cultural as if those values were somehow transcendent and fine. It was at 
that point that I realized that there is no such thing as an inner self. Any sense of self is a 
delusional cultural construct. I realized that cultural infections were the sole source of any 
possible value beyond base values. For a while, I believed that happiness could be attained if culture could theoretically be eradicated and anarchic primitivism were to take 
hold. Replace all instances of technology with culture in the analytic sections of Industrial 
Society and Its Future and you basically have my mentality at the time regarding the pernicious effects of culture.
The problem was that I’d not been addressing what happiness is. Happiness is merely the 
fulfilment of value, I recognized that if cultural values were eliminated, the happiness which 
results from their fulfilment would not be needed because happiness becomes an unnecessary and incoherent concept when it is removed from its concept — context. A common 
theme in my quasi-anarcho-primitivist thought at the time is that non-base values exist only 
as a consequence of cultural infections and impede on the happiness which results from 
the fulfilment of feral values. As if my feral self is — in short metaphysically the real 
me, whose soul had been devoured by the culturally constructed impostor of the self. But 
my feral self was also an impostor. Just as I realized that I could eliminate non-base values 
and have no need for the happiness which resulted from their fulfilment, I could eliminate 
base-values and have no need for the happiness which resulted from their fulfilment.
It was not only the disease of culture that had been plaguing me all — all along, it was the 
disease of life itself. I was not and I am not in some existential crisis, I’ve never had 
the slightest problem with the obvious nonexistence of free will, objective purposes, and 
all of that. I have always been entirely psychologically capable of accepting my own subjective values and goals, even though I know they are consummately inconsequential, and it 
doesn’t bother me at all. 
The problem is not that I seek meaning and cannot find it. The problem is that I do feel 
immense meaning, and so does everyone else who is alive. Meaning is an abstract interpretation of value which exists only because of life. Just as I sought to eradicate the delusional 
values which culture infected me with, the final solution is the termination of my life, to rid 
myself of all value. The solution cannot be to embrace some aspect of life, as if the erosion 
of delusions is the cause of this. Life is what urgently caused me to have value, and changing 
my life will never do anything but create different delusions than the ones I already have. 
Unfortunately, as of right now I lack the discipline to pursue my death — death and to rid 
myself of the values which delude me, even though I recognize the solution to life is death. 
But I do commend others who do commit suicide. They have freed themselves from culture, 
life, and all value. They have freed themselves from themselves."
AdamLanza,Ramble,"I suppose I should add a video to my channel where I’m not reading something which I wrote before the video, and instead just ramble about ... basically whatever comes to mind, so that I seem like less of a robot. And I . .. I haven’t slept very recently, so I’m probably going to ramble incoherently, but I’m — I’m not excusing my rambling, by really saying that though because I always ramble. But anyway, I was just recently thinking about all of this “it gets better” nonsense, you 
know, with, with um, pertaining to the teenagers being bullied into committing suicide. 
And, uh, just the concept of bullying in general. And I’ve, in my life, I don’t think I’ve ever 
conventionally been bullied. I can’t really remember a single instance, but it’s, it just seems 
so ironic, all of this nonsense. Eve-even though I wasn’t bullied in a conventional sense, I was 
bullied in the normal cultural sense, which everyone is bullied in. And when people speak 
about that, “it — it gets better” nonsense, they say it in the context of, “Well our children are 
being bullied, what can we do to create an environment in which they can thrive?” And that 
seems like such a blatant contradiction to me because it’s really demonstrating the true bul-
lying that’s going on, and that bullying is what every child is subjected to. The imposition 
of cultural values. And the only reason why they oppose . . . um, the conventional sense of 
bullying is because it interferes with their cultural imposition of value. And . . . it’s just, eh, 
children are constantly bullied in every sense of the term, when it comes to their upbringing.
Like, one instance I recently remembered, this . . . heh, this isn’t I guess, a very good representation of what I’m talking about, but I remember when I was about ten years old, and at 
the end of the day in elementary school we would get into lines and go from room to room, 
to gather the kids for the right bus. And I remember that, when I was in the line, we would 
get to a section of portable rooms which weren’t connected to the main hallway so we would 
wait at that door which leads to them. And . . . um, the students, from there, would come join 
the line, and I remembered that usually I would, I don’t, I don’t really remember what I was 
doing but I would frantically signal to them as if there were some emergency. Um, I wasn’t 
serious, I was . . . I don’t know what I was doing, I was just bored I guess.
And anyway, one day I looked through the window from the door leading to the portable 
classrooms, and I saw that the principal of the school was speaking to someone over there. 
And I thought, Oh well, I can’t goof around when she’s there, so I said out loud to the people, 
um, to the other students that were at the line there with me, I said, “Oh the principal is 
there, well, I don’t care,” and by that time I just thought I was going to just, flap around, 
just motion as if there were some emergency, anyway, just fooling around. And 
the vice principal happened to be standing behind me, hearing me say, “Oh the principal’s 
there, oh I don’t care,” and she said the statement, “You should care,” av— as if it were . . . 
eh, something very insightful, and wise. And even though she misunderstood the context 
of what I was saying, it’s ignoring that, just, looking at that statement, “You SHOULD care,” 
and that really . . . is a representation of, what childhood is. It’s children saying, “I don’t care, 
I don’t want your values, I don’t want to live,” and adults constantly saying, “You should care 
about values, you should choose culture, you should choose life,” and that’s what parenting 
and childhood and education and all of that is. It’s just adults bullying children into accept-
ing their values. So how can you possibly criticize people for mocking the homosexuals and 
bullying them in some sense, when you’re the ones who’re incessantly bullying children? 
And, in that vein, um, heh, man, and the children, they grow up to do the same exact thing. 
And they just senselessly propagate these cultural memes . . . forever. It just keeps going on, 
they keep bullying each other, and there’s no point to any of it."
AdamLanza,Ramble,"And this kind of ties into an interest I have, which is . . . well, heh, um . . . basically the way in 
which society treats pedophiles. And before I go any further, I should say, I’m not a pedophile, 
I’ve never knowingly had any contact with any pedophiles . . . at all. And, just strictly an aca-
academic interest in the subject, but . . . it . . . this whole bullying theme, it’s remarkable how 
they can say that homosexual teenagers are being bullied, when any discrimination which 
homosexuals face is infinitely more insignificant when compared to the discrimination which pedophiles are faced aga— wi— um, face against. Um, I mean, first off everyone 
hates you, you’re subject to innumerable hate crimes just right off the bat, but if you’re ever 
known to have engaged in a pedophilic relationship with a child, you’re instantly imprisoned 
for prolonged periods. You’re put on a sex offender registry for the rest of your life. You are brutalized in prison, and people actually celebrate that as if it’s a good thing. And then if 
you’re lucky enough to escape prison with your life, you’re on that sex offenders registry or 
possibly castrated, you are tracked with a Gps device in some instances, and . . . the-there are 
just, so many issues pedophiles face, and everyone seems to think that it’s not a problem at 
all, it’s somehow justified that they’re treated in that manner.
And . . . and, you have to develop such extensive arguments just to refute that delusion, that 
somehow having sex with children is harmful to them innately. When, I’m . . . I’ve written 
an essay that’s already ten thousand and, I’m nowhere near finished and it’s already ten 
thousand words long with eight thousand words and notes that I have to add. It’ll probably 
end up over twenty-five thousand words and it’s just refuting this simple nonsense. And 
basically, all that it really boils down to, is that children aren’t harmed by having sex, the 
reason why pedophilia is opposed is because it combines an atavistic cultural opposition 
to sex with the undermining of authority of adults who relegate children to the property of 
status. Uh, eh, sorry, to the status of their property. I’ve . . . typed that sentence, or forms of 
it, so many times, and it’s really all that it is. It’s just that you’re undermining their author-
ity to impose their cultural values on children, and of course when you interfere with that 
process, people are going to react violently. And it’s . . . not innately harmful for children 
to have sex, it’s . . . so absurd, I’ve never seen a valid argument stating as such. And, um, 
really that’s all that culture is. It’s just the imp— the reason why I’m interested in this topic 
of pedophilia, is not because I have any ties to it, at all. It’s because it really represents what 
culture is. It’s a bunch of lies which exist to propagate itself. Infecting countless children 
for countless generations and just . . . continuing to perpet-perpetuate, heh, I promise in 
the future I’ll make some videos about pedophilia I’m not just gonna leave it on that note. 
Um. My . . . arguments are much more refined than what I’ve just stated, but really it’s just 
a bunch of nonsense."
AdamLanza,Ramble,"And . . . why do . . . people even people seem to think that they’re doing their children a favor, 
when they’re imposing values on them. They’re thinking, My values are so great that a child 
needs to be brought up with them, they, um, they — they don’t really realize what they’re 
doing. And, first off I’m talking about people who actually choose to have children, instead 
of the “Oh whoops the condom broke, guess I just raped the soul of our offspring,” instead 
I’m talking about those people who um intend on having children and intend on giving them 
a quote “better life” than they had.
These people experienced what they consider to be trauma when they were children, saying, 
“Oh my family was too poor to provide for us” or “Oh my family somehow abused us,” and 
because of that they think that they can do their children a favor by changing their behavior 
when having their children. But you’re not doing your children any favors, you’re not, it’s 
like they think that you’re — that somehow that process of parenting is progressing towards 
some enlightenment, but it’s, it’s not doing that at all, the only reason why you would want 
to do that with your children is because, not because you’re being selfless, you’re being 
selfish. You’re trying to remedy your own psychological baggage. I mean, the children have 
nothing to do with it, they don’t exist, they don’t, they aren’t subjected to whatever you were 
subjected to. It’s, uh, I don’t even know.
You don’t do your children a favor by raising them in any way, all that you’re doing is impos-
ing values onto them and they’re going to have to do the same thing to their children, to fix 
their baggage and all of that nonsense. You think that you’re progressing toward something, 
and I’m not saying that you’re not progressing, that you’re somehow deviating from some 
progression or that you’re going in circles. I’m not saying that at all, you’re not going in 
circles, you’re not progressing, you’re, um, you’re not doing anything. There’s no movement at all, you’re — you’re stuck in the zeroth dimension and I’m stuck in 
the zeroth dimension with no movement at all because that’s the structure of life and that’s 
what value demands, you’re jus— you’re not accomplishing anything by doing any of this, 
you’re just trying to fulfill the values that you’ve been instilled with. And if you don’t have 
children, you don’t need to fulfill any of those values. Uh. Not sure where I should go right 
now, I mean, what I should talk about.
It really irritates me how people . . . they seem to say that, why should it be celebrated when 
a child is born? I think that you should say, um, “I’m so sorry for your loss” whenever you 
hear that someone is pregnant. And it’s the same thing with suicide, I used to feel sorry for 
people who committed suicide, but I think they have the right idea."
AdamLanza,Ramble,"And now I commend them, I think that people should throw celebrations when someone 
commits suicide because . . . they’re able to escape this value trap. And . . . heh . . . I wish I were 
that determined, but I’m still psychologically stuck in all of this, I probably won’t be pursuing 
that any time soon, but I’ve never heard a single good argument against suicide. [laughter] 
My favorite one is “It’s selfish to commit suicide!” as if it’s somehow not selfish for those 
people to force that person to live who has already determined that life is not worth living, 
just so that they can fulfill their needs. Or rather their values, you don’t need anything. But 
I guess in the vein of that whole, parenting thing, you imposing values onto your children 
to address your own . . . that’s basically all that politics is, anyway. I used to enjoy reading, um, anything written by authors like . . . Proudhon, Kropotkin, espe-
cially Tolstoy, Emma Goldman, Alexander Berkman, Benjamin Tucker, basically any anarchist 
whether they are — they were individualists or collectivists, I enjoyed all of that, and it — I used 
to think that I was progressing toward something by learning about anarchist philosophy. 
But as if it were somehow anti-cultural, as if I were destroying some [archons?] of the mind. 
But I . . . I was doing no such thing, the only reason why I was ever interested in anarchist 
philosophy is because I felt . . . because of the experiences I had in my life, I felt as if I were 
hurt by the concept of authority. And if I had never been exposed to that concept, I would’ve 
never pursued any of this, anarchist philosophy. And that’s basically an understatement of 
what I was thinking back then. But it, I guess the essence of it. And so that’s all that politics 
is, people who’ve, because of the lives they’ve lived have acquired certain values and they try 
to fulfill that by promoting their political agenda as if it’s . . . somehow progressing towards 
something, but it’s not, it’s just addressing your psychological baggage.
And it’s, it’s all complete nonsense. I wasn’t anti-cultural in the sense that I thought I was 
getting beyond culture. I was — it was just counterculture. And that’s basically, well that’s 
basically all of life . . . and now I’m getting into the incoherent stage. [laughter] Um, anyway, 
people think that, Oh, well of course politics matters, because people’s rights need to be 
enforced, right? But that’s not true because these rights are just another cultural abstrac-
tion. They . . . um, they — they don’t exist at all. Um, basically, I — eh, they say that . . . you 
can somehow derive rights through some criteria, whatever that may be, or those may be, 
and I used to think that that were possible, in some sense. That doing those things were 
possible, but I — I and I used to believe in the concept of logical contradictions, but I was 
just misinterpreting the way in which logic was applied to determine rights. Such as, I used to think it was a contradiction for people to say . . . screensaver just came 
on, heh, um . . . that’s going nowhere. Um, that it was a contradiction for people to say that 
bestiality somehow violated an animal’s rights and yet those same people, the same meat-
eaters, would advocate factory-farming. And they didn’t think that violated animals” rights, 
when how could you possibly say that having sex with an animal violates its rights but killing 
the animals not? It didn’t make any sense to me, but I was just misinterpreting the way that 
they were using their so-called logic."
AdamLanza,Ramble,"They weren’t using their logic so that they could determine what rights existed, they were 
applying their logic so that they could determine how they could best fulfill their subjective 
values. So basically when they saw someone having sex with an animal, they thought, Ew, I 
don’t like that, I should create a right by which an animal can be free from this so I can be 
free from that and then they say, “Oh, bacon is tasty so therefore we should create property 
rights over animals” and “No, animals don’t have a right to live because X.Y.Z.,” and you try 
to refute those assertions but it’s not those assertions upon which their argument is based. 
It’s just based in the fulfilment of their subjective values and that’s really all that rights are.
And here’s another sentence I used to write all the time, or type all the time, but I’ll try to get 
it right: “Rights are just euphemisms for the use of violence against someone who deviates 
from the fulfilment of the subjective values of a group which has the capacity to kill,” I think 
that basically describes it, and that’s really all that it is. It’s just a group with the capacity to 
kill who is coercing people into behaving in ways which allow the maximum fulfilment of 
their subjective values.
And mor-morality is similar . . . not identical, but similar. Um, morality doesn’t exist and I don’t 
mean morality is subjective, I mean moral statements have no validity, they are completely 
incoherent. It’s, um . . . morality is basically just a cultural abstraction of subjective values, 
so people just select arbitrary values and then they say . . . an-and they duct-taped the-them 
together under — under the banner of moral language, and the-they say, “My behavior is 
ethically or morally justified” instead of saying “My value is leading me to act in this way” 
and that’s all there is to th— morality, there’s really nothing more.
Oh man I just remembered, I guess I should comment on this whole race thing, with 
HeyRuka, HeyRuka and whatnot.4 I don’t really understand why . . . if people like HeyRuka 
want to advocate segregation of races be— so that they can, because they value those races, 
because they put value in those races’ value so much that they want . . . that value to prosper, 
in their own settings, if they’re so obsessed with the value I don’t understand why they stop 
at ethnicity instead of some other category because, it’s quite obvious that even among eth-
nicities, their values are radically different so if they love value so much then I don’t know 
why they’re focusing on race, I think . . . it’s probably just another abstraction that only, I 
don’t want to spend time thinking about it because it’s so pointless.
And I’m not saying that, um, we should encourage diversity and . . . I’m not saying that we 
should segregate, because both intre-integration and segregation are nonsensical. They’re 
just two systems under which culture prospers and we all lose. There’s really no difference 
between them. This ties into what I used to, sort of, my prior thinking, I used to address the 
issue of language being cultural. Oh man, I hate language so much, maybe I’ll talk about that 
later. But I used to address the problem of language being cultural, by just saying, “Oh um, 
Esperan— worldwide implil-implementation of Esperanto should solve that problem” it was 
such a trivial, um, way to deal with that, because I wasn’t . . . all that, um, integration allows 
to happen is to — all that it does is kill competing viruses while — to let one virus prosper. "
AdamLanza,Ramble,"There’s really no difference between integration and segregation, it’s just the propagation of culture under different systems. And about language . . . oh man, I have a special place in 
my heart for language because it’s the primary method by which cultural values are coerced 
onto other people.
And you can’t, it’s like the wheezing of someone with tuberculosis. It’s a symptom of it, 
it’s also the method by which it propagates to other victims, and there’s nothing you can 
do about it. You’re for — um, forever stuck with this, language, all these abstractions . . . but 
here I’m going back into my, my anarcho-quasi— I should say quasi-anarcho-primitivist 
ideology when really, it’s not culture that’s the problem, it’s value that’s the problem. It’s 
the structure of value itself, it’s not only cultural value, it’s fler-feral value too. It’s all a part 
of the same nonsense . . . and sort of similar, to the whole race debacle, is the Efilists,5 um, 
even though I’m adamantly opposed to the structure of life, I . . . I differ from the Efilists in 
several regards, and the main issue is their . . . um, they invoke these cultural abstractions 
like rights and morality to further their ideology. And, I’m not appealing to anything, I’ve 
recognized that there’s nothing transcendent about my ideas, they’re just a consequence of 
the life I’ve lived, but it’s kind of like how Jay Sender[?] said, there . . . there are so many people 
from different backgrounds who come to the same conclusion about antinatalism, about 
the structure of life, it’s um . . . ah, not appealing to anything, you can just look for yourself 
at the structure of life and you can see, it’s — it’s just like how Gary6 says it’s, he says that, 
the simplest way, it’s just a need that you did, it’s just a need that need not exist. And that’s 
all that life is, and it’s so easy to see that. That you’re just, fulfilling these values which . . . 
there’s, which have no reason to exist. And I don’t need to say it’s immoral[?] to fulfill that, 
I just say . . . it’s ridiculous according to my own standards, and apparently the standards of 
many other people. I mean I’m not really sure I can communicate this, maybe it’s not even 
possible to communicate this, because of the structure of life. Because I can’t free myself 
from value and still communicate that I hate value.
It’s my value which leads me to hating value. [sigh] And another thing about the Efilists is 
that a lot of them seem to think, that is, eh, it’s, that it’s possible for there to be . . . it’s pos-
sible for there to be an instance under which it would be a good idea to propagate life, that 
if suffering were abolished tomorrow, that it would be okay to bring new lives into the world 
or to live your current life. But I don’t really focus on suffering, at least not directly I focus on 
really, value itself, that’s the problem. Even if there were Paradise tomorrow, and there were 
no suffering forever in the future, I would still be advocating this position because I . . . you 
can sum me up in one sentence: I have a vendetta against value. So instead of an Efilist I’m 
more of a . . . eulavist.7 Eh, I only oppose life because life is the source of value and it’s value 
that I really hate. And, well, I guess that just says it all: I have a vendetta against value. And 
I guess that’s a good place to finish my video, I mean I basically support the Efilists because 
I do hate life and value, but um . . . it’s just that I have several problems with them . . . and 
also the same applies to Gary there are a lot of things I disagree with him about but listening 
to his rants are kind of my idea of pornography. It’s just fun to listen to."
AdamLanza,Ramble,"Oh, and speaking about pornography, if anyone comments on this video, I’m sure that ninety 
percent of them will be about the whole “pedophilia” thing, and I just want to emphasize I 
am not a pedophile, I don’t know any pedophiles, it’s just an academic interest. And if any 
of you, eh, “pedo-phobic” um, inclined individuals want to comment about this, I’d like to hear some unique arguments affirming the position that children having sex is innately 
harmful, because it’s been a really long time since I’ve found a unique argument advocating 
that position. So . . . if you can, try to add some of those in the comments, but . . . um, until 
then, thanks for listening and maybe someday in the future I’ll . . . I will definitely in the 
future make some videos about pedophilia and elaborate on my position, but also someday 
in the future maybe I’ll add another one of these rambling videos, depending on how well 
this comes out. I should listen to it and probably think oh that, about myself, Oh that guy’s 
such a liar, just listen to his voice, listening to his intonation, he’s obviously a pedophile! 
And who knows? . . . Maybe I am.
"
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"Or rather, activist antinatalism, efilism, eulavism — call it whatever you 
want. The point is, there’s no need to even bring suffering into the picture because even eternal 
utopia doesn’t change what “The Good” and “the good” are.
 I should have elaborated on what I meant by this video, but it -was- “at light speed”. This is directed 
toward the people who say things like, “Extinction?! But without humans, there will be no art; there 
will be no nobility; there will be no kindness; there will be no goodness”.
Goodness is the fulfilment of value; value exists only in life. If there is no life, there is no 
value. And thus, goodness becomes an entirely irrelevant concept."
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"So, I did that so that they would say, “Wow this kid is fucked up, I’d better not mess him up 
anymore.” And . . . I’ve, it, uh . . . subordination disgusts me. One of the most grating things 
I can hear is “My parents raised me to believe that” or “My parents always told me that,” I 
. . . It’s . . . I had to cut back to this because I’m trying to think of how I can express this. I, 
you hear things like “I don’t need to spank my children because there’re other methods of 
discipline available,” and I used to think that it could be possible to have children and not 
discipline them, because I perceived values at potentially having some degree of validity, and 
I would think “why do you need to coerce a child into behaving in certain ways when you can 
use reason?” But you can’t use reason because culture, there, there is no reason involved, 
cultural values are not reasonable. Culture, the only way that culture can spread is through 
coercion, and so that’s why parents, even egalitarian ones, focus on the word “discipline” 
because there’s no other way to go about spreading these lies because children will instantly 
reject them. A child can see that all of this is nonsense, and that’s why they go through this 
terrible twos stage, when they’re toddlers they’re incessantly miserable and it’s . . . it’s children 
don’t, offspring don’t naturally rebel against their parents like that.
Um, you don’t see chimpanzee toddlers freaking out about their . . . they have scuffles, but 
they don’t have this rebellion against their parents. And the reason why this rebellion exists 
in humans is because this cultural infection is being involved, they’re trying to rebel against 
this indoctrination process but of course, they always end up ca— succumbing to it in the end 
and no longer see how delusional it is, and even still I . . . I don’t entirely see how delusional 
I am, because I still have this notion that even though I nominally recognize that it’s false, 
I, I still have — I still operate under this belief that it’s possible for value, different values to 
be more valid than other values.
And thinking about this response video caused me to remember that a while ago I saw a 
documentary about bonobo chimps being taught language. Basically, they’re being indoctrinated into accepting culture and I’ve seen some . . . immensely gory shockumentaries, 
but they were Barney compared to the horror that was in this documentary, and in all of 
the videos you can find on YouTube about apes being taught things. Um . . . I’ll link to the 
specific video I’m talking about, but the entire thing was . . . horrible. But I remember two 
particular scenes, there was one where this bonobo chimp was excited and it hopped onto 
a dog, and one of the prison guards um . . . was, um . . . bullying it, saying, “Bad, bad, bad, 
bad” continuously, it was like a nightmare and the . . . you could just tell the chimp wasn’t 
recognizing that what it did was wrong, it was being instilled with this belief that it was bad, 
and it’s . . . one of there was this other scene where, it might’ve been the same chimp but 
I’m not sure. This bonobo chimp was trying to be, they were try— the prison guards were 
trying to teach this chimp language and the chimp, they spend their entire lives in this prison 
complex and these aliens are trying to coerce these stupid things onto them and they have 
no idea what’s going on. "
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"All that they know is that they’re being forced into doing things. And this chimp, um, snapped and, because of all of this, the circumstances of its life, and it 
started attacking one of the prison guards . . . it um, it kicked her, I think, and she proceeded 
to chase it around shouting at it, bullying it, trying to intimidate it, and the . . . the poor chimp 
was terrified and if you want to understand why I hate culture, just watch these videos, those 
two scenes were among the most horrible things I’ve seen in my life because it embodies 
what I went through and embodies what every single other human goes through that’s 
exposed to culture, and it’s the saddest thing imaginable. Just. watch these YouTube videos 
about apes being indoctrinated and you can just see the sorrow and that sorrow is culture, 
there’s nothing more to it, it’s horrible. “I wish I could be indifferent but I am still affected by the solution 
that life is something worth retaliating against” — Well, that is because you overestimate . . . 
the extent to which there is culture. You think that your own values are culture, are culture induced, in fact they aren’t, those would be from you. But how do you distinguish that? As 
you tried to do, you tried to do sorta like a Descartes thing where you sort of went into the 
basement, “What are my values and how do these relate to society,” and tried to figure it 
out that way. Where I had sufficiently freed myself from what I called “cultural values” when I analyzed all of the things which brought me happiness and all the goals which 
I wanted to pursue, I realized that absolutely everything about those things that appealed to 
me was entirely a consequence of my cultural infection. Uh, no, not a cultural infection, that results in your genetics, really.
[Recording of Lanza:] Formerly, I had rejected some aspects of culture while accepting other 
ones, and merely not calling them cultural. Well, why did you accept them? Same reason that people of the 
Bible say, “Oh yeah I like that, I don’t like that,” well why are they like that? Maybe it’s because they resonate with it, so how is that from culture when it’s from you resonating with 
something else? That’s ’cause I realize . . .That’s from YOU, what is the loud self without others? Everything 
self, everything who, is a relation of you, to someone else. Can you find any spot, anything, 
anywhere, where it’s not you in relation to someone else? You might say “oh I write characters in a book,” well that’s you playing and experimenting with yourself in relation to others, 
with yourself. So that simply putting it on a mental level. I don’t think that’s necessarily true. There’s a huge part of what people call 
“the self” but . . . there are two selves that I can identify. There’s the cultural self and there’s 
the feral self. And . . . I think there is a real distinction between the two, I would . . . the feral 
self, I would call that which . . . genetically exists independent from whatever memes the 
creature might be exposed to. So the pleasure that you get from drinking water or climbing 
trees, the pleasure that a feral child would get is feral, it has nothing to do with culture. That 
. . . um, cultural, that cultural self is that which results from enculturation, it values that are 
created which do not exist independent from that cultural exposure. "
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"People do have, independently have some degree of personalities and you can see that in 
animals, and you can take me for instance . . . I’ve always been a compulsive organizer, and 
I don’t think that’s cultural because I exhibited that behavior at an extremely young age. So, 
when I’m in the process of making this video, I watched your video once, thought about it, 
watched it a second time, thought about it, and I was watching it the third time while I was 
typing out the points that I wanted to respond to.
And then when I finished, I rearranged those points and took the most relevant ones and 
then, now I’m responding to those and I’ll insert your um . . . points, and I’m going about 
this in the . . . heh, compulsively organized way because I — I feel compulsion that I can’t 
respond unless I do it in this way.
And I think that compulsion has nothing to do with culture, but the reason I’m making this 
YouTube video at all is entirely cultural. If . . . If I were a feral child, I . . . I would not need to 
fulfill this desire to make this YouTube video, but because I’ve been exposed to this concept 
of YouTube videos, I thus need to fulfill it. And I go about fulfilling it in my own way, but 
the reason why I’m fulfilling it at all is entirely cultural. So, my genetics affect the way I deal 
with these values but the values exist entirely because of culture. And a feral child doesn’t 
. . . have a desire to write or read intricately designed novels, it, that desire does not exist 
at all but being exposed to culture would um instill that desire into them, and they would 
subsequently need to fulfill it. And the same applies to everything cultural and that’s my 
point about the distinction between cultural values and feral values. A feral child would be 
happy drinking water and climbing trees. Interaction is not necessarily cultural, the way that I view an ant colony, I 
don’t think that ants are remotely cultural even though they form these organized societies. 
And, um, they’re, they’re, they’re not taught . . . they’re not exposed to memes which 
results in their behavior, they’re behaving in the ways they do because as far as I know they’re 
. . . responding to certain types of scents at certain frequencies, and it’s like . . . um, needing 
to drink water. They say, “I’m thirsty and I’m going to take this action to fulfill that thirst” 
and I don’t need to be taught that I’m thirsty, I, I just know it. And that’s the way that ants 
operate, and that’s how their societies emerge. They’re not . . . they aren’t instilled with this 
culture, and . . . that feral child who’s drinking water and climbing trees, he, he, if he weren’t 
exposed to anyone else, he would have a desire for social interaction.
That desire itself is not cultural and . . . if he were to . . . like apes in a jungle, the apes, they 
have these very, very, very undeveloped cultures. But most of their interaction is based off 
of feral values, so I’ve . . . there’s this small cultural aspect to their interaction but it’s mostly 
feral. Um, they’re fulfilling their feral values, they don’t need to be taught that they want 
to interact, they just do. The way someone just drinks. And culture can satisfy feral values, 
that’s where it gets a little confusing, because making this video . . . it can be perceived as, 
me making this video can be perceived as trying to fulfill a desire for social interaction. "
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"But 
. . . um . . . the culture doesn’t allow it to happen, it subverts the process by which I would 
naturally fulfill that value. This . . . because I’ve been exposed to this culture, I fulfill that value by making this video, and this video’s just . . . a surrogate, it’s not the social interaction 
itself. If we were in a jungle somewhere, I, I wouldn’t be making this video to you, and I 
wouldn’t have the desire to make this video to you. I would stroke your hair and longfully 
gaze into your eyes, or whatever it is that feral humans do.
So, my point is that . . . culture is the proverbial thug who breaks your limbs and gives you 
a crutch. Culture doesn’t fulfill values, it creates the need to fulfill values and it subverts 
the natural processes by which you would fulfill those values. That’s why I used the disease 
metaphor, culture . . . I, I know it’s needlessly inflammatory, but I think it is kind of an accurate description, even if you aren’t paying attention to those cute little comparisons like 
how language is like the wheezing of someone with tuberculosis and all of those little things. 
Language, I mean, culture doesn’t solve anything, it — it latches onto someone, and it creates 
the need to solve certain things. So instead of calling culture a disease . . . I, I think it would 
be, it could be called . . . the . . . uh, man, I’m gonna have to cut this out and . . . whatever. So everything is delusion? What is delusion? Delusion is that which 
does not correlate with reality, right? Right? Delusion is that which does not correlate with 
reality, is delusional to say that . . . this is a water bottle, if I’m holding up a mouse and I 
mean water bottle, this is not a water bottle, it’s delusional if I think this is and I try to drink 
from it, that is delusional. It is not connected up with how things actually are. Now if you’re 
talking about things that actually are the case, then that is not delusional. I wouldn’t say that everything is a delusion, I’m, I, I don’t know really 
that much about the epistemology but . . . um, I would say that value exists in the sense that 
religious dogma exists. It, this belief in religion exists but all its assertions about reality are 
nothing other than delusions. And in the same way, value exists but it’s a distortion of reality. Um, perception is a coercive delusion, it’s, it exists but as a delusion, (laughter). I know 
I’m just repeating myself but I think I’m getting the point across. The problem is that I do feel immense 
meaning, and so does everyone else. Enjoy it, so it is, it is there, and? I think I’ve addressed this, um, in my, earlier in this video but just in case I 
haven’t, my point is that meaning doesn’t cure suffering, meaning is the source of suffering. “Happiness is merely the fulfilment of value” . . . I disagree. Sometimes you wake up and you’re just happy for no apparent reason, sometimes you just laugh for no apparent reason. "
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"It doesn’t have to be dependent on a lack of something and 
the gaining of something, it’s not all about a lack of stuff, it’s not all about being cultural, 
you attach entirely too much value to culture. Oh, isn’t that an irony? I agree that happiness isn’t like prayer, where first you pray and then your 
prayers are answered. Since happiness is just biological, it’s possible to just be happy, but in 
general the entire point of happiness is to serve as a reward for fulfilling value. First you have 
this desire, and then when you fulfill the desire, you achieve happiness. So, um . . . well a lot 
of the time when you’re randomly happy it’s because you don’t perceive a certain deprivation 
to be important enough to affect your random happiness. I remember reading that one of 
the 9/11 hijackers was asked, eh, um, “Why do you never laugh?” And he responded, “How 
can you laugh when people in Palestine are dying?” And I think that someone like him wouldn’t, because he hav— has this problem, I don’t think that someone like him would ever, 
or at least not very often, experience random happiness. I think he would be suffering a lot.
[Lanza as SomethingSea:] Or, but you prefer to not be alive, and you prefer to . . . see, there’s 
a bit of a contradiction there, you prefer to not prefer? So, you prefer to not prefer so you’re 
trying to not prefer not preferring, or you’re trying not prefer, preferred or not preferring. 
So, your preference of not preferring is getting in the way of preferring not living because 
that would be better than living even though living, that’s a value statement about 
not having value statements because . . . and then you overstate that, such that you hate your 
own values. But itself is a st— is a value statement, ’cause hatred is a value thing and so you 
hating your own hatred, and so you hate yourself. Uh, that’s . . . the problem with all of this. A lot of people like Buddhists and 
Stoics, however they define enlightenment, they believe that enlightenment can be achieved 
in life. That you can overcome what they call “suffering,” but I, my value leads me to hate 
value because well, [laughter] what you said. It’s incoherent and I think the problem about 
that is that I can’t free myself from value and still be alive. So, the enlightenment, which I 
use very, very, very loosely, my enlightenment lies in death where I, I do not have any value. “Culture has values which 
others mindlessly coerce each oth— into, onto each other,” hm . . . that’s true in a spiritual 
sense in that we cannot continue living in this 3d realm without the assumption of these 
value things, i.e., morality this, morality that, it’s basically . . . in order to be alive in this 3d 
realm, you have to have some sort of moral value in going about you. Well not necessarily 
have to, but it’s very likely for it to be occurring, that is the cultural programming."
AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"“Spreading it no differently than any other disease.” 
Um, similar, I’d say not no differently but quite similar. Why do you want to eliminate your 
cultural values? If you eliminate your cultural values, all your values, you cease to exist. Why? 
Because you cease to see any reason to living, therefore you die, by one reason or another. 
Or you continue living and hate yourself the entire time. That doesn’t sound like fun, might 
as well just put a gun to your head and go boom.  That’s, heh, that’s basically the idea . . . um, I don’t want to live, I want to die. What do you mean by you lack the discipline to commit suicide? 
That doesn’t make any sense to me, lack the discipline . . . so, so like when you think about 
committing suicide, what go — what do — what goes through your mind?  I’m definitely not happy to be alive. I . . . um, I, I, would like to die, but the 
reason why . . . when I think about, when I get the thought into my head, You’re going to kill 
yourself in one minute, I . . . um, I . . . I’m compelled to live in the same sense that someone 
who is addicted to cocaine is compelled to continue their indulgence. They — they definitely 
don’t, well, heh, sometimes . . . they definitely don’t want to be addicted to cocaine, but they 
can’t control it because they don’t have enough self discipline. And that’s the problem 
that I have, a cocaine addict will say, “Oh, this — this is the last time, I’m definitely not going 
to do it again, once I take it this last time” but if it were truly the last time then they wouldn’t 
need to . . . indulge with . . . they wouldn’t need to have that last indulgence. So, they’re not 
really overcoming their addiction, they’re just continuing to feed it just as much as they 
were previously and I’m in the same position. I think, Oh, this period of time will be good 
and then I’ll die, and . . . it ends up not being the last period because if it really were the last 
period, I would just kill myself instantly, instead of having to continue to live through that.
There’s, I, I can think of two ways that you can choose to overcome an addiction. The first 
is that you can have the self discipline to recognize that you need to overcome your addiction, and . . . you know that you’ll have an intense desire to persist in your addiction but if you um 
. . . continue to persist in overcoming it, you’ll, that desire will eventually disappear. And I . . . 
I don’t have that discipline. There’s one other way you can choose to overcome an addiction 
and that is to allow your addiction to get you into some circumstances such that continuing the addiction would have more, would have much more intolerable consequences than 
ending the addiction would have. Such as a cocaine addict ending up living in a dumpster, 
blowing strangers for cocaine money, that kind of a thing. And they would feel forced into 
giving up their addiction, and I think that’s the position that I need to be in to overcome 
this, because my life right now is . . . I hate using this word because it’s misleading, but my 
life right now is way too comfortable to . . . for me to feel forced into killing myself. But . . . 
that’s probably going to be the way I die, I’m going to . . . I, I, well either that or I’ll develop 
the discipline to just say, “None of this is helping me I just need to die and I know that I 
won’t want to go through with it at the last second but I just need to do it” and I guess that’s 
the end of the response video, heh, I’m sorry to end on such a macabre note. I know that I 
can kind of “rain on the parade,” but . . . well, hehe, you wanted a response video so here it 
is. Thanks for listening."

AdamLanza,Antinatalism,"Hello, SomethingSea. Thank you for the response to my “My Antinatalism” video. Um, I rearranged some of the things you said so that I could make my response 
clearer, so whoever else is watching this, you should first watch my “My Antinatalism” video, 
so that you can actually hear what I’m saying. And I agree that, um, I speak too quietly, and I 
mumble too much, and my computer’s loud, I’ll — I’ll try to resolve all of that . . . and once you 
watch that video, you should watch his response and then . . . watch this response. Because 
just watching my — this video by itself isn’t going to be an accurate representation of his video.
[Lanza as SomethingSea:] That’s not antinatalism, that’s, uhh, anatalism, suppose that anatalism means “positive of life”? Fuck is anatalism I’m going to look that up. Natalism is a belief 
that promotes human reproduction. Okay, so you would be an anatalist, not an antinatalist 
in that case. I agree that antinatalism is an inaccurate term to be using . . . to describe 
my position. The reason why I use that is because it’s the kind — it’s the kind of terminology that other people on YouTube are using for similar positions, and um . . . despite that, 
I actually do agree with antinatalism, I would like it if life stopped propagating. But I think 
my position can be more accurately stated as antivalueism, or something like that.
[Lanza as SomethingSea:] What, why the emphasis on, on the existential aspect it almost 
sounds like you’re being too defensive? I was being too defensive at that part, um, when I’m trying to figure something out, I open WordPad and then I type in a thought, and then press enter a few times, 
type in another thought, and another thought and it all gradually ends up becoming sort 
of a personal essay. And most of that video came from one of those essays I wrote a while 
ago, but . . . that existentialism paragraph, I took verbatim from what I wrote, so. When I’m 
writing these things, I’m usually in an emotional state and I wrote that after looking online 
for “reasons why you shouldn’t kill yourself,” and I wasn’t trying to find a compelling argument, I was just bored and I found so many people responding to suicidal forum posters, 
saying, “I know exactly where you’ve been, I too have felt that my life was out, was without 
meaning,” and . . . heh, it was ironic because . . . I have the opposite problem. So, I was just 
getting kind of irritated with seeing that relentlessly and not seeing a single person expressing what I was feeling. You’ve always had immense hatred for culture. Why? I wish I could express why I hate culture in one sentence, but . . . that’s, 
um, that’s not going to happen, I’m going to have to ramble about this topic so forgive me 
for that. But I basically perceive culture the way that a normal person would perceive rape, 
and all of these abstractions are . . . the incurable stds in my mind. I’ve . . . um . . . I’ve always 
reacted with terror to culture. Whenev— I’ve always had a problem with authority figures, and 
I would call authority, um, a source which tries to impose values onto you. And so, whenever 
I would interact with someone in an authoritative position, I would, I would always be eager 
to punish myself and hit myself and say how much I deserved to be tortured and that kind 
of thing. And I think the reason why I used to do that, even though I didn’t understand it at 
the time, I think it was because I wanted to try to mitigate um . . . their, quote “discipline” 
of me, even if it was a situation which they wouldn’t even be doing that, it’s just interacting 
with an authority figure would upset me greatly."
AdamLanza,Dream,"I just woke up about ten minutes ago and I had a strange dream so I thought I would explain 
it. The background was basically, long story short was, I was in high school and I wasn’t doing 
what I was supposed to do and told the authority figures to fuck off and I got imprisoned. So, 
ha, after that I was at my prison cell and two of the other prisoners got on guard duty, I don’t 
know. Let me out, one of them was apparently an ex-gang leader . . . not sure why. And they 
led me to a desk where there was this poorly constructed wooden tricycle with low-quality 
rubber wheels or something like that.
We went up to the receptionist’s desk, I don’t know . . . who he was, but he told me good luck 
and I got on the tricycle and started — they brought me over to a door and the receptionist 
told me to get in touch with my young side, or something like that. So, I started breathing 
heavily, thinking “okay I’ve got to prepare for something” as we approached the door. And 
bravely ensued [?] into the room and it was the interior of a gym-gymnasium and there was 
this group of — of . . . spectators sitting on the floor in a circle, around some type of obstacle 
course that was about maybe twenty-five feet wide. And . . . it wasn’t meant to be completed 
vertically, it was a horizontal course that you were supposed to circle around, and there’s 
this star pattern in the center, but a little off to one of the sides . . . and you had to maneuver 
around this course using the tricycle. And make it as entertaining for the crowd as possible.
So, you were supposed to go around five times, for my first round, and there were five other 
prisoners who were competing and presumably whoever the crowd found most entertaining 
would get to be freed from the prison. So, for my first round I was . . . instead of riding the 
tricycle I was, you know how when you . . . have a bicycle you can kind of use the wheels to 
bounce? So that’s what I was doing, I was bouncing twenty feet into the air. And the crowd 
liked that and I threw in some tricks in the second round where I was . . . um, spinning 360 
degrees and that kind of thing, and on the third round I started going backward and the 
crowd really liked that but after a few bounces I accidentally went out of bounds. They were cheering as I was leaving, and of course there was one guy who was saying, “You 
fucking suck” but I sat out with the crowd and started watching the next two 
prisoners to see what they were going to do, that was supposed to be entertaining. Oh yeah 
and the outlines of this obstacle course um, had balloons laid around them, different colors. 
And once I got out of the course, my tricycle turned into this . . . balloon that was starting to 
lose its helium. Well, they — it didn’t have any helium, it probably had a heavier-than-air gas 
in it, all of the balloons did and my balloon, um, was starting to lose its air. But I was watch-
ing the two other prisoners and all that they were — did to be entertaining was play some of 
the, what do they call it? Benny Hill theme music, and starts . . . tossing a balloon between 
the two of them. And I was thinking, “this — that’s, they’re not even doing anything, I’m go-
ing to win this competition” and then that was basically the point at which I woke up. And 
I thought, what was that? So anytime that I’m — end up waking up and asking myself, What 
did I just dream?"
AdamLanza,Suffering,"I’m sure that any psychiatrists (secular priests) and TheRapists who would 
seek to dismiss my position as being the consequence of schizophrenia would orgasm if they read this:
 ~Life is the imposition of value. 
~Cultural values are the masochistic imposition of suffering through the deprivation of their 
fulfillment. 
~Feral values are the innate imposition of suffering through the deprivation of their fulfillment. 
~Suffering tends to serve as a life-affirming experience. 
~The less you suffer, the clearer you see that value is a disease. 
~Death eradicates value and thus is the solution to life.
Relatively speaking and within the context of being alive, I have always been in a very 
privileged position. At this point in my life, I can pursue and achieve practically anything I 
would desire. And if I were to commit suicide, I’m certain that — certain that many people 
would say, “I cannot believe that lazy spoiled loser killed himself. I’ve always been poor, my 
parents beat me, I was bullied every day as a child and I got raped, but despite all of that I 
still choose to live.”
This may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but my position is that someone does not 
choose to live despite suffering, it’s just to live because suffering is life affirming. The way 
that culture operates might help to demonstrate this, the first thing that anyone says when 
someone is suicidal, other than possibly saying, “You need medication to change your 
mentally ill thoughts” is “You need to have goals in your life,” but what are goals? A feral 
child does not have any goals, a feral child would not have any desire to become a renowned 
writer or an eminent scientist, or have interest in hobbies, or become an interesting person, 
or develop any — any of those character-building traits.
However, if that child were encultured, he would develop innumerable goals to achieve 
various things. Culture did not allow the feral child to discover the pleasure which he can 
achieve from experiencing any of those things, culture imposed the deprivation of not achiev-
ing those things, and thus created out of nothing, the pleasure which results from fulfilling 
that deprivation. Culture is masochism. Since life seeks to propagate itself, I suspect that 
culture emerged to prevent human intellect from enabling feral people to lose their aversion 
to death. Ted Kaczynski’s experience is an example of this happening. When he had spent enough time alone in his cabin, he said that he became okay with dying at any moment 
because he was happy with his life.
My interpretation of this is that he had sufficiently overcome his enculturation to the point 
where he was no longer being hurt by it. Since he wasn’t hampered with the deprivation 
which culture imposes, he was not afraid of dying. In the past, the cultural reason why you 
couldn’t kill yourself was because God said so. Or because it will continue some metaphysi-
cal cycle of suffering, or because your parents own your body and suicide is dishonorable. 
These days, the dominant cultural justification for life is this belief that you can’t kill yourself 
because there are things that need to be accomplished in life. But you do not live for the 
achievement of your goals, you have goals so that you will continue to live and thus will 
continue to propagate life.
I used to distinguish between the fulfillment of cultural and feral values, but then I realized 
that feral values are just as coercive of a delusion as cultural values are. I still emphasize 
cultural so much because of how prominent it is, and once you understand that culture is a 
disease, you can recognize that life itself is a disease. The deprivation which results from the 
existence of both cultural and feral values are the only reason why anyone wants to live. Life 
is suffering, everyone has heard that statement, but they don’t accept it at face value. They 
interpret it to mean that life has suffering, but life is suffering, and suicide is the solution."

(partially drunk with a screwdriver) I think a lot. Think . . . think . . . that’s all my life is, just 
shitloads of thinking . . . all the time . . . my mind never stops . . . music runs 24/7 (except 
for sleep), just songs I hear, not necessarily good or bad, & thinking . . . about the asshole 
 in gym class, how he worries me, about driving, & my family, about friends & doings 
with them, about girls I know (mainly   &  ) how I know I can never have them, yet 
I can still dream . . .
I do shit to supposedly ‘cleanse’ myself in a spiritual, moral sort of way (deleting the wads1 
on my computer, not getting drunk for periods of time, trying not to ridicule/make fun of 
people ( ) at school), yet it does nothing to help my life morally. My existence is shit to 
me — how I feel that I am in eternal suffering, in infinite directions in infinite realities. Yet 
these realities are fake — artificial, induced [?] by thought, how everything connects, yet its 
all so far apart. . . . & I sit & think . . . science is the way to find solutions to everything, right? 
I still think that, yet I see different views of shit now — like the mind — yet if the mind is 
viewed scientifically . . . hmm
I dwell in the past . . . thinking of good & bad memories A lot on the past though . . . I’ve always had a thing for the past — how it reacts to the pres-
ent & the future — or rather vice versa. I wonder how/when I got so fucked up w my mind, 
existence, problem — when Dylan Benet2 Klebold got covered up by this entity containing 
Dylan’s body . . . as I see the people at school — some good, some bad — I see how different I 
am (aren’t we all you’ll say) yet I’m on such a greater scale of difference than everyone else 
(as far as I know, or guess). I see jocks having fun, friends, women, LIVEZ.
Or rather shallow existences compared to mine (maybe) like ignorance = bliss. They don’t 
know beyond this world (how I do in my mind or in reality or in this existence) yet we each 
are lacking something that the other possesses — I lack the true human nature that Dylan 
owned & they lack the overdeveloped mind/imagination/knowledge too [?].
I don’t fit in here thinking of suicide gives me hope, that I’ll be in my place wherever I go 
after this life . . . that I’ll finally not be at war with myself, the world, the universe — my mind, 
body, everywhere, everything at PEACE in me — my soul (existence). & the routine is still 
monotonous, go to school, be scared & nervous, hoping that people can accept me . . . that I 
can accept them . . . the NIN [Nine Inch Nails] song Piggy is good for thought writing . . . The 
Lost Highway3 sounds like a movie about me . . . I’m gonna write later, bye. Well well, back at it, yes (you say) whoever the fuck ‘you’ is, but yea. "
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"My life is still fucked, in 
case you care . . . maybe, . . . (not?) I have just lost fuckin 45$, & before that I lost my zippo 
& knife (I did get those back) Why the fuck is he being such an ASSHOLE??? (god I guess, 
whoever is the being which controls shit). He’s fucking me over big time & it pisses me off. 
Oooh god I HATE my life, I want to die really bad right now — let’s see what I have that’s 
good: A nice family, a good house, food, a couple of good friends, & possessions. What’s 
bad — no girls (friends or girlfriends), no other friends except a few, nobody accepting me 
even though I want to be accepted, me doing badly & being intimidated in any & all sports, 
me looking weird & acting shy — BIG problem, me getting bad grades, having no ambition 
of life, that’s the big shit. Anyway . . .

never ends . . . OK enough bitchin . . . well I’m not done yet. OK go . . . I don’t know why I do 
wrong with people (mainly women) — it’s like they are set out to hate & ignore me, I never 
know what to say or do.   is soo fuckin lucky he has no idea how I suffer. Okay here’s some poetry. . . . this is a display of one man [?] in search of answers, never find-
ing them, yet in hopelessness understands things . . .
Existence. . . . what a strange word. He set out by determination & curiosity, knows no ex-
istence, knows nothing relevant to himself. The petty declarations of others & everything 
on this world, in this world, he knows the answers to. Yet they have no purpose to him. He 
seeks knowledge of the unthinkable, of the undefineable, of the unknown. He explores the 
everything5 . . . using his mind, the most powerful tool known to him. Not a physical barrier 
blocking the limits of exploration, time thru thought thru dimensions . . . the everything is 
his realm. Yet, the more he thinks, hoping to find answers to his questions, the more come 
up. Amazingly, the petty things mean much to him at this time, how he wants to be normal, 
not this transceiver of the everything. Then occurring to him, the answer. How everything is 
connected yet separate. By experiencing the petty others actions, reactions, emotions, doings, 
and thoughts, he gets a mental picture of what, in his mind, is a cycle. 
Existence is a great hall, life is one of the rooms, death is passing thru the doors, & the ever-
existent compulsion of everything is the curiosity to keep moving down the hall, thru the 
doors, exploring rooms, down this never-ending hall. Questions make answers, answers 
conceive questions, and at long last he is content."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"Yo . . . whassup . . . heheheheh . . . know what’s weird? Everyone knows everyone. I swear — 
like I’m an outcast, & everyone is conspiring against me . . . Check it . . . (this isn’t good, but 
I need to write, so here. . . .
Within the known limits of time . . . within the conceived boundaries of space . . . the aver-
age human thinks those are the settings of existence . . . yet the ponderer, the outcast, the 
believer, helps out the human. “Think not of 2 dimensions,” says the ponderer, “but of 3, 
as your world is conceived of 3 dimensions, so is mine. While you explore the immediate 
physical boundaries of your body, you see in your 3 dimensions — L, W, & H, yet I, who is 
more mentally open to anything, see my 3 dimensions. My realm of thought — Time, Space, 
& THOUGHT.  Thought is the most powerful thing that exists — anything conceivable can 
be produced, anything & everything is possible, even in your physical world.” After this so 
called “lecture” the common man feels confused, empty, & unaware. Yet those are the best 
emotions of a ponderer. The real difference is, a true ponderer will explore these emotions 
& what caused them.
Another . . . a dream.
Miles & miles of never ending grass, like a wheat. A farm, sunshine, a happy feeling in the 
presence, Absolutely nothing wrong, nothing ever is, contrary 180 [degrees] to normal life. 
No awareness, just pure bliss, unexplainable bliss, The only challenges are no challenge, & 
then. . . . BAM!!! realization sets in, the world is the greatest punishment. Life.

The everlasting contrast. . . .
Dark. Light. God. Lucifer. Heaven. Hell. GOOD. BAD. Yes, the ever-lasting contrast. Since 
existence has known the ‘fight’ between good & evil has continued. Obviously, this fight 
can never end. Good things turn bad, bad things become good, the ‘people’ on the earth 
see it as a battle they can win. HA fuckin morons. If people looked at History, they would 
see what happens. I think, too much, I understand, I am GOD compared to some of those 
un-existable brainless zombies. Yet, the actions of them interest me, like a kid with a new 
toy. Another contrast, more of a paradox, actually, like the advanced go for the undevelopeds 
realm, while some of the morons become everything dwellers — but exceptions to every 
rule, & this is a BIG exception — most morons never change, they never decide to live in the 
‘everything’ frame of mind! It is not good for me right now (like it ever is) . . . but anyway . . . My best friend6 ever: the 
friend who shared, experimented, laughed, took chances with & appreciated me more than 
any friend ever did has been ordained . . . “passed on” . . . in my book. Ever since  7 (who I 
wouldn’t mind killing) has loved him . . . that’s the only place he’s been with her . . . if anyone 
had any idea how sad I am . . . I mean we were the TEAM. When him & I first were friends, 
well I finally found someone who was like me: who appreciated me & shared very common 
interests. Ever since 7th grade, I’ve felt lonely . . . when   came around, I finally felt hap-
piness (sometimes) we did cigars, drinking, sabotage to houses, EVERYTHING for the first 
time together & now that he’s “moved on” I feel so lonely, without a friend. Oh well, maybe 
he’ll come around → . . . I hope.

DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"the everything
Existence . . . to understand
Well well . . . so much changes . . . (like existence). I understand almost everything now . . . 
so close to my love —  . The runes have shown it, she has shown it, I have felt it. I know 
the meaning of each life: to be loved by your love, & to be happy with ones self. Only for the 
gods though (me,  , etc.). the zombies & their society band together & try to destroy what 
is superior13 (what they don’t understand & are afraid of. Soon. . . . either I’ll commit suicide, 
or I’ll get with   & it will be NBK14 for us. My happiness. Her happiness. NOTHING else 
matters. I’ve been caught with most of my crimes — xpl [for example] drinking, smoking & 
the house vandalism, & the pipe bombs. If, by fate’s choice,   didn’t love me, I’d slit my 
wrist & blow up Atlanta15 strapped to my neck. It’s good, understanding a hard road since 
my realization, but it gets easier. BUT IT DOESN’T! that’s part of existence. Unpredictable. 
Existence is pure hell & pure heaven at the same time. I will never stop wondering. The lost 
highway will never end, the music in my head will never stop . . . total [?] part of existence. The 
hall will never end. The love will always be there. GOD I LOVE HER!!! It’s so great to love. Society is tightening its grip on me, & soon I &   will snap. We will have our revenge on 
society, & then be free, to exist in a timeless spaceless place of pure happiness. The purpose of 
life is to be happy & be with your love who is equally happy. Not much more to say. Goodbye.
Almost happiness is slavery — the real people (gods) are slaves to the majority of zombies, 
but we know & love being superior.
I didn’t want to be a jock. I hated the happiness that they have — & I will have something 
infinitely better.
I love her & she loves me.
(By the way, some zombies are smarter than others, some manipulate . . . like my parents.)
I am GOD,   is GOD
the zombies will pay for their arrogance, hate, fear, abandoned, & distrust I love you   that’s all I think about anymore . . . I know that this humanity is almost over, 
that we will be free. We have proven to fate that we are the everything of purity & halcyon, 
& that we deserve, need, love, can’t exist without each other. It’s hard, I think that I might 
not be enough, my mind sometimes gets stuck on its own things, I think about human 
things — all I try to do is imagine the happiness between us. That is something we cannot even conceive in this toilet earth. The everything, the halcyon, the happiness is ours, there 
will be no notes from me. Let the humans suffer without my knowledge of the everything. 
I am trying not to think about the happiness, somehow thinking that  16 will destroy it if I 
conceive/relish in it when I’m a human, but I love her. We are soulmates."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"I love you 
You don’t consciously know who I am (please don’t skip to the back: read the note as it was 
written), & doubtedly unconsciously too. I, who write this, love you beyond infinince. I think 
about you all the time, how this world would be a better place if you loved me as I do you. 
I know what you’re thinking: “(some psycho wrote me this harassing letter)” I hoped we 
could have been together . . . you seem a bit like me. Pensive, quiet, an observer, not wanting 
what is offered here (school, life, etc.) you almost seem lonely, like me. You probably have a 
boyfriend though, & might not have given this note another thought. I have thought you my 
true love for a long time now, but . . . well . . . there was hesitation. You see I can’t tell if you 
think of anyone as I do you, & if you did who that would be. Fate put me in need of you, yet 
this earth blocked that with uncertainties. I will go away soon, but I just had to write this to 
you, the one I truly loved. Please, for my sake, don’t tell anybody about this, as it was only 
meant for you. Also, please don’t feel any guilt about my soon-to-be “absence” of this world 
(it is solely my decision: no one else’s) oh . . . the thoughts of us . . . doing everything together, 
not necessarily anything, just to be together would have been pure heaven. I guess it’s time 
to tell you who I am. I was in a class with you 1st semester, & was blessed with being with 
you in a report. I still remember your laugh. Innocent, beautiful, pure. This semester I still 
see you — rarely. I am entranced during 5th period, as we both have it off. To most people, I appear . . . well . . . almost scary, 
but that’s who I appear to be as people are afraid of what they don’t understand. I denied 
who I was for a long time. Until high school. . . . anyway, you have noticed me a few times, I 
catch every one of these gazes with an open heart. I think you know who I am by now. Un-
fortunately . . . even if you did like me even the slightest bit, you would hate me if you knew 
who I was. I am a criminal. I have done things that almost nobody would even think about 
condoning. The reason that I’m writing you now is that I have been caught for the crimes I 
committed, & I want to go to a new existence. You know what I mean (suicide). I have noth-
ing to live for, & I wont be able to survive in this world after this legal conviction. However, 
if it was true that you loved me as I do you . . . I would find a way to survive. Anything to be 
with you. I would enjoy life knowing that you loved me. 99/100 chances you probably think 
I’m crazy, & want to stay as far away as possible. If that’s the case, then I’m very sorry for 
involving an innocent person in my problems, & please don’t think twice. However, if you are 
who I hoped for in my dreams & realities, then do me a favor: leave a piece of paper in my 
locker saying anything that comes to you. Well, I guess this is it — goodbye, & I love(d) you."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"I LOVE  !! I love her to infinince. I look back on my awareness journey, see the parts & 
sections of my understanding . . . it’s almost done, yet it is never done, I love  . She is 
my soulmate, my [?] all the imaginative halcyons & pure existences I have with her (to me) 
are almost happiness . . . I just wish I could call her. . .something blocks me from calling her, 
my human side is putting up a wall to prevent me from calling her, like a fear of “its” truth. 
BS. I will overcome all fears, doubts, & zombie-based thoughts (oxymoron) . . . I will follow 
our hearts to the halcyon, loving her. I love you. I think
don’t care (?)
Forever fate, up & down spiral
1.5 human years . . . so much changed in small time, my friends (at my choice) are deplet-
ing & collapsing under each other (Eric &  ) like I thought they would, I am ready to be 
with  . The ups & downs of fate are forever, good & bad, equal me. The lost highway, 
& downward spiral never end. Existence is like infinity times itself. ∞∞ [symbolizes infinity 
to the power of infinity] I have passed thru this much of the ever existence, this is almost a 
checkpoint. The zombies have set their [place? plane?] in my mind for the cliff theory I’ve 
[?] off with   & we’ve floated away to the halcyon. The zombies will pay for their being, 
their nature. I know everything, yet I know nothing. I am a true god. My infinite memories, 
thoughts, perceivations of purity come a lot more with her, there is pure pure happiness — the 
purpose of our existence. I hate, love things, hate everything, love me &  . I understand 
that I can never ever be a zombie, even if I wanted to. The nature of my entity. Soon we will 
live in the halcyons of our minds, the one thing that made me a god. Things are so simple, 
now that they are infinitely complicated. HAHAHAHA."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"I understand whatever of everything. I am the god of the everything.
Fate is my only master.
This is probably my last entry. I love my self close second to   my everlasting love. 
Goodbye.
I will never stop learning. This shit again. Back at writing, doing just like a fucking zombie. Lately I can’t change my 
mind from the fucking deeds of zombies. Earth, humanity, HERE. That’s mostly what I think 
about. I hate it. I want to be free . . . free . . . I thought it would have been time by now. The 
pain multiplies infinitely never stops Yet [?] I’m here, STILL alone, still in pain, so is she. 
The thing I have concluded is that fate   will decide when we should be together.   decided 
when our existence started, it should end the same way, with us unknowing, in limbo. I 
love you  . Always have, will. The scenarios, images, pieces of happiness still come. they 
always will. I love her she loves me. I know she is tired of suffering as I am. It is time. It is 
time. I love her the journey, the endless journey started, it has to end. We need to be happy 
to exist truly. I see her in perfection, the halcyons. I await endless purity. I exist as less than 
nothing without her. –O. my humanity, –O. I don’t know if I should call her, or wait for   
to act. Yet, calling her is a state of humanity. I’m forever sorry, infinitely, about the pornos. 
My humanity has a foot fetish & bondage extreme liking. I try to thwart it sometimes to no 
effect. Yet the masturbation has stopped. I’m sorry  . Always I feel the [?] happiness here, 
thinking of her for brief moments. That’s how I know the everything is true."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"I hate this non-thinking stasis. I’m stuck in humanity. Maybe going “NBK” (gawd) with Eric 
is the way to break free. I hate this. The happiness is close visible ending, end of the beginning of the halcyons.
The humanity is blocking me again. Time to go. HAHAHAHA fuck all. Hate this shit, need 
to be me, love her. The framework of society stands above & below me. The hardest thing to destroy, yet the 
weakest thing that exists. I know that I am different, yet I am afraid to tell the society. The 
possible abandonment, persecution is not something I want to face, yet it is so primitive to 
me. I guess being yourself means letting people know about inner thoughts too, not just 
opinions & fashions. I will be free one day, in the land of purity 
& my happiness, I will have a love, someone who is me in a way. someday . . . possibly thru 
this life, maybe another, but it will happen . . ."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"Love is more valuable than anything I know. To love is to enter a completion of oneself. I hate 
those who choose to destroy a love, who take it for granted. love is greater than life even. As I 
look for love, I feel I can’t find it. Ever. But something tells me I will, someday. Somewhere. As my love will find me, she feels as I do right now, I can feel it, we will be inseparable. Her 
& I. Whether it is   or not, I think I’ll find it (my love). We will be free, to explore the 
vast wonders of the stars. To cascade down everlong waterfalls, & thru the warmest seas of 
pure happiness . . . no limits . . . no limits. Nothing will stop us."
DylanKlebold,Thoughts,"The humanity of here & now clouds all that I see. Yet the me, the one, can now control the 
pain, & it is done. 5 more days. 5 . . . . . . a very influential number, another brick in my jour-
neyed wall. Humans are zombies, they scratch for acceptance & greed & kill themselves thru 
each other. They will never learn, or maybe they will, but wont have the strength to learn 
to be aware is not a trait, it’s a godlike thing. Blessed God, not a Christian, Jesus, Mt. Sinai, 
Abraham, David, Bible gay shit god, but a true controller of existence.   was to make us this 
way. These moments will be lost in the depressions & caverns of the human books forever, 
like, tears, in, rain, but the thoughts will be eternal. To explain the happiness is impossible 
even for fate. It’s just a pure halcyon set to last more existences than a conceivable number. 
Stupid gay nigger humans think I’m “crazy.” Or they think I’m childish. Hahaha, because 
I can’t solve [math equation]. That makes me dumb! Because I can’t stay thinking in a 2nd 
dimension, I go to the 5th!17 Haha. So I wait 5 more days. 5 more days. 5 eternities, & I know 
her & I are all conceived from ourselves & each other, every night of the self-awareness journey, every thought we conceived, we have finished the race. Time to die. Everything we 
knew we were able to understand it, to perceive it, into what we should. Everything we knew, 
we know & use. An understanding of the everything. An Einstein stuck in an ant’s body. 
We are the nature of existence. The zombies were a test, to see if our love was genuine. We 
are in wait of our reward, each other. The zombies will never cause us pain anymore. The 
humanity was a test. I love you, love. Time to die, time to be free, time to love. One day, one is the beginning, [?] the end. Hahaha. Reversed, yet true. About 26.5 hours 
from now the judgment will begin. Difficult, but not impossible, necessary, nerve-wracking 
& fun.
What fun is life without a little death?
It’s interesting, when I’m in my human form, knowing I’m going to die. Everything has a 
touch of triviality to it. Like how none of this calculus shit matters. The way it shouldn’t. 
the truth. In 26.4 hours, I’ll be dead, & in happiness. The little zombie human fags will 
know their errors, & be forever suffering and mournful. HAHAHAH, of course I will miss 
things. Not really. Ok, this is my will. This is a fucking human thing to do, but whatever.
 — you were a badass, never failed to get me up when I was down. Thx. You get
FUCKED."
EricHarris,Journal,"I hate the fucking world, too much god damn fuckers in it. Too many thoughts and different 
societies all wrapped up together in this fucking place called AMERICA. Everyone has their 
own god damn opinions on every god damn thing and you may be saying “well what makes 
you so different?” because I have something only me and V1 have, SELF AWARENESS. Call 
it existentialism or whatever the fuck you want. We know what we are to this world and 
what everyone else is. We learn more than what caused the civil war and how to simplify 
quadratics in school. We have been watching you people. We know what you think and how 
you act. All talk and no actions. People who are said to be brave or courageous are usually 
just STUPID. Then they say later that they did it on purpose cause they are brave when they 
did [it] on fucking accident. GOD everything is so corrupt and so filled with opinions and 
points of view and people’s own little agendas and schedules. This isn’t a world anymore. 
It’s HOE2 and no one knows it. Self awareness is a wonderful thing. I know I will die soon, so will you and everyone else. Maybe we will be 
lucky and a comet will smash us back to day 1. people say it is immoral to follow others, they 
say be a leader. Well here is a fuckin news flash for you stupid shits, everyone is a follower! 
Everyone who says they aren’t followers and then dresses different or acts different . . . they 
got that from something they saw on TV or in film or in life. No originality. How many Jo 
MAMMA jokes3 are there and how many do you think are original and not copied. KEINE 
[German: none]. It’s a fucking filthy place we live in. All these standards and laws and great 
expectations [?] are making people into robots even though they might “think” they aren’t 
and try to deny it. No matter how hard I try to NOT copy someone I still AM! Except for this 
fucking piece of paper right here, and BTW [by the way] spelling is stupid unless I say, I say 
spell it how it sounds, it’s the fuckin easiest way! Hey try this sometime, when someone 
tells you something, ask “why?” eventually they will be stumped and can’t answer any more. 
That’s because they only know what they need to know in society and school. Not real life 
science. They will end up saying words = to this “because! Just shut up!” People that only 
know stupid facts that aren’t important should be shot, what fucking use are they. NATURAL 
SELECTION. Kill all retards, people with brain fuck ups, drug addicts, people who can’t figure out how to use a fucking lighter. Geeeawd! People spend millions of dollars on sav-
ing the lives of retards, and why. I don’t buy that shit like “oh, he’s my son, though!” so the 
fuck what, he ain’t normal, kill him. Put him out of his misery. He is only a waste of time 
and money, then people say “but he is worth the time, he is human too.” No he isn’t, if he 
was then he would swallow a bullet cause he would realize what a fucking [illegible] he was."
EricHarris,Journal,"As I said before, self-awareness is a wonderful thing. I know what all you fuckers are think-
ing and what to do to piss you off and make you feel bad. I always try to be different, but I 
always end up copying someone else. I try to be a mixture of different things and styles, but 
when I step out of myself I end up looking like others or others THINK I am copying. One 
big fucking problem is people telling me what to fuckin do, think, say, act, and everything 
else. I’ll do what you say IF I feel like it. But people (ie, parents, cops, God, teachers) telling 
me what to [arrow to “do, think, say, act”] makes me not want to fucking do it! That’s why 
my fucking name is REB!!! No one is worthy of shit unless I say they are. I feel like God and 
I wish I was, having everyone being OFFICIALLY lower than me. I already know that I am 
higher than most anyone in the fucking welt [German: world] in terms of universal Intel-
ligence. And where we stand in the universe compared to the rest of the UNIVERSE. and if 
you think I don’t know what I’m talking about then you can just “BUCK DICH” [German: 
bend over]4 and saugen mein hund [German: suck my dog]! Isn’t America supposed to be the 
land of the free? How come, If I’m free, I can’t deprive a stupid fucking dumbshit from his 
possessions if he leaves them sitting in the front seat of his fucking van out in plain sight 
and in the middle of fucking nowhere on a Frifuckingday night.5 NATURAL SELECTION. 
Fucker should be shot. Same thing with all those rich snotty toadies at my school. Fuckers 
think they are higher than me and everyone else with all their $ just because they were born 
into it? Ich denk NEIN [German: I think not]. BTW [by the way], “sorry” is just a word. It 
doesn’t mean SHIT to me. Everyone should be put to a test, an ULTIMATE DOOM test, see who can survive in an environment using only ‘smarts’ 
and military skills. Put them in a Doom world, no authority, no refuge, no BS copout excuses. 
If you can’t figure out the area of a triangle or what “cation” means, you die! If you can’t 
take down a demon with a chainsaw or kill a hell prince with a shotgun, you die! Fucking 
snotty rich fuckheads   [apparently a name] who rely on others or on sympathy or $ to 
get them through life should be put to this challenge. Plus it would get rid of all the fat, 
retarded, crippled, stupid, dumb, ignorant, worthless people of this world. No one is worthy 
of this planet, only me and who ever I choose, there is just no respect for anything higher 
than your fucking boss or parent. Everyone should be shot out into space and only those 
people I say should be left behind. "
EricHarris,Journal,"Ever wonder why we go to school? Besides getting a so-called education. It’s not too obvious 
to most of you stupid fucks but for those who think a little more and deeper you should 
realize it. Its society’s way of turning all the young people into good little robots and factory 
workers. That’s why we sit in desks in rows and go by bell schedules, to get prepared for the 
real world cause “that’s what its like.” Well god damn it no it isn’t! one thing that separates 
us from other animals is the fact that we can carry actual thoughts. So why don’t we? People 
go on day by day routine shit. Why can’t we learn in school how we want to, why can’t we sit 
on desks and on shelves and put our feet up and relax while we learn? Cause that’s not what 
the “real world is like.” Well hey fuckheads, there is no such thing as an actual “real world.” 
Its just another word like justice, sorry, pity, religion, faith, luck and so on. We are humans, 
if we don’t like something we have the fucking ability to change! But we don’t, at least you 
don’t, I would. You just whine/bitch throughout life but never do a goddamn thing to change 
anything. “man can eat, drink, fuck, and hunt and anything else he does is madness” — Based 
on Lem’s quote.6 Boy oh fuckin boy is that true. When I go NBK7 and people say things like, 
“oh, it was so tragic,” or “oh he is crazy!” or “It was so bloody.” I think, so the fuck what you 
think that’s a bad thing? Just because your mumsy and dadsy told you blood and violence is 
bad, you think it’s a fucking law of nature? Wrong. Only science and math are true, everything, 
and I mean everyfuckingthing else is Man made. My doctor wants to put me on medication8 
to stop thinking about so many things and to stop getting angry. Well, I think that anyone 
who doesn’t think like me is just bullshitting themselves. Try it sometime if you think you 
are worthy, which you probably will you little shits, drop all your beliefs and views and ideas 
that have been burned into your head and try to think about why your here. But I bet most of 
you fuckers can’t even think that deep, so that is why you must die. How dare you think that 
I and you are part of the same species when we are sooooooo different.9 You aren’t human. 
You are a robot. You don’t take advantage of your capabilities given to you at birth. You just 
drop them and hop onto the boat and head down the stream of life with all the other fuckers 
of your time. Well god damn it I won’t be part of it! I have thought too much, realized too 
much, found out too much, and I am too self aware to just stop what I am thinking and go 
back to society because what I do and think isn’t “right” or “morally accepted.” NO, NO, NO. 
God fucking damn it NO! I will sooner die than betray my own thoughts. But before I leave 
this worthless place, I will kill who ever I deem unfit for anything at all. Especially life. And 
if you pissed me off in the past, you will die if I see you. Because you might be able to piss 
off others and have it eventually blow over, but not me. I don’t forget people who wronged 
me, like  . He will never get a chance to read this because he will be dead by me before 
this is discovered."
EricHarris,Journal,"The human race sucks. Human nature is smothered out by society, job, and work and school. 
Instincts are deleted by laws. I see people say things that contradict themselves, or people that 
don’t take any advantage to the gift of human life. They waste their minds on memorizing 
the stats of every college basketball player or how many words should be in a report when 
they should be using their brain on more important things. The human race isn’t worth fighting for anymore. WWII was the last war worth fighting and was the last time human life and human brains did any good 
and made us proud. Now, with the government having scandals and conspiracies all over 
the fucking place and lying to everyone all the time and with worthless, pointless, mind-
less, disgraceful TV shows on and with everyone ob-fucking-sessed with Hollywood and 
beauty and fame and glamour and politics and anything famous, people just aren’t worth 
saving. Society may not realize what is happening but I have; you go to school, to get used 
to studying and learning how your “supposed to” so that drains or filters out a little bit of 
human nature. But that’s after your parents taught you what’s right and wrong even though 
you may think differently, you still must follow the rules. After school you are expected to 
get a job or go to college. To have more of your human nature blown out your ass. Society 
tries to make everyone act the same by burying all human nature and instincts. That’s what 
schools, laws, jobs, and parents do. If they realize it or not. And them, the few who stick to 
their natural instincts are casted out as psychos or lunatics or strangers or just plain differ-
ent. crazy, strange, weird, wild, these words are not bad or degrading. If humans were let to 
live how we would naturally, it would be chaos and anarchy and the human race wouldn’t 
probably last that long, but hey guess what, that’s how it’s supposed to be!!!!! Societies and 
government are only created to have order and calmness, which is exactly the opposite of 
pure human nature. Take away all your laws and morals and just see what you can do if the 
governments in our own little so called self-created “civilized world” and get rid of all those 
damn [or Darwin?] instincts everyone has!! Bullshit. I’m too tired to write anymore tonight, 
so until next time, fuck you all. It has been confirmed, after getting my yearbook10 and watching people like   and the human race isn’t worth fighting for, only worth killing. Give the Earth back to the ani-
mals, they deserve it infinitely more than we do. Nothing means anything anymore, most 
quotes are worthless, especially the rearranged ones like “don’t fight your enemies, make 
your enemies fight.” You know, quotes that use the same phrase just rearranged, Dumb 
fuck shit [illegible] it’s funny, people say “you shouldn’t be so different” to me, and 1st I say 
fuck you don’t tell me what I should and shouldn’t be and 2nd mother fuckers different is 
good, I don’t want to be like you or anyone which is almost impossible this day with all the 
little shits trying to be “original copycats”, I expect shits like you to criticize anyone who isn’t 
one your social words, “normal” or “civilized” — see: Tempest and Caliban. All you degrading 
worthless shits all caught up and brainwashed into the 90’s society. “what? You AREN’T 
going to college, are you crazy!” holy SHIT that is one fucking BIG quote that just proves 
my point. Step back and look at yourself fuckers, I dare you, maybe I’ll get lucky and you’ll 
step back to far like Nick in E1M311 with the same consequence."
EricHarris,Journal,"Wooh, different pen. HA! All right you pathetic fools listen up; I have figured it out. The hu-
man race strives for excellence in life and community always wanting to bring more good
into the community. And nullify “bad” things. Anyone who thinks differently than the majority 
or the leaders is deemed “unusual” or weird or crazy. People want to be a part of something, 
a family, a service, a club, a union, a community, whatever. That’s what humans want. Who 
cares what you as an individual thinks, you must do what you are told, whether it is jump off 
a bridge or drive on the right side of the road. Protesters in the past protested because the 
human race that was dominant (Ghandhi and the Brits or the king or the Americans) wasn’t 
working out = they had fault = they failed = their ideas didn’t work. Humans don’t change 
that much, they only get better technology to do their work quicker/easier. People always say 
we shouldn’t be racist. Why not? Blacks ARE different. Like it or not they are. They started 
out on the bottom so why not keep em there. It took them centuries to convince us that they 
are equal but they still use their color as an excuse or they just discriminate us because we 
are white. Fuck you, we should ship yer black asses back to Afrifuckingca were you came 
from. We brought you here and we will take you back. America = white. Gays. . . . well all 
gays, ALL gays, should be killed. without questions. Lesbians are 
fun to watch if they are hot but still, its not human. It’s a fucking disease. You don’t see 
bulls or roosters trying to fuck, do you? No, I didn’t think so. Women, you will always be under men. It’s been seen throughout nature, males are almost always doing the dangerous shit while the women 
stay back. It’s your animal instincts, deal with it or commit suicide, just do it quick. That’s 
all for now. If you recall your history the Nazis came up with a “final solution” to the Jewish problem. Kill 
them all. Well, in case you haven’t figured it out yet, I say “KILL MANKIND” no one should 
survive. We all live in lies [?]. People are always saying they want to live in a perfect society, 
well utopia doesn’t exist. It is human to have flaws. You know what. Fuck it. Why should 
I have to explain myself to you survivors when half of this shit I say you shitheads won’t 
understand and if you can then woopie fucking do. That just means you have something 
to say as my reason for killing. And the majority of the audience won’t even understand my 
motives either! They’ll say “ah, he’s crazy, he’s insane, worthless! All you fuckers should die! 
DIE! What the fuck is the point if only some people see what I am saying, there will always 
be ones who don’t, ones that are to dumb or naïve or ignorant or just plain retarded. If I 
can’t pound it into every single persons head then it is pointless. Fuck money fuck justice 
fuck morals fuck civilized fuck rules fuck laws . . . DIE manmade words . . . people think 
they apply to everything when they don’t/can’t. There’s no such thing as True Good or True 
evil, it’s all relative to the observer. It’s just all nature, chemistry, and math. Deal with it. But 
since dealing with it seems impossible for mankind, since we have to slap warning labels 
on nature, then . . . you die, burn, melt, evaporate, decay. Just go the fuck away. YAAAAAA!!!
“When in doubt, confuse the hell out of the enemy.” Fly 9/2/9812
without mercy!  wait, mercy doesn’t exist. . . ."
EricHarris,Journal,"Here’s something to chew on . . . today I saw a program on the discovery channel about 
satellites and radar and aircraft and stuff, and at the end of the show the narrator said some 
things that made me think “damn, we are so advanced, we kick ass, America is awesome, we have so many things in our military, we would kick anyone’s ass.” For a minute I actually 
had some pride in our nation . . . then I realized, “hey, this is only the GOOD things that I 
am seeing here. Only the pros, not the cons. Maybe that’s what people see, only the pros, 
and that’s why they are under control, but me, I see all . . . you can only blind me for so long, 
but alas, I have realized that Yes, the human race is still indeed doomed. It just needs a few 
kick starts, like me, and hell, maybe even  . If I can wipe a few cities off the map, and 
even the fuckhead holding the map, then great. Hmm, just thinking if I want all humans 
dead or maybe just the quote-unquote “civilized, developed, and known-of” places on Earth, 
maybe leave little tribes of natives in the rain forest or something. Hmm, I’ll think about 
that. Eh, done for tonight. As part of the human race, and having the great pleasure of being blessed with a brain, I can think. Humans can do whatever they want. There is no laws of nature that prevent 
humans from making choices. Maybe from actually DOING some of those choices, but not 
from making the choice. If a man chooses to speed while driving home one day then it is 
his fault for whatever happens. If he crashes into a school bus full of kiddies and they all 
burn to death, it’s his fault. It’s only a tragedy if you think it is, and then it’s only a tragedy 
in your own mind so you shouldn’t expect others to think that way also. It could also be a 
miracle for another person maybe that bus stopped the car from plowing into a little old 
lady walking on the sidewalk, one could think it was a “miracle” that she wasn’t hit. You see, 
anything and everything that happens in our world is just that, a HAPPENING. Anything 
else is relative to the observer, but yet we try to have a “universal law” or “code” of what is 
good and bad and that just isn’t fuckin correct. We shouldn’t be allowed to do that. We aren’t 
GODS, just because we are at the top of the food chain with our technology doesn’t mean 
we can be “judges” of nature. Sure we can think what we want, but you can “think” and “behave” you can judge people and nature all you want, but you are still wrong! Why should your morals apply to 
everyone else. “Morals” is just another word, and that’s it. I think we are all a waste of natural 
resources and should be killed off, and since humans have the ability to choose . . . and I’m 
human . . . I think I will choose to kill and damage as much as nature allows me to so take 
that, fuck you, and eat napalm + lead! HA! Only nature can stop me. I know I could get shot 
by a cop after only killing a single person, but hey guess the fuck WHAT! I chose to kill that 
one person so get over it! It’s MY fault! Not my parents, not my brothers, not my friends, not 
my favorite bands, not computer games, not the media. IT is MINE! Go shut the fuck up!"
EricHarris,Journal,"Someone’s bound to say “what were they thinking?” when we go NBK or when we were 
planning it, so this is what I am thinking. “I have a goal to destroy as much as possible so 
I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy, mercy, or any of that, so I will force 
myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from Doom like FH [Former Human, 
mob in Doom] or FS [Former Sergeant] or demons, so it’s either me or them. I have to turn 
off my feelings.” Keep this in mind, I want to burn the world, I want to kill everyone except 
about 5 people, who I will name later, so if you are reading this you are lucky you escaped 
my rampage because I wanted to kill you. It will be very tricky getting all of our supplies, 
explosives, weaponry, ammo, and then hiding it all and then actually planting it all so we 
can achieve our goal. But if we get busted any time, we start killing then and there, just like 
Wilks from the ALIENS books [comic books], I ain’t going out without a fight.  Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max 
in the school alone who I don’t want to die, the rest, MUST FUCKING DIE! If I didn’t like 
you or if you pissed me off and lived through my attacks, consider yourself one lucky god 
damn NIGGER. Pity that a lot of the dead will be a waste in some ways, like dead hot chicks 
who were still bitches, they could have been good fucks. Oh well, too fucking bad. Life isn’t 
fair. . . . not by a long fuckin shot when I’m at the wheel, too. God I want to torch and level 
everything in this whole fucking area but bombs of that size are hard to make, and plus I 
would need a fuckin fully loaded A-10 to get every store on Wadsworth and all the buildings 
downtown. Heh, imagine THAT you fuckers, picture half of Denver on fire just from me 
and Vodka. Napalm on sides of skyscrapers and car garages blowing up from exploded gas 
tanks. . . . oh man that would be beautiful. You know what, I feel like telling about lies. I lie a lot. Almost constant, and to everybody, just to keep my own ass out of the water. And by the way (side note) I don’t think I am doing this for attention, as some people may think. Let’s see, what are some big lies I have told; “yeah 
I stopped smoking;” “for doing it not for getting caught,” “no I haven’t been making more 
bombs,” “no I wouldn’t do that,” and of course, countless of other ones, and yeah I know 
that I hate liars and I am one myself, oh fucking well. It’s ok if I am a hypocrite, but no one 
else, because I am higher than you people, no matter what you say if you disagree I would 
shoot you. And I am one racist mother fucker too, fuck the niggers and spics and chinks, 
unless they are cool, but sometimes they are so fucking retarded they deserve to be ripped on. 
Some people go through life begging to be shot, and white fucks are just the same. If I could 
nuke the world I would, because so far I hate you all. There are probably around 10 people 
I wouldn’t want to die, but hey, who ever said life is fair should be shot like the others, too."
EricHarris,Journal,"I sure had fun this weekend. Let’s see, what really happened. Before going to 
Rock-n-Bowl we stopped by King Soopers and me and   picked up some big ass stogies. 
We then went to Rock-n-Bowl and I had a few cigarettes and one of my brand new cigars. 
We then went back to  ’s house where her mom had previously bought us all a fuck 
load of liquor. Personally I had asked for Tequila and Irish cream, Vodka got his Vodka, and 
there was beer, whiskey, schnapps, puckers, scotch, and of course, orange juice! So we had 
some fun there playing cards and making drinks. We eventually made it to bed at about 5 
AM. Got up at 10, went to Safeway got some doughnuts and then I took Vodka home. The 
bottle of Tequila is almost full and is in my car right by my spare tire and right by the bottle 
of Irish Cream. Heh heh. I’ll have to find a spot for those. And by the way, this Nazi report13 
is boosting my love of killing even more. Like the early Nazi government, my brain is like a 
sponge, sucking up everything that sounds cool and leaving out all that is worthless. That’s 
how Nazism was formed, and that’s how I will be too! Fuck you Brady!14 All I want is a couple of guns, and thanks to your fucking bill I will probably not get any! Come on, I’ll have a clean record and I only want them for personal protection. It’s not like I’m some psycho who would go on a shooting spree. . . . fuckers. I’ll 
probably end up nuking everything and fucking robbing some gun collector’s house. Fuck, 
that’ll be hard. Oh well, just as long as I kill a lot of fucking people. Everyone is always 
making fun of me because of how I look, how fucking weak I am and shit, well I will get 
you all back, ultimate fucking revenge here.15 You people could have shown more respect, 
treated me better, asked for my knowledge or guidance more, treated me more like a senior, 
and maybe I wouldn’t have been so ready to tear your fucking heads off. Then again, I have 
always hated how I looked, I make fun of people who look like me, sometimes without even 
thinking sometimes just because I want to rip on myself. That’s where a lot of my hate grows 
from. The fact that I have practically no self-esteem, especially concerning girls and looks 
and such. Therefore people make fun of me . . . constantly . . . therefore I get no respect and 
therefore I get fucking PISSED. As of this date I have enough explosions to kill about 100 
people, and then if I get a couple bayonets, swords, axes, whatever I’ll be able to kill at least 
10 more. And that just isn’t enough! Guns! I need guns! Give me some fucking firearms!"
EricHarris,Journal,"HATE! I’m full of hate and I love it. I HATE PEOPLE and they better fucking fear me if they 
know what’s good for ’em. Yes I hate and I guess I want others to know it, yes I’m a racist 
and I don’t mind. Niggs and spics bring it on to themselves, and another thing, I am very 
racist towards white trash P.O.S.’s [piece of shits] like   and   they deserve the hatred, 
otherwise I probably wouldn’t hate them. It’s a tragedy, the human nature of people will lead 
to their downfall. People’s human nature will get them killed. Whether by me or Vodka, it’s 
happened before, and not just school shootings like those pussy dumbasses over in Min-
nesota who squealed.16 Throughout history, its our fucking nature! I know how people are 
and why and I can’t stand it! I love the Nazis too . . . by the way, I fucking can’t get enough 
of the swastika, the SS, and the iron cross. Hitler and his head boys fucked up a few times 
and it cost them the war, but I love their beliefs and who they were, what they did, and what 
they wanted. I know that form of government couldn’t have lasted long once the human 
equation was brought in, but damn it, it sure looked good. Every form of government leads 
to downfalls, everything will always fuck up or yeah something. It’s all doomed, god damn 
it. This is beginning to make me get in a corner. I’m showing too much of myself, my views 
and thoughts, people might start to wonder, smart ones will get nosy and something might 
happen to fuck me over, I might need to put on one helluva mask here to fool you all some 
more. Fuck fuck fuck. It’ll be very fucking hard to hold out until April. If people would give 
me more compliments all of this might still be avoidable . . . but probably not. Whatever I 
do people make fun of me, and sometimes directly to my face. I’ll get revenge soon enough. 
Fuckers shouldn’t have ripped on me so much huh!17 Ha! Then again it’s human nature 
to do what you did . . . so I guess I am also attacking the human race. I can’t take it, it’s not 
right . . . true . . . correct . . . perfect. I fucking hate the human equation. Nazism would be 
fucking great if it weren’t for individualism and our natural instinct to ask questions. You 
know what maybe I just need to get laid. Maybe that’ll just change some shit around. That’s 
another thing, I am a fucking dog. I have fantasies of just taking someone and fucking them 
hard and strong. Someone like   where I just pick her up, take her to my room, tear off 
her shirt and pants and just eat her out and fuck her hard. I love flesh . . .  weisses fleisch! 
Dein weisses fleisch erregt mich so, Ich bin doch nur ein Gigolo! [German: Your white flesh 
excites me so, I am just a gigolo18]. I want to grab a few different girls in my gym class, take 
them into a room, pull their pants off and fuck them hard. I love flesh . . . the smooth legs, 
the large breasts, the innocent flawless body, the eyes, the hair, jet black, blond, white, brown, 
ahhh I just want to fuck! Call it teenager hormones or call it a crazy fuckin racist rapist. Es 
ist mir egal [German: it’s all the same to me]. "
EricHarris,Journal,"I just want to be surrounded by the flesh of a woman, someone like   who I wanted to 
just fuck like hell, she made me practically drool, when she wore those shorts to work . . . 
instant hard on . . . I couldn’t stop staring. And others like   
[several names] in my gym class,   or whatever in my gym class, and others who I just 
want to overpower and engulf myself in them. Mmm. I can taste the sweet flesh now . . . the 
salty sweet, the animalistic movement . . . iccchhh . . . lieeebe . . . . . . . fleisccchhhh [German: 
I love flesh]. “Weisses fleisch” — perfect song for me.  Who can I trick into my room first? I 
can sweep someone off their feet, tell them what they want to hear, be all nice and sweet, 
and then “fuck ’em like an animal, feel them from the inside” as Reznor19 said. Oh — that’s 
something else . . . that one NIN [Nine Inch Nails] video I saw, “Broken” or “Closer”20 or 
something. The one where the guy is kidnapped and tortured like hell . . . actual hell. I want 
to do that too. I want to tear a throat out with my own teeth like a pop can. I want to gut 
someone with my hand, to tear a head off and rip out the heart and lungs from the neck, to 
stab someone in the gut, shove it up to their heart, and yank the fucking blade out of their 
rib cage! I want to grab some weak little freshman and just tear them apart like a wolf, show 
them who is god. Strangle them, squish their head, bite their temples in the skull, rip off 
their jaw, rip off their collar bones, break their arms in half and twist them around, the lovely 
sounds of bones cracking and flesh ripping, ahhh . . . so much to do and so little chances.
Well folks, today was a very important day in the history of Reb today, along with Vodka and 
someone else who I won’t name,21 we went downtown and purchased the following: a double 
barrel 12 ga. Shotgun, a pump action 12 ga. Shotgun, a 9mm carbine, 250 9mm rounds, 
15 12 ga slugs, 40 shotgun shells, 2 switch blade knives, and a total of 4 10-round clips for 
the carbine. We . . . . . . . . have . . . . . . GUNS! we fucking got them you sons of bitches! HA! 
HA HA HA! Neener! Booga Booga. Heh. It’s all over now. This capped it off, the point of no 
return. I have my carbine, shotgun, ammo and knife all in my trunk tonight and they’ll stay 
there till tomorrow . . . after school you know, its really a shame. I had a lot of fun at that gun 
show, I would have loved it if you were there Dad. We would have done some major bonding. 
Would have been great. Oh well. But alas, I fucked up and told   about my flask. that 
really disappointed me  . I know you thought it was good for me in the long run and all 
that shit, smart of you to give me such a big raise and then rat me out.22 You figure it was 
supposed to cancel each other? God damn flask, that just fucked me over bigtime. Now you 
all will be on my ass even more than before about being on track. I’ll get around it though. If I have to cheat and lie to everyone than that’s fine. THIS is what I am motivated for, THIS 
is my goal. THIS is what I want “to do with my life.” You know what’s weird, I don’t feel like 
punching through a door because of the flask deal, probably cause 
I am fucking armed. I feel more confident, stronger, more God-like. I have confidence in 
my ability to deceive people, hopefully I’ll make it to April, but that might not happen. Ug, 
its been a busy weekend, I need to sleep, I’ll continue tomorrow."
EricHarris,Journal,"Yesterday we fired our first firearms ever. 3 rounds from the carbine. Taught that ground a 
thing or 2. I even had the 2 clips in my pocket while talking to Vodka’s dad about senior ditch 
day. God it felt great firing off that bad boy, and hopefully I’ll be able to get more than just 
4 clips for it. I dubbed my shotgun “Arlene” after Arlene Sanders from the DOOM books. 
She always did love the shotgun. Vodka’s OB [?] is looking fucking awesome, all cut down 
to the proper lengths. This is a bitch trying to keep up with homework while working on 
my guns, bombs, and lying. By the way, I bought that flask in the mall and I had a friend 
fill it up with scotch whiskey, only had about 3 swigs in the 3 weeks I had it. Plus Monday 
I gave my T and IC [tequila and Irish cream] to Vodka, just in case. I never really did like 
alcohol, just wasn’t my thing, but it felt good to just have around. That argument on the 
22nd was a real bitch, but I think I should have won a fucking Oscar. I even quoted a few 
movies, remember “what the hell am I gonna do now man?! What am I gonna do!?” that’s 
good ole Hudson from “Aliens.” Sounded good too. And hey god damn it I would have been 
a fucking great marine. It would have give me a reason to do good. And I would never drink 
and drive, either. It will be weird when we actually go on the rampage. Hopefully we will 
have plenty of clips and bombs. I’m gonna still try and get my calico 9mm. Just think, 100 
rounds without reloading. . . . hell yeah!
We actually may have a chance to get some machine pistols thanks to the Brady bill. If we 
can save up about $200 real quick and find someone who is 21+ we can go to the next gun 
show and find a private dealer and buy ourselves some bad-ass AB-10 machine pistols. Clips 
for those things can get really fucking bit too. woohoo, I’ll never have to take a final again! Feels good to be free. I just love Hobbes and Nietzsche. Well tomorrow I’ll be ordering 9 more 10-round clips for my carbine. I’m gonna be so fucking loaded in about a month. The big things we need to figure out now is the time 
bombs for the commons and how we will get them in and leave them there to go off, without 
any fuckin Jews finding them. I wonder if anyone will write a book on me. Sure is a ton of 
symbolism, double meanings, themes, appearance vs. reality shit going on here. Oh well, it 
better be fuckin good if it is written. Heh, get this. KMFDM’s new album’s entitled “Adios” and its release date is in April. How fuckin appropriate, a subliminal final “Adios” tribute to Reb and Vodka, thanks KMFDM . . . 
I ripped the hell outa the system."
EricHarris,Journal,"Jesus christ that was fucking close. Fucking shitheads at the gunshop almost dropped the 
whole project.24 Oh well, thank god I can BS so fucking well. I went and picked up those 
babies today, so now I got 13 of those niggers woohah. The stereo is very nice, but having 
no insurance payments to worry about so I could concentrate of BOMBS would have been 
better. Oh well, I think I’ll have enough. Now I just need to get Vodka another gun. Months have passed. It’s the first Friday night in the final month. Much shit has happened. Vodka has a Tec 9, we test fired all of our babies, we have 6 time clocks ready, 39 crickets [small bombs] 24 pipe bombs, and the napalm is under construction. Right now I’m trying to get fucked and trying to finish off these time bombs. NBK came quick, why the fuck can’t I get any? I mean, I’m nice and considerate and all that shit, but nooooo. I think I try too 
hard. But I kinda need to, considering NBK is closing in. The amount of dramatic irony 
and foreshadowing is fucking amazing. Everything I see and hear I incorporate into NBK 
somehow. Either bombs, clocks, guns, napalm, killing people, any and everything finds 
some tie to it. Feels like a goddamn movie sometimes. I wanna try to put some mines and 
trip bombs around this town too maybe. Get a few extra kills on the scoreboard. I hate 
you people for leaving me out of so many fun things. And no don’t fucking say “well that’s 
your fault” because it isn’t, you people had my phone #, and I asked and all, but no. no no 
no don’t let the weird looking Eric KID come along, ooh fucking nooo."
SeunHuiCho,Manifesto,"Oh the happiness I could have had mingling among you hedonists, being counted as one 
of you, only if you didn’t fuck the living shit out of me.
You could have been great. I could have been great. Ask yourself what you did to me to have 
made me clean the slate. Only if you could be the victim of your reprehensible and wicked crimes, you Christian Nazis, you would have brute-restrained your animal urges to fuck me.
You could be at home right now eating your fucking caviar and your fucking cognac, had 
you not ravenously raped my soul. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Can you feel the pain that you 
fucked us in, you Descendants of Satan? Well, can you feel it? All the shit you’ve given me, right back at you with hollow points. Don’t you just wish you finished me off when you had the chance? Don’t you just wish you 
killed me?  You had a hundred billion chances and ways to have avoided today, but you decided to spill 
my blood. You forced me into a corner and gave me only one option. The decision was yours. 
Now you have blood on your hands that will never wash off, you Apostles of Sin. 6 Congratulations. You have succeeded in extinguishing my life. Vandalizing my heart wasn’t 
enough for you. Raping my soul wasn’t enough for you. Committing emotional sodomy 
on me wasn’t enough for you. Every single second wasted on your wanton hedonism and 
menacing sadism could have been used to prevent today. Ask yourselves, What was I doing 
all this time? All these months, hours, seconds. Only if you could have been the victim of 
your crimes. Only if you could have been the victim . . . To you sadistic snobs, I may be nothing but a piece of dog shit. You have vandalized my 
heart, raped my soul, and torched my conscious again and again. You thought it was one 
pathetic, void life that you were extinguishing. Thanks to you, I die, like Jesus Christ, to 
inspire generations of the Weak and Defenseless people — my Brothers, Sisters, and Chil-
dren — that you fuck.
Like Moses, I spread the sea and lead my people — the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent 
Children of all ages that you fucked and will always try to fuck — to eternal freedom. Thanks to 
you Sinners, you Spillers of Blood, I set the example of the century for my Children to follow

on our face then give us a dirty towel to wipe away? Do they wanna rape us then give us

to patch up? Do they wanna perpetrate endless sessions of crucifixions and holocausts on our

they can’t fuck us any more than they have already done. I say there are no lies they can say 
about us that they haven’t already said. I say fuck you, you Descendants of Satan Disguised 
as Devout Christians. I say we take up the cross, take up our guns and knives and hammers, 
and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath and last ounce of energy. Seer of Veracity. Seal of the Anti-Terrorist. You wanna rape us John Mark Karrs? You wanna rape us Debra LaFaves? Fuck you.
By destroying we create. We create the feelings in you of what it is like to be the victim, what 
it is like to be fucked and destroyed. Because of your annihilations, we create and raise new 
breeds of Children who will show you fuckers what you have done to us. Like Easter, it will 
be a day of rebirth. It will be a start of a revolution of the Children that you fucked. You have 
never felt a single ounce of pain your whole life, thus, by destroying you, by giving you pain, 
we attempt to show you responsibilities and meanings of other people’s lives. It’s grand for you to fuck us 24/7 for fun, but we can’t have a single minute of harmless 
playtime, only suffer. It’s dandy for you to rape us, but we’re not allowed to even speak, only 
be raped? Fuck you.
You love to pretend to, but you Hedonists, Charlatans, Sadists, Rapists, Terrorists will never 
know the feelings of giving up your lives for a cause. You have never felt a single ounce of 
pain in your hedonistic lives. You will never give up a single can of your Bud Light, a shot 
of your cognac, or a half-drop of your own precious blood for another human being, only 
fuck the shit out of him and lie afterwards. You fucked us, now we fuck you, now we kill 
you. There can be no lighter penalty for Masqueraded Democratic Terrorists who commit 
unforgivable acts of treason against mankind. There is no where in the world you can run, 
you Lovers of Terrorism. There is nowhere in the world you can hide, you Lovers of Sadism. 
You will never know when and where the Weak and Defenseless that you fucked will strike 
— day, night, at school, in the public, in your home, during your most comfortable hour and 
protected place. You will never know how we will kill you — slash your throat, bullet in your 
back, torture you with knives, hammers, bolt cutters, scissors. You will always live in fear. 
You will never be able to go to school or work or rest or sleep. Your heart will always pound 
nonstop. Your sin-ridden soul will slowly eat up your conscious for the heinous crimes you have committed. So if you don’t want to die a painful death, do yourself a favor, do yourself 
a coup de grace, and kill yourself clean or you will endure pains you can never feel but with 
our hands. Kill yourself or we will hound you down and rip you, all your friends, and all 
your family into small pieces."
SeunHuiCho,Manifesto,"We have no sympathy in killing humans who have no respect for other people’s lives.  Now that the slate has been cleaned and you have the world’s attention, the question is what 
are you going to do? Are you going to admit the truth or are you going to stand resolute on 
your mission to eternally fuck the Weak and the Defenseless and lie about it? Are you still 
going to use your power and manipulate the truth to end up with some sort of profit as you 
have always done? Are you going to skip over all the crimes you’ve committed and act as 
victims to the world so you can suck in millions of donation money to turn the situation 
into a profit? Your two million dollar house wasn’t enough? Your BMW wasn’t enough? Your 
inheritances weren’t enough? You have to fuck and steal form the Poor and the Weak who 
have nothing in order to gratify your fucking pride and hedonism? What are you going to 
do with the blood money? Buy a new Mercedes? You want to brainwash your bratty, snobby 
kids that its right to steal from the poor, the Weak, and the Defenseless to always stay in 
power? The fat surpluses that you roll on everyday aren’t enough? Fuck you. Your answer 
rings loud and clear. I saw we take up the cross, Children of Ishmael, take up our guns and 
knives and any sharp objects, and take no prisoners and spare no lives until our last breath 
and last ounce of energy. The blood of the Innocents should never be shed, but the wicked we shall spread our wings and strike. We do not want the Weak, the Defenseless, or the Innocent, but the sadistic, the 
corrupt, and the wicked who prey and rape from the Weak, the Defenseless, and the Innocent. 
We will seek and demolish them until our last breath. You Lifetakers may have succeeded in 
raping our souls and shattering our dreams — but mark our words — the vendetta you have 
witnessed today will reverberate throughout every home and every soul in America and will 
inspire the Innocent kids that you have fucked to start a war of vendetta. We will raise hell 
on earth that the world has never witnessed. Millions of deaths and millions of gallons of 
blood on the streets. will not quench the avenging phoenix that you have caused us to unleash. Generation after generation, we martyrs, like Eric and Dylan, will sacrifice our lives to fuck you thousand 
folds for what you Apostles of Sin have done to us.
Pain of every atom between air and water, sky and ground, heaven and hell, life and death 
wouldn’t begin to explain the experience that we went through under your wrath.
What did you expect me to do, you violators of human rights? As the time approached, I wished for a last minute miracle and discard this mission you’ve 
given me. Heaven knows I wouldn’t hurt a single leaf of a flower. But when the time came, 
I did it. I had to. What other choices did you give me? All this time. . . You never know that 
a human being is capable of doing until you fuck him to the edge. When you’re raped of everything, you got nothing to lose. If you have a single milligram of conscience, a grain of integrity, a speck of heart, you will kill yourself for all the lives you have brutally extinguished. Can you now see all that used to be, all that could have been, and all that is to come, you Sadistic Charlatans. "

About 30 minutes into the movie, police say, around 12:30 a.m., he reentered the theater through the exit door. Holmes was dressed in black and wore a gas mask, a load-bearing vest, a ballistic helmet, bullet-resistant leggings, a bullet-resistant throat protector, a groin protector, and tactical gloves. He was listening to techno music through a set of headphones so that he could not hear anything from people in the theater. Initially, few in the audience considered Holmes to be a threat.

I hope my boom is left the same. If I had a razor blade I would leave a sample of a blood to this paper. One of the main parts of my depressions is Cristy. She bosses me around and dad loves her more than me. That drives me literally crazy. The end. Love, Kenneth Stuart Bartley. "
